Question,Answer
"Question regarding unlocking a drone: I have an assembled fpv kit drone (someone else put it together and I can’t find any good manual or videos online). I cannot get the controller to connect or arm the rotors. Should I plug it into betaflight to figure this out, or switch out components? If so, what should I switch? Unlimited budget",What receiver is in it and what transmitter do you have]
What gps is better https://rcmaniak.pl/pl/p/FlyFishRC-M10-Mini-GPS-Module/5440 or https://rcmaniak.pl/pl/p/HGLRC-M100-MINI-GPS/5363 ?,150Hz mode is just bad for Crossfire
F722 is better than F405 right?,"not really. It's probably faster, but it has less uarts and the like I don't even know for sure if it's faster"
Performance wise. There’s obviously a size difference but is there also a huge performance difference?,I have the flyfish gps on 2 of my quads. For a cheap small m10 u can't believe how good it is. I lock 10 sata in 90 seconds from a cold start. Once flying I get 22/24 sats.. Here you can see the rth. Not 100% accurate but close enough.
anyone can offer a getting started guide? like complete beginner never touched a drone before :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,"Oh, so it just comes down to extra features. I’m only familiar with the speedybee Bluetooth connection, do other FC’s work with the speedybee app if they have wifi:thinking_face: or is it different"
"ah thanks for the resources, i will definitely check them out!. and for fixed wing? thats what im more interested about",Look up how to get into the hobby and see what peaks your interest more. What to look out for and how to do everything properly (it gets more complicated but take it step by step and don’t overwhelm yourself)
"Hi there, I sold my Ender 3 and I have x4 5015 24V fan. Can I use them as quadcopter motor? I have tested them and they reach max 40V without getting hot.",was responding to using blower fans for a quad
do they achieve a thrust to weight ratio above 1? can you even get brushed escs for a quad in this day and age?,"if the batteries are even slightly different in voltage, they will *violently* equalize when you plug them in. the fuses might protect against this check with a cell checker that the voltages are within... I don't remember. read upa  guide on parallel charging I known, but I like recycle :recycling_symbol: components and give a second utility. Maybe for a light RC car , could work"

So I should charge all one by one?,multimeter also works but is more tedious
I see ok thanks. What do I choose here. and how does this work?. They are 6S 1300mah 22V,4. but you told be to do 1by1
1c?. Is that the current,battery max charging and discharging current is set relative to their capacity a battery with double the capacity can take or give double the current
"Watching it right now. I mean its 25 min.... Might take a little. What condition do I need?. 4.10V, 4.11V, 4.12V?. I might aswell charge one for now while watching. @Sea_Kerman. I see this on my charger. What is this?",The total pack voltage and the voltage of each cell. Very important.
my charger can check it only one by one. And I checked it. Lowest battery goes down to 3.71 and highest up to 3.77. Difference google says is ~0.06. Would this be safe?,The fact that you have to ask means you’re not ready. https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/  https://oscarliang.com/parallel-charging-multiple-lipo/ Calm down. Watching 3 different videos now. Im not pluggin in stuff without knowing what Im doing. I didnt charge yet. Thats why I asked. I want to be as safe as possible. Non charging one by one and whiles thats happening Im watching videos. But they all have their own fuse so shouldnt that help from me making mistakes technically
"Hello guys, just finished building my first drone, and as expected. there is an issue. here you have a printscreen of my mission planner, the drone won't arm. on the armcheck thing, I disabled it to see if it will arm, but it doesn't. I have the pixhawk1 flight controler. Some of my solders are cold, but I don't think that it is the issue. do you guys know what could it be?","my mob 8 is showing rpm filter flag after i fly and disarm if i rebot bf via osd its gone Yes, my 30x30 Mamba F722 App FC works with the speedybee mobile app. it only apears after i land(rather messy landings). escs are runing bluejay 0.19"
what sd card r u using?,SanDisk Ultra 128 GB. I have two. One inside my Goggles and one Inside my O3
I need a U3 right?. my current one has 140 BM/s,Thank you for the reply. :Howdy: I do have a place where I can safely charge them so that shouldn't be an issue.  (its surrounded by brick and concrete and at least 4 meters from anything that can catch fire). That is an older model SD card and isn't high capacity. It's too slow for DVR I ordered two U3 A2 200Mb/s. They should do they Job That's 1u. So. It's slow Yep. Ordered 3U. Thanks for helping!
what's the issue exactly ?,"if what you are planning on is building is the world's lightest 8s whoop then you might have a chance to hover if the quad without motors is sub5g, other wise, they are probably way to underpowered to actually be useful for anything else than being a fan yo is anyone willing to go in call w me and help me flash bf:loudly_crying_face: i jus want to flash betaflight bc i switched the props and i dont wanna mess with the stock tune, i would rather just retune it myself why would changing the props make you reflash B.F so i just want to flash betaflight and make sure i dont screw anything up. im getting lots of mid throttle oscillations and such and i want to retune it you don't need to flash B.F for that i dont want to mess with the stock tune. i also just want to flash bf. and have the newest version on my quad"
did you copy your preset ?,"or else, you will have to reconfigure everything, not just the tune yeah i kinda want to reconfigure everything"
Is that solder good ?,"as if it was a fresh built quad is it leaded 63/37. you should still copy the presets so you still have a preset where you know the quad works in case you screw up has for the tune, you might want to try a few presets, like the karate preset for  exemple true. so what exactly is a preset it might solve your issue way faster than a complete retune well I can't help you then. it's a premade tune. well, usually it's a tune, sometimes it can be a full configuration, but it's usually just the tune so if i save my current preset. put it on. then put a preset tune on and if you get from karate or uav tech for exemple, it should be really good, if your quad ressembles the one they used has a reference it will give me the new tune. but the old config you will have a new file on your computer, and you can choose to load it or not, once bf is re flashed, it's like it's a new quad yeah. im saying like hypothetically. i flash bf. load the old preset. then load a different pre set tune so you should load the old backup, then select a tune, so all the ports are still right, same with the rates, and you have a preset tune has well"
it will have the config from before. but a new tune?,"kk. can i load this preset from bf 4.3 on 4.5. i jus wanna make sure it should be reverse compatible from like, the first bf versions to the last one. there is no reason why it couldn't work well, if it's a 2s battery it's fine It's 2s. Was more worried about the difference well then it's perfectly fine. .13v of difference on a discharged battery is fine https://tenor.com/view/this-is-fine-gif-25423531. Alr. Thx"
check wiring and maybe show a picture of the antenna?. it could have gotten loose from the connector?,"ufl is fine too. wiring is good. no loose solder joints either I mean you can do the bench test real quick, but there must be something broken here or set wrong. <https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/pre-1stflight/#bench-test>"
how does hte mobeetle 6 work in toothpick configuration for outdoor flying?. am i better off looking at a different toothpick drone? saw the crux recommended but i want an elrs drone. definitely want 1s compatible),"Crux is 3"" and comes in an ELRS version"
what's on your esc?. just flash it with bluejay or am32 and then you know it's supported,"KM60 BL32-60A 4IN1 3-6S ESC BLheli32 128K DShot1200 4-in-1 ESC: Input voltage: 3-6S LiPo Con.Current: 60A Peak Current: 80A≥ 10S Firmware: BLHeli_32 Support : Dshot 600/1200 Mounting hole : 30.5mm/M3 BEC: No. Skystar you can flash am32 to it. <https://esc-configurator.com/>. or. just update blheli32 to the latest. but am32 is nice. <https://github.com/am32-firmware/AM32> am32 is a new one to me ill take  a look cheers mate. Always used BLheli32 So im gettgin messages but cannot get sats at all. ive used INAV, and Ardu with 2 different GPS units and different settings. checked wiring and UART channels still no luck so if any of yall have any ideas i would love it ive tried ardu on one of the GPS's outside but didnt have any luck. im trying with this one again i had loads of trouble with getting sats on a cold start once, left it outside for like 15 mins with fc connected to a battery pack (obviously make sure that the vtx is not powered) and when i tried it again it worked give it 2 minutes on a cold start at least. minimum I just have the GPS and FC plugged in, no battery. It's connected over USB, GPS has power make sure it's pointed up. not obstructed Current setup, that sticker came with the GPS should work. I'd move it off of the laptop. as far away if you can Omg. I have sats. Holy shit this thing better work in ardu now. Time to try the other GPS and see if that was the main issue"
could you hold it tight and spin the screw?,maybe cut out the nylon. and it looks like thats a heatsink so you could probably pull that off and get at it
Do you want 30 or 60 fps video?,2.8k 60fps or 4k 30 for runcam thumb pro Well Ig 60 but I realistically won't be slowing down footage so 30 will do
"Hi there, I asked to ChatGPT which motor could I use for a drone and for a RC car. The answer was 1000kv  I wanna  buy motors that MUST be versatile, I mean , I 3d print a drone and if I don't use it in winter, I can dissemble the motors and assemble into a 3d printed RC CAR.  Do you think 1000kv motor is the right choice?","Well motors for rc cars and drones are completely different and 3d printing a drone doesn't work out the best your answer has ZERO information. seems like to talk to my son and sayin ""look men and women are different, 1 has something that the 2 doesnt' have"" the issue is you've asked this when most of the people who are able to fully articulate why what you're trying to do will be... suboptimal are asleep Yeah he's correct, I'm just saying that it probably won't work out but don't per say have specific and in depth explanation to why.. And mostly cars have a engine which rotates a shaft and drones have 4 per prop. And 3d printed drones do not fly well because of vibrations and fragility Just buy 2 sets of motors tbh, and the issue wiyh 3d printed frames is that the fragile. Or they have vibration issues etc. But its possible, probably best on a small scale. I used to make rc cars that were powered by 1 motor with a propellor, maybe that is something for you"
Does anyone know the O3 MSP baud rate?,"Drone motors are usually too fast and too small for any reasonable RC car. The 2210 1000kv motors are okay for a larger prop drone, still seems very high and small for a car. Most people here are experienced with drones, not cars. So the answers will be coming from that perspective. Kv is the speed, CW/CCW are older options in cases where you couldn't reverse the direction"
Do a few raindrops affect a drone?. Like just a Little,"Depends on where they land If they land on the frame, nothing will happen. If they land on the electronics, that could be worse"
I believe it should be 115200.. Send a pic?,Well you do have *some* versions of the xt60 that can be rounded like this photo of an xt60i on an ecoflow cable or this connector from a random seller https://mon-fourgon.shop/electricite/connecteur-xt60-femelle A picture would really help
question for the plane bros: is it realistically possible to build a plane out of cardboard that utilizes 6-8 coreless motors *and* make it fly?,Take the bell off. And scrub both the rotor and stator
Is vodka good enough? I don't think I have any pure alcohol stuff at home. Otherwise I'l go buy alcohol if you know any names,"try it, should be good enough. or if you have the time, go to your local pharmacy, they should have 70% alcohol It is possible, yes.. These kits are really really terrible electronics. Take a look at the types of electronics kits FliteTest sells, that should give you an idea of what electronics are good to put together"
Multiply?. Isopropyl alcohol evaporates very quickly,"Don't know about vodka tho but I believe you. Thanks for the help all! Vodka is pretty pure, should work fine. It'll evaporate pretty quickly too"
"I mean, for quadcopters you just calculate the power-to-weight ratio. If it's around 2-3 you're good. How does that work for planes? How do I know that I have enough power to take off?","RC airplanes almost universally have way more thrust than they actually need. A real Cessna 172, for example, has a TWR of like 0.25. Most ""trainer"" RC airplanes are actually around 0.6. Static thrust in an airplane primarily affects its ability to accelerate, not its ability to stay in the air--that's taken care of by lift on the wings. As long as you can meet the minimum maneuvering speed, you're good Ah, kinda though they would be terrible for such a price :/ .  I checked out Flite Test kits and they look promising and better quality, but the problem is that the shipping for me would be ~70 Eur for me. Do you know of any reputable EU online stores with such kits. Much appreciated. Thanks. I pointed you to the FliteTest kits for reference, not for you to purchase. Just find matching harwdare at any retailer you want to purchase from. You don't need a kit, you can part it out and not pay any more than you would buying a kit. thank you for the explanation :D I cant flash my radiomaster pocket with ELRS internal"
Did you follow the driver installation steps in the guide?,"The error you're getting is what happens when you don't have the drivers installed https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/ yeah it is recognised correctly ,i downloaded driver that fixed that"
"can you see the propellers on the dji o3 air unit with the APEX EVO 5"" FPV FRAME?",I will print a gearbox with more number of teeth to adjust the torque printing stuff that can spin at over 10 thousand RPM doesn't seem like a great idea **Several** youtubers would like a word I've only printed stuff that spins at... *[does some math]* 1/1440 RPM. But fast spinny thing from FDM printer does sound like a poor idea
are u asking because u want to record with the O3 or just visually in the googles?,"well depending on your requirements regarding recording quality i would still mount a gopro or whatever on the drone. i personally stopped recording with the O3 on my 5"" and above because gopro simply outperforms it by a lot.  if u dont need that quality, usually the recording needs to be stabilized. thats being done via Gyroflow. For the footage to be stabilized it needs to be trimmed, so u will lose possible props in view. If u still have props in view, there are also ""clear"" props which arent so obvious in the recording like the HQprop S5 Light Grey cinematic. here https://oscarliang.com/dji-o3-air-unit-fpv-goggles-2/ are a bunch of settings for better recording as well as gyroflow and so on. it would also help if you click on the thingies u have like controller link system, location etc. in #extended-roles  so we can recommend local vendors and correct RX/VTX stuff :slightly_smiling_face: oh thanks and i think im just gonne use those gray props because they also look quite nice and if i dont like the on biard recording quality i can still buy a gopro afterwards because ive also seen really good o3 footage its good (o3) but its not gopro like :slightly_smiling_face: but as i said, it depends on your requirements but a 5"" can carry a gopro or whatever action cam. if your main concern is recording you probably want a deadcat frame. o3 looks fantastic, especially to normal folks with ND filters on it its pretty good yea i dont need cinema quality yet but i can still get a gopro if i want to at some point but for now o3 is enough i think. i think spitzebirne32 has a good point with stabilisation and the gray props and ive heard that for freestyle a deadcat frame feels kinda wierd hence the ""if your main concern"" ye that isnt my main concern so gray props should be enough"
"are tmotor p1604 motors too weak for a 400g 4inch with biblade propellers?. i tried to fly it but the motors just spin up to the max and then turn off even if I apply throttle. on the bench with no props, the motors spin to max properly","well if it aint flyin, then it probably aint good enough im going to try it with a smaller battery if you want, but i recommend you get stronger motors, since its not gonna be much of a difference and you're gonna run out of battery quick its 320g with a 850mah and 400 with 1100mah ye i normally make batteries with these. However Im wondering if I can use P45A instead of P45B. They are rated 30 AMP and not 35 amp."
what motors should I get for the 4 inch build?,the picture i gave you has 45amps... and the P45A has 40amps... i want a action cam too so itll be around 650g i guess. 6s ah my bad. i thought mine says 30 amp
how many batteries a pack?. 6?,"ye. I was by mistake looking at P42 like a idiot. u are right. its 40 and 45 amp the 45B are currently plentifully available, so i don't see how you're having trouble with it.. https://www.akkuteile.de/molicel-inr21700-p45b-4500mah-li-ionen-akku-3-6v-3-7v_100852_3119 Here in germany they easily got over 50. with extra options. they ship international. tho shipping is 14.91$. ive got a drone that is similarly heavy. just a lil bit less.. wait a second ima look up what motors i got real quick, they should be good for your drone too"
should I jump straight to new motors or should I try triblade props first?,"try those, it might work. since jumping from biblade to triblade makes a considerable difference."
okay ill try that first. what motors do you have on your drone?. i thought 1604 2850kv 6s was on the higher range tbh,"i just forgot, you got a 4 inch build. i got a 5 inch build. my motorsize might be too big. but anyways. Xnova 2207 1800KV im just thankful all the stuff actually works and spins my friend got a 3.5 inch build so around 600 or 650 grams and uses the Xnova 2203.5 2400KV motors. these might suit you at a lower kv since that would be too fast for your drone okay ill check those out. cheers mate"
hey so my gf is getting me a tinywhoop for my birthday soon and we decided on the mobula6  i found a unit on aliexpress and i would appreciate if someone could check for me if its legit and if i will be able to use my gear on it. i have a radiomaster pocket and for goggles the eachine 800D  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006818908368.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.11.2aedDuKfDuKfud&algo_pvid=b7f6d1ec-80e7-402f-94d8-b89953a080e8&algo_exp_id=b7f6d1ec-80e7-402f-94d8-b89953a080e8-5&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21ILS%21465.16%21465.16%21%21%21121.25%21121.25%21%402103835c17146809482744890e4104%2112000038404433168%21sea%21IL%212677845746%21&curPageLogUid=SjT3rAOn42RM&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A#nav-moretolove,"if the seller is trustworthy. sure dude has 94.1% positive reviews out of 219 what do the negative ones say. @GhoastBee it is compatible. 5.8 analog, 2.4 elrs negatives say negative stuff the store is incredibly poorly rated. for alie standards. and they seem to not really keep stock of things so i guess i should steer clear. of that store. what is a good rate for alie standads 4.8 is usually a bit low. 4.9 is good"
you mean o3 is better ?,"It's not a big difference vs the moonlight. It's slightly better, and the quality of the camera is also slightly better yup, ever so slightly. but walksnail has better low-light and basically everything else"
"Hello, I just found a cheap old Dji air unit on eBay and the bid ends soon. Would it fit on a 5” freestyle using the speedybee master 5 v2 frame?",Can one of you guys tell me whether I should keep my props on after a crash or just replace them even tho the drone works fine. Cuz the tips of the props are a little wore off but flies fine depends how badly damaged they are. you can usually bend them back. probably change them if your motors get hot or if you see jello in your video
"is it a standard 5"" build?. for freestyle","ive got another little question what motors should i use you can ask me specifics to my usecase if that helps but i want to build a 5"" and have no idea wich motors are right for me yes it is freestyle and a little cinematic flying is my plan at the moment I'd refer to this. <https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner>. I'd go for 1950kv motors, 6s of course. that's the most common right now"
but what is different about it then?,"kv is like ""speed"". > “KV” indicates the number of revolutions per minute (rpm) a motor turns when 1V (one volt) is applied without any load (e.g., propeller) attached to the motor. For example, a 2300KV motor powered by a 3S LiPo battery (12.6V) will spin at approximately 28,980 RPM without propellers mounted (2300 x 12.6). KV is typically a rough estimation specified by the motor manufacturer.. <https://oscarliang.com/motors/>"
and why do you need a lower s battery with higher kv?,Voltage sag and battery throughput
Why wouldnt you and what is a better option?,"Ive heard of voltage sag but i dont really know what it is and the same thing goes for battery throughput You'll have to search these answers on your own as these are basic electricity concepts. and read this thoroughly. <https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/>. voltage sag is when the batteries voltage goes down under load because of a multitude of reasons including not being able to put out enough power And a last question should i get a speedy bee f4 or f7 because ive heard that it doesnt make a big difference and the f4 is a good bit cheaper I wouldn't get speedybee to begin with The F405 V3 stack had a lot of issues. The V4 is better, but they still don't have an amazing record. I'd go with Skystars or Diatone iFlight AT32 stack is also fun Oh yeah those are out now"
"is Airbots ""beta"" little FC trustworthy?. it seems really neat","Joshua Bardwell sais it isnt that bad and good for its price https://youtu.be/VdKyce03QTw That video is a year old and the V3 had a massive hardware flaw that was verified by the developers Oh ok sorry but i dont know if i want to get a Skystars or Diatone Speedybee semed like a good option and if you say the v4 doesnt have those problems i dont know why not to get it I'm not a big fan of speedybee for what they do with their software. Their modern hardware is *fine*, but you can get better"
What is wrong with their software i thougt the software on the most flihht controllers is betaflight isnt it?,"Yes, I'm mostly talking about their app and how they manage it So you mean betaflight sorry for asking but i dont know if betaflihht is owned by speedy bee i thought almost every one is using betaflight Betaflight is a completely independent open source project"
But what do you mean with speedy bees app then?,"The speedybee app is ""compatible"" with it and allows you to configure FCs. There's a chance they're breaking the licenses of the various projects they cram in the app, and there's also some pretty serious stuff that was requested to be private"
So betaflight is running on top of the speedy bee app?,"No. Betaflight has nothing to do with it. They just made it somewhat compatible and profit off it. If they're not breaking any licences in the process, that's okay. But I don't think they just reverse engineer everything If you wanna hear my thought process: Fly the cleanest props on hand. If you only have beat up props left, fly the ones that are the least beat up.  However, if swapping the props would cause a marginal improvement while reducing remaining flight time considerably, screw it, go fly.   As for deciding if props are too beat up - if I can really hear it, it's too much. (slight whistling is fine) If the edges look like saw tooths, it's too much.  If there's a significant chunk missing off a blade, also nope. Balance is important!  I do this to save the motors and ESCs, which cost me more than props.   There is one kind of flyable prop damage that is, imo, most dangerous - bent blade, especially at the root.  If a blade is bent off axis or off angle, it will wreak havoc. I dont really care what they are doing witht the licenses that isnt my problem in my opinion and i dont need to use the app if i dont want to i can configure betaflight on the pc as well if i understood correctly As someone who works on Betaflight projects, maybe I see it a little differently. Yes you can use the official tools on a PC instead Ye ok i think ill just use speedy bee because i dont know about everything they are doing but thanks for your help"
Will you pay me if I send you the link to the official apk release? :TrappyGiggle:,Do you think vetaflights devs in the future might do there own mobile phone version. I'd even pay for it to download.. I'd yoy connect USB to your phone then to your fc. Iif I can configure all my fc in the field with betaflight yes. By connecting USB c to my phone and fc yes yes yes https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/tag/10.10.0. Apk in assets
"It's the debug one ?. Ok, well turns out I'm stupid and it's indeed that one. Works a lot better than the Linux portable one. I like the irony of you having a rant against speedybee, but there is the speedybee logo taking a fifth of the home page","Here's a hint, android is based on the Linux kernel, and one of the files has ""portable"" on the name Should be the 2nd one from the top Thank you! So much. Really didn't know this existed. I don't make those decisions :downcast_face_with_sweat:"
"Yeah I know that, I just like the irony. Btw, while you are here, I was wondering, how did you become an official betaflight dev ?",Made the website with @un!t That was fun :party_popper: (I didn't even knew there was a website)
what abt baby ape. same prob?. @Vitroid,"Totally disagree i fly 2 stacks 0 problems since 1 year Started analog now using walksnail. Analog just for 2 montha They may have survived your use, but there's no disagreeing with the hardware issues I disagree with the fact as i do not have any evidence for it that is all i have to say and it crashed like 10000 times too .... It's literally a flaw in the design of the entire board. The analog OSD chip being on the same bus as the SD card is a silly mistake that's now likely on hundreds of thousands of boards. It was verified between Betaflight developers and speedybee themselves I am not here to argue with you. All i am saying i have 2 speedybee stacks for 1 year and 0 problems with them It may not affect your use case, but that doesn't change that it shouldn't've been made that way in the first place. And the fact that it passed testing makes me question what else they pass what yall think abt tinyape freest;yr Not great. You're stuck with their frame and motors unless you change both For now they're not really competing. But when the time comes to get the official configurator to proper mobile standards, that may change. They use weird old motors that have weird mounting sizes, and the frame only accommodates those"
what is afaik. @Vitroid. whic 2.5 inch is better?,No need to mention me every other message ok. which 2.5 inch is good
yes. analog. what do you think?. .,"something inside me wants to say TH II freestyle, but building your own is 10x better"
im confused  what size is the crux 3 1s?,"why does the 35 look soo much bigger i'm confused too. let's be confused together then would love to but every part is gon take lots of time to deliver from ali express no it's 3"" confirmed."
so the inches are the prop sizes?. not drone size directly?,"no, inches always tell you the prop size. the size of the frame can be anything (within reason). but usually pretty similar, as there is no reason to make the drone bigger than necessary @i'm bot @TheSovietWaffle any ideas preebuilt"
"can you stop spamming, good sir?","you can make a post in #help-with-drones and wait for someone to respond, because selecting a drone is not a ""quick-question"" and you have a higher chance of someone seeing your question in there no clue man i got me aa crux3 with elrs"
"pretty good, but if you want to use a cam with it a naked runcam is what it maxes out. what do you need it for?","out. my m,om told me to touch grass"
is it elrs?. https://www.getfpv.com/darwinfpv-tiny-ape-freestyle-2-5-quadcopter-expresslrs.html. this perhaps. but ask around i have no clue if this is good. it has up to 3s batt support and elrs. is analog and has up to 600mw vtx,yes. exactly. so is it good/ :shrug:. i dont know just got into the hobby myself
just wait for it to cool down. @Vitroid  is this good for freestyle?,:loudly_crying_face: scared for it to explode it wont explode unless overcharged or pierced
how can i check if its pierced?,okkkk thank you. scared fr. but itll be fine. ill let it cool and then ill charge it. i got imax lipo balancer gl. tell me if it exploded DarwinFPV stuff has a reputation to be very unreliable and in some cases a fire hazard. Ether you get a fun working quad or a bomb sounds like a fun gamble
what exactly is cw and ccw?,That's the part I'd be worried about. Not the batteries being warm lmao i heard its a good charger Clockwise/counter clockwise
then ill buy a new one :Harold:. any recommendations?,WIP list here https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging
whats the diff between DC and AC?. (in meaning of charging lipos),DC chargers need an external PSU. AC chargers have one inside aight :Howdy:  then ill go for AC
"so, do I need to get 2 CWs and CCWs each?",Doesn't matter. You can reverse the direction in software
So do you know if they will stay a sponsor when this comes ? (And will there be a Bluetooth standard by BetaFlight ? Because the one from speedybee was extremely un reliable on my GEPRC span fc,"I don't control the sponsors, not sure. The Bluetooth implementation should be fully open Yeah I know you don't control them, but maybe you had info on it, but also, it's nice the Bluetooth thing will be open source cause it was pretty cool, *when it worked*"
And you can already use ELRS wifi. Nylock nuts on whoops? :TrappyGiggle:,"Ah fair point--I didn't scroll up even one click. Now I hate motor plugs even more I come across videos suggesting taking video on 24fps rather than 60fps, I feel a bit conflicting but I wanna know what u guys think. Always 60 imo. 24 being cinematic is worth jack sh!t if freestyle moves look like a slideshow cant agree more 24 gets me motionsick"
"so, there are no pros and cons to CWs and CCWs? are they just the same?",They do spin different ways by default
Also! currently my single battery is dead :sleepy_face:  so i shouldnt use imax until the charger i bought will arrive?,"Yeah, just watch it carefully sure, ill use balance mode no lol. they have different advantages yeah I already see it myself, idk why there are people suggesting it for example in one direction, when you bump into something, it will suck up into it, so if you were to hit a tree, you would tangle into the tree, but with the other direction, you bounce off of whatever you touch for your drone to fly, you need to have the opposite (diagonal) motors spin in the same direction. any other configuration won't fly. make sure the props are installed according to the motor direction. make sure the props are not upside down. (text is usually up). If your question is about ""props-in"" or ""props-out"" configurations, I'd suggest props-out, because of both performance benefits and dirt is not thrown in your camera."
how to know when should i disconnect the battery? i know the imax beeps when i should disconnect the battery but idk im pretty scared about this charger,"It should stop on its own If it doesn't stop over 4.2V, stop it yourself"
I have a question what is the use case for a cinewhoop carrying fullgo pro like a 35 cinewhoop or a lightweight drone with a naked gopro like a cinelog 25? Which would you choose for what cinematic recording what enviroment ? How would you handle it?,"If you need to do any inside shots you'd pick the 2.5"". otherwise you'd probably use the 3.5"" for everything"
Interesting. Why not 3.5 inside ?,"It'll get stuck on walls which makes it hard/impossible to fly and also more dangerous. and also if you can I'd run the 3.5"" naked as well. everything profits from not having a heavy gopro on it I am scaried xd. For breaking it. And i thought getting fullgo pro instead. But i am not sure now i ordered flywoo deceased one Lol my english xd. Xd. You know what i mean i hope xd"
"Decased? You were pretty close. In terms of flying naked or not, I prefer to fly with a fully cased gopro because I crash sometimes in water, or I fly in storms. But if you're just flying indoors or outdoors and have low risk of crashing a naked camera is fine",Haha yes decased well there is always a risk of crashing :unamused_face: for example into a tree that pops off all of the sudden
like can i use these on my analog goggles. https://www.racedayquads.com/products/iflight-crystal-hd-5-8ghz-rp-sma-stubby-antenna-2-pack-for-dji-lhcp?variant=32214395584625. they seem normal. i want to get them for my goggles. they are stubbies but i need them to be. anything is better than the stock ev800d antennas. and even if they arent its at least smaller. and they are rp sma so i wont need to get an adapter,whats the diff between a dji hd ufl antenna and a regular analog one. can i just get an antenna meant for dji and use it. so far the only difference i see is they are usually lhcp which isnt a problem. i am upgrading my goggles antennas too so i can get lhcp some of the dji antennas need to be dual band I think. unsure
Is there anything bad about charging a 650mah bat at 1a than 0.5a?,i have them and i always charge at 0.5a. just for safety. 0.15a less than 1c is much better than 0.35a more than 1c. then again some people charge at 2c
@stryker why do you always charge them at 0.5a?,"safety. better to charge at slightly less than 1c then a good bit more than 1c. hey vit can you help me out with this real quick. . these seem fine, but im worried there is a difference im not noticing in between dji antennas and analog ones as long as u are aware of this, it should work so the only dif is the polarization. gotchu. tysm. ima get these and some ufl lhcp antenna for the kwad analog is usually RHCP. So with analog u will lose significant range because its LHCP im replacing everything so il jus get lhcp on everything not sure why u would replace everything with LHCP, but you do you also not sure if that will fix your initial ""problem"" its cheaper bc less people want it. and its in stock more. bc everyone gets rhcp. the stock ev800d antennas just have insanley bad range as i said, if u are aware of the polariation its fine. but if you buy another VTX or drone, u will also need LHCP again. assuming its also analog ofc yeah. i just cant forget im using lhcp now. thanks for the help broski before buying i would give https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment/video a read and see  whats being suggested/recommended and on my quad i have a dipole antenna still lmao. i gotta get rid of that"
"I got the whoopstor v3 I tried it with my 11V 4A 44W USB C charger but it said ""INPUT LOW"". Now my question is: Shall I use my Laptop charger and plug it to the DC plug on the whoopstor? It should input 19V 9A 180W","that should be plenty, weird. that would work"
"Why isnt the USB C working tho?. it also says ""Connect a device that supports the fast charge protocol 761""",the whoopstor 3 supports USB PD and QC
Where can I see it on my charger?,I'm not sure what you mean by that Forget it but thank you for your help
more mw on the drone means more range?,As long as the antenna part of the antenna isn’t damaged. Usually but distance is not 1 to 1 to mw. The quality of the vtx and antenna can also affect range. Also doubling power only increases the range by 50% It doesn't look like it bot sure what it's supposed to look like under that cap lol
if i increase it on my drone do i need to increase the power on any other gear?,As long as it doesn’t look broken it should be fine. But if you notice a quality decrease you should switch it out because you don’t want to much SWR. Nope
Do you already have a list put together?,Yes but it's needs changed as it's not what I want on terms of flight time it's more geared towards racing fpv
From what I have seen you want a cini type drone?,Yes looking for around 15 minute flight time. Maybe not insanely fast but fast enough
Are you super concerned about freestyle and durability?,"why settle for fine when you can have best for cheaper Some people enjoy using crossfire but elrs is newer and better Im not concerned so much about durability so long as it provides protection for main flight controller and I don't plan to be regularly doing flips etc You can get 3 CNHL blacks from a US warehouse for 50 dollars from their own site. ELRS is cheaper and better, go for 2.4"
I'll try and swap to elrs I'll have to look again. Well. The remote is 4 in 1. I can keep that right?,"TX16S is large, unless you want to do long range where you look at its screen and such and not actively wear goggles I'd go for something smaller. yeah, or you can pick internal expresslrs for it. I also thought your goal was more efficiency, I'm unsure about the eco's efficiency I would like for it to have decent range Okay so I have seen some people use t motor motors and light frames and they get over 30min flights unless you plan on doing analog video below 5.8GHz, ELRS 2.4 won't be an issue People have used 25 mw to go over 50km"
Something like that instead of crossfire?,You can get internal elrs in the tx16s. If you concerned about power the boxer has 1w internal I would suggest this <https://pyrodrone.com/products/betafpv-superg-nano-transmitter-module-elrs-v3-3-2-4ghz-choose-color>. if you're not going for internal elrs I dunno what I'm going for lol
Or this^. Is this your first drone?,"Welll technically yes. I bought that years ago. Never got beyond frame and motors. So alots changed since I last looked at doing this If I were you I would get a drone that is capable of both freestyle and cine because until you actually fly you could regret getting a bigger slower quad I guess that's in line with what I really want then every freestyle drone is capable of cine, not every cine drone is capable of freestyle. that's fun I bought a parrot bebop years ago used and crashed it after 5 minutes it's a paper weight now The crux 35 can get 20+ min flight times with the right battery, can freestyle, and race if you have local community.. It might be a good option or you can make a build similar to it I really like the yellow speedybees frame If you have a printer you can make any frame yellow. And also, I wouldn’t recommend anything larger than a 3.5in to a beginner because 5in can be dangerous. Those would work. Just get some TPU Im not trying to fly nothing small. Cause eventually I want to use these parts to experiment with. So that's a factor in choosing the fc Well with today’s motors and ESC’s a 3.5 can do basically everything a 5in can. That’s fair. But 5 year old motor wouldn’t work super well Im a tinkerer at heart but I'm also bipolar so I move rapidly from project to project lol Yea the motors I have now I bought like 2 years ago"
"Can I get the main reason you want this drone? To take go pro forage , just to fly or something else?. Todays motors are much more efficient but if you really want to use those you can",To fly up there when I'm bored. And watch the highway that's right next door :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Then I don’t get why you don’t want a 3.5in or smaller I don't really like the micro stuff. Like. Im also buying this to play with. For 150
Would you mind giving me a more straightforward reason?,I mean I don't want it to be small I feel 3.5 inches is tiny looking at a ruler.... It is the size of the propeller
How is that measured. Ok so if I said a 250mm drone what would that mean to you? Because that's the size of drone i researched years back,250 probably means the wheel base. Motor post to motor post People like to fly 65mm whoops like the mob 6. They are much more powerful than they were 2 years ago as well They look closer to 4 in I guess I'm fine with 3.5 So the crux 35 is a 3.5in and would be good to base a build off of to your specifications or you could just get it. Many people in this server have one
Am I restricted to certain fc?,No but I would recommend getting a stack. You are only really limited by the mounting holes. I hate to say this but I have to go. I would recommend putting together at least one part list and see what other people think. Good Luck!
to me it looks like there's plenty space down there?,"I’d like some advice, it seems like this battery lead needs to be like 1.5-2cm longer but I feel like at that point the capacitor won’t be doing much. Perhaps I could put the capacitor on some separate wires and tuck it under the vtx antenna bracket because there’s zero space inside the frame."
under that rear bracket?,"could put it between the wires. or even on top of the board the wires are going to. unless it's too big, hard to judge scale that's only about 4mm of gap, and the cap is 6.55mm in diameter. im thinking stick it here and loop the battery leads around it"
anybody know how to delete modes?. ah. ty,is there anything different between the antennas labeled HD and those that arent. logic says no but cooperate greed says idk
dies that X do anything?. ive never used bf so im not sure,i honestly didn't even see it. i think it should do it. yeah it totally did :loudly_crying_face:. i need to renew my glasses :skull:. hello any idea how to connect analog goggles i have a mobula 6 and orqa goggles and i cant seem to figure it out
2.1mm maybe?. its the only measurement on there,anyone know the lense diameter
"Hey Guys, I am building my first drone and already replaced the FC and ESC, but I can’t get the motors working in Betaflight… Although I hear the beeping 5 times… Do someone know what could be the issue? All parts are new",Get a screenshot of the Motors tab Sure. Everything in BLHeliSuite also seems fine
And it won't spin up when you move the sliders?,"Nope even on max 2000, nothing… Just read through that... Jesus's that ain't easy"
Is it bad for 1s batteries when I charge them with 1.5A instead of 0.3-0.5A? Like does A matter?,"Solved it, whoever end up in the same situation: https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1234610409986854973 Enable bidirectional esc and replug the lipo... yes, it very much does matter. if they're 300mAh, charging them at 1C would be 0.3A, you're doing over three times as much. given how disposable whoop packs are, it's probably not terrible, but it's a bad mentality to take forward to bigger batteries I have a problem for wich i couldnt get an answer in the official walksnail discord so i am asking here. I gor the goggles x and the nano vtx from walksnail build it, and updated the firmware. But they wont bind"
So it doesn't  damage the batteries? (btw yes I have 300mAh),"it does, but probably not fast enough that you'll kill them via charging before you kill them in flight"
How can I kill it in a flight?. Like drop the Voltage very low?,"that, or just over time"
"or will it die if I Accelerate too much. ""over time"" means about?. 1 year?",depends on how hard you fly them
"Any experts in Magnetometer. Quick question about setting the Magnetic Declination.   The betaflight guide states the following **""Declination values should be entered in decidegrees; in the above example, set mag_declination = 130 would correct for a 13° positive declination, and set mag_declination = 34 for positive 3.4° of declination. A negative local declination, eg -3°, should be entered as set mag_declination = 3570 (i.e. 3600 - 30).""**  Using the magnetic Declination website, I have worked out the location I will be flying from, which shows **Magnetic Declination: +0° 47'** Would i enter that in betaflight as SET MAG_DECLINATION=047 or just 47?","there's no right or wrong answer to that (iirc, it was from Daedalus) you can kill them in a week or two, you can have them stay alive for over a year (but the answer is obviously while supposing you don't burn them after crashing or forget about them while they are fully charged) Btw when should I stop flying. Like at what Voltage. LiPo 300mAh"
Is it one of the square cells ?. Or folded cell. (the tattu/lava/newbeedrone/tinywhoop etc stick batteries),"So it's a square/folded cell batterie. These batteries really don't have much voltage sag at all so don't wait until like 3.2v has on other cells, if you want to extend their life span, land at 3.5v, if you want more flight time, land at like 3.4v so it jumps back at 3.5, tho it will hurt the battery a bit more"
I see how much less of flight time is that?. if I land at 3.5V with a 4.2V 1s,It's going to be hard to say. The square cells are 4.35v. I would estimate like 20s more. But it depends on your flight style. And it is only based on mine you dont have to be exact. just numbers so I can imagine
"what should i pick for my 5"" freestyle drone?  1. Diatone Mamba Stack - MK4 F405 FC + 40A 3-6S BLHeli_S ESC - Mini 20x20 2. SpeedyBee F405 V4 BLS 55A 30x30 FC&ESC Stack 3. Skystars F405 Flight Controller OSD 45A Blheli_S 3-6S 4 IN 1 FlyStack","It will be my first time to fly so I need a number to compare Not the speedybee. Well, just land at 3.5v and voila. I don't know you flight style, so I can't give you real numbers, but on my 65mm with the same batteries, I get about about 3min30 to 3min50, and I get a few dozen more seconds if I land at 3.4 Thats what I want to hear thank you :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: But also, I have some 28000kv 0702 motors and I mainly fly outside doing more aggressive acrobatics than what you could do inside, so take that into account Hi:) I have a problem for wich i couldnt get an answer in the official walksnail discord so i am asking here I gor the goggles x and the nano vtx from walksnail build it, and updated the firmware But they wont bind"
Holding both for 10 seconds?. What do you need help with? It's already set up from factory,"Skystars or Diatone, I have diatone. Although you might need a high Amp ESC. 40 is alright as it probably does 50 burst, and most 5"" motors go till 45A on max throttle"
does anyone know if it's possible to use FPV goggles on a mavic 3?. specifically the version with the thermal camera,Which fpv goggles. And answer is prob no the FPV goggles v2. that's a shame
Like I saw a video where it did something with betaflight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0zRBIuaPp8. Or can I just connect my goggles and controller without this,"I don't know what's in that video, but don't follow it please. 99% of the time it messes something up. Plug it in so the receiver has power, might need a LiPo. It'll come up with a WiFi network after 30-60 seconds. with the password `expresslrs`. and then you can just put in your binding phrase"
How can I configure after?,Oh I see now I missread your text. What do you mean by this tho ELRS can bind using a password. you put it on your transmitter and receiver
Hmm?. It’s 9mm diagonal spacing,"quick question. if a motor is said to have a 9x9 mouint does it mean its 9x9 lengthxwidth. or 9mm diameter becuase thats what most ocmmon drawings of motors show. slightly confused for my frame design @Leah. she probably knows ye thought so thank you very much whilst i have your attention @Leah not sure how much you know about frame design but does this look somewhat useable. A little bricky for my taste but it should be fine. Not really sure. Would definitely get a second opinion How would I make it ""less bricky"" single bottom plate is gonna be a pain I want it sub 40g for the frame if possible. I'd sacrifice weight to get replaceable arms really. im trying to get somewhat close to the red kyte XDREI series of frames. its a 3"" i feel i should mention"
"im not seeing anything comparing the single antenna walksnail vtx to the dual antennavtx, and was just curious if anyone knows of what the difference is in link quality or any difference in performance?",diversity is always better
"Hello, i want to build a 6inch drone for cinematic shots with a gopro 8 on top. Which motors should i be using?

whats the best fpv drone for under 700€ ? i was thinking of a Nazgul Evoque F5,"If you guys have any better suggestions lmk! I can also build one myself, but I don't know what the firmware and software are like. i ve heared its not that fast tho. it goes with a go pro arround 140 km/h it's a regular 5"", it goes about as fast as any other. top speed is not as important as you might think. you will need to learn about the firmware and software regardless of if you build it or get it pre-built"
Contained within 700€?. Or 700€ just for the drone itself,"no. i have like 1,5k budget Could probably go with DJI or Walksnail then. Since I think iflight doesn't make any walksnail drones, you have DJI"
you mean like avanta 2 or something like this right?,No. You can use their video system for other drones. Like the Nazgul evoque
how can I bind my goggles on my drone?. EV800D to Mobula6,You just set them to the same frequency as the one that the VTX is transmitting on
sry i dont understand i m new to fpv. you mean i can build one myself and use their video system?,"yes. or you can get other drones with their VTX do you have like a list for all the parts i ll just order that ig. if you want you can send me a link for those there's nothing wrong with getting a BNF, just make sure that you know everything else like if you were building one okay. dont know what a bnf is but ig this means prebuild or some :loudly_crying_face:. thx for your help btw :red_heart:"
"alright, how do I calibrate it?","BNF (BInd 'n Fly) - a pre-built drone that already has a radio receiver in it so that it's ready to bind to your radio controller oh okay good to know thank you excellent question for google: ""how to calibrate betaflight current sensor"""
Which batteries can you guys recommend for this drone?,Thank you :slightly_smiling_face: i use  6s 1300mah and it lasts for 6-8mins without gopro etc i m gonna use a gopro then it wont last as long :face_with_tongue: i would guess it would lose up to 2 mins depending how ur flying :face_with_tongue: I cant even bind my drone with my controller
what controller/reciever?,"Radiomaster pocket. Mobula 6 2024 drone I need batteries that can provide as much flight time as possible (with a GoPro) more juice in a battery means its heavier, so you will lose more flight characteristics that will be up to you to figure out, theres some vids of people using nazgul with a li-ion but yea it will really only be able to cruise That's overpriced, just get it from China. Get 1100-1300mah 6s CNHL or GNB batteries. Post in #help-with-drones can you pls recommend me a fpv drone, goggles and a receiver under 1500€. which is also made for a gopro"
do you want to learn how to build ur own? joshua bardwell kit is on getfpv,the build part is not the problem. idk shit abt firmwares. and stuff like this. but yeah i m ready to try this aswell if you can recommend good parts he has a kit that comes with everything u mentioned except for gopro but ye he has videos on youtube setting it all up
sounds good do you have a link?. or nvm i ll just search up his name. ty,https://www.getfpv.com/beginner-diy-fpv-drone-bundle-qav-s-2-bardwell-se-5-dji-goggles-2-dji-o3-air-unit.html. if u want analog its even cheaper but im assuming u want digital. I just built this drone
yeah i want good quality xd. damn nice. for 1k right?. do you have a kit for 1.5k?,"damn that one isnt even available on tehre right now you might have to look around, also i dont know of any kits for that much , also the benefit of this kit is joshua bardwell walks u through it all and hes very thorough aight tysm :red_heart: np. antoher thing u should keep in mind is that if ur building ur own u will need to buy tools as well if u dont have them , n a charger etc etc oh yh i forgot abt the charger xd. :thumbs_up:"
any clue how i can get rid of the jello of my video in gyroflow?,gyroflow won't help with jello. that's a mounting/tuning issue
i mean  the runcam already uses gyroflow is there anything inside gyroflow that i can do?. got a full tpu canopy that the cam is mounted to,"it records gyro data for gyroflow to use, but that's about ir"
should i solder tx to rx and rx to tx on gps ?,tuning however i can see but there arent any presents for toothpicks. only 1
What toothpick do you have ?,"crux3. with a runcam thumb pro Then try the babytooth tune from fpv cycle. And if you have one of the super minimalist camera mount, try a stiffer one with more material hmmmm. its currently with this one, but havent tested with the runcam Try the babytooth tune"
where do i find it? is it in bf?,Use your typy fingers and search on Google. () I'm sure you can figure it out It's the tune yes. Just copy and paste the P.I.D. numbers
does betaflight 4.4 has gps rescue rth ?,"Yes, but 4.5 is completely overhauled and vastly improved"
What are some good lhcp patch and omni antennas for on a budget?,"Yes, always good practice. prodrone.pl For the Walksnail fatshark goggles also what telemetry protocol should i choose if i have expresslrs None, it's already included when you select CRSF"
also why when i'm flashing drone the inltating reboot to bootloader is still shwoing for like 3 min or 4 ?. it says failed to open serial port,"Because you do not have the STM DFU drivers installed, or you have a powered receiver or GPS connected to UART1 or UART3 in the right up corner. gps is connected Run the ImpulseRC Driver Fixer linked on the Welcome tab in BF. Unplug GPS or make sure it is not powered https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe"
What UART is the GPS connected to?,You can just unsolder the 5v wire to the GPS. No need to remove everything
can i unsloder gnd ?. or i need 5v one ?,"No, I would only unsolder power it worked!!!. so to set up gps i only need to turn on gps in configuration and then select gps on uart 1 in ports bc i soldered it to tx1,Rx1 In short, yes. Make sure auto config is enabled and you have set the correct baud rate. Follow the BF4.5 setup guide for configuring RTH yep it was auto and betaflight selected it. but i cant see gps logo. in betaflight idk why Show the output of `status` in the CLI And read the release notes: https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/release/betaflight-4-5-release-notes. It's not seeing the GPS Do you have it wired properly yeah i think so. I'm sure happymodel x12 aio. elrs one"
where can i see it ?. Dshoot300,"Post a CLI dump, I'll be back in a bit Paste this into the CLI:  ```feature -LED_STRIP set pid_process_denom = 2 save```"
i did it. oh wow. i can see gps logo. okey so. what should i do rc to configure it ?,Read the release notes I linked above
also can i put it near motor wires ?. okey. can i ?,"Yes, it has no compass. Although that is a huge GPS to use on that quad fr. look at the size bro where are you going to mount it have fun tuning it. with off balanced weight meh , it will probably work with out Thought it was heavier. I would mount it on top of the canopy, or inside the top of the canopy. Maybe on the back support somehow"
Get good. Why are you trying to put a GPS on this anyway?,"inside it won't fit. but outside i'll crash it practise make perfect. for fun. cuz i bought frame 3 g lighter. and gps is 2,5g. so i thouht maybe i'll put gps on it. but. probably. I'll do connector. to gps"
You know the point of a toothpick is to be has light has possible right ?,"ik. but its still super duper powerfull Then why are you adding useless crap onto it You will fly your toothpick like 50m away maximum I flown it 1km. also i lost it servral times A Gps isn't a magical anti loss silver bullet. And I flown a 5"" 4km on a 1300mah 6s, and a tinywhoop approximately 500m away, if you fly slowling anything can go far"
You mean the 3d fix ?,"i mean. when i'll know that i can start. quad You can start when you hit the on switch, but you can add a satellite counter on the osd and a real time readout of the quads coordinates, just use both to estimate when it has a homepoint lock, on an m10, you should wait for at least 8 gps But adding a gps on a toothpick is rather wasteful just want to test gps on fpv drones , if it will not usefull then i'll unsolder it Well, you will find it neat to have the speed for the first couple flights, but you will quickly realize it simply takes space on the screen and is basically useless for freestyle"
did you get the ELRS version?,This is the SKU from my order last year. https://www.getfpv.com/radiomaster-tx16s-mkii-2-4ghz-16ch-radio-transmitter-multi-protocol-w-hall-gimbals-v4-0.html yeahhhh you'll need an external ELRS transmitter module
Oh shoot. Is there a controller your recommend that would be better for FPV specific? I bought this controller when I was planning a fixed wing sig-int/EW payload project. It would appear FPV folks prefer smaller controller,"No, it's a great radio. If you want to fly wings and drones, it's really good. You'll just need to get an ELRS transmitter module to get it compatible with the current best stuff"
What sort of price range?,Looking to purchase high end that I won’t wanna upgrade for quite some time

"I want something that isn't too small, but not too cumbersome. I don't want a full on cinema drone. But i wan't the best quality video feed to the goggles themselves. Is the DJI O3 air unit the answer to that high quality FPV stream right now or is there a better option?",Less adrenaline pounding decisions is good
"Is it just me, or are the Sims harder to fly?",It’s just different. You don’t really think the same in real life as you do in a sim The reason I tor a piece of plastic of the pack is cuz I was doing loops of faith like a dummy and hit a tree branch mid air Yeah the plastic seems to peel easily and is a pain to keep from falling apart
Are there limitations with the o3 usage in goggles besides DJI goggles? Or can you use the O3 with other goggles,"quick question so i was flying my quad outside in my backyard then i lost connection. but i have never lost connection 5meters from my area. could it be the antana on DJI coming lose. because i still had control of my drone but i lost video. i took everything apart and the antanna look lose. but other 1 hard to pull out this happen to me twice anyway to make sure the antanna plug stays in my air unit Yea I’d love to build it. I want high quality because I have no interest in recording, I would rather have high quality FPV stream I'd personally go Walksnail. it's 95% of the way there to the o3's quality. and you get to fly small stuff DJI is a strictly locked down system. their new goggles don't allow you to do any inputs or easy antenna changes. and the older v2 is slowly being phased out I’d  prefer not to be locked to DJI gear to be honest. I’m a security software engineer and open source fanatic so it kills me to think about buying into that lol Walksnail is the same kind of locked down and suck at communication. but the goggles are open, you get inputs and software support. and they're just good goggles. and they don't want to get rid of any backwards compatibility. it's also cheaper if buying new"
Hdzero is also the same way. Not super cheap for the goggles though. I personally understand the want  to have high quality when beginning but when you’re actually flying you don’t notice it at all except when branches pop out of nowhere but if you have the money for digital and you really want it go ahead.. Also do you have a soldering iron and soldering experience?. And here is an example of a 3.5 in build that @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) made that you can get an idea of what stuff to get https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1223813972898353234 (it may be hard to find the specs but they are in there somewhere),"I don't agree with that at all fyi, half the flying I do is paying attention to the details and such very closely even with fast freestyle (Probably). I guess it is definitely a personal preference. I don’t mind but some people do > Grinderino 3.5"" frame, Axisflying (what a bad name) F7 pink AIO, Walksnail V2 Pro kit, RCINPOWER GTS V3 1804 2450KV motors Could *maybe* fit a whole Moonlight kit but unsure. I'd recommend you get a stack instead of an aio, it'd fit way better."
How is the f7 Aio holding up?,"I mean It's a fine AIO, it's definitely not the best though. the pads aren't in good spots. f722 is a bit meh Yeah the soldering is a little tricky so that's why I'd get a stack next time"
quick question having a dented motor is fine to fly ya if its not making any issues?,"I have another one laying around so I might try a 3.5 or a tiny trainer with it yup. mine now has chunks missing from it, as long as everything is still straight you're good. I do not regret 6s at all by the way, best choice I could've made. Yeah I used to do tons of hardware projects. I’m not shy to soldering. I have a sequre SQ 001.  It’s not bad. It’s good as long as the nothings rubbing you’ll be fine. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: idk why my dji air unit unplug an antenna mid air"
would be any other reason anyone?,tight fit with the vtx. Brace the coax with a zip tie and tape over the plug
"Nice. All you will need now from what I remember is drone parts, walksnail goggles or whatever system you want to choose, and a elrs TX for you tx16s.. Also do you have a battery charger?. For 2-6s lipos",its so tightly packed idk how it unplugs
I have the hobby mate D6 Duo Pro. Is that still a quality choice?,Probably not. You should get the hota d6 pro. It’s a lot safer and has 2 charging ports. Actually it is the hota d6 pro so your good there as well. But if you get another charger in the future get the hota d6 pro from hota and not hobby mate
Is their integration capability good? Like it will work with more than just Walksnail FPV cameras?,the new Walksnail goggles X are good
"does it matter which plug I use in my gps? it has one on each side, I assume its just to make mounting easier?","It's got AV in so i assume u can grab an adapter to see analog fpv feeds. something that was removed with the newer DJI systems. i think its even got HDMI in which makes it technically compattible with HD Zero or to be used in simulators yes. hdmi in, can run hdzero at full. can do analog with ease. etc"
Why tf did RadioMaster change the screws for the back of the TX16S and not have an option to buy the old version?. I waited almost 2 weeks for shipping and spent almost $10 on a pack of screws from them and they changed it so it's not even the right fucking screw,it's plastic it'll fit. otherwise just go down to a hardware store and match it. stop trying to use the internet Same pinout so It's safe to assume you can use either Wouldn't putting 2 differently threaded  screws into the same hole fuck up the threads in the radio
Do y'all know how to fix it ? https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1236629609617948692,If u provide more information someone might be able to help. But with just your sentence no one can help https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1236629609617948692 Well if u created a thread i would be nice to let people know here.
I have a nazgul5 with analogue video and a sky zone cobra X. I want to increase my video range as I just have the default antennas and they don’t have great range. Anyone know good antennas that will allow me to go further? Preferably a really long one to stop this problem when I face towards the drone the battery and GoPro blocks the antenna and makes the quality drop a ton,Have a look at https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment/video
How exactly does OSD work with Goggles 2?. I set my OSD and I somehow dont see it.,"If u have a non-dji drone, the OSD elements come from betaflight"
I know. But how does the setup work exactly?,To properly help u need to provide waaaaay more information
"Its a 5"" custom quad but on O3. What info do you need?",Everything because i literally only know u have an O3 air unit and G2
Well then how do I get OSD on my G2s?,If u provide more information about your drone and setup plus screenshots from betaflight we might do not need to ask our magic glass spheres F405V4 stack. RP1 receiver. Done about 99% of my setups now and all I need is my OSD. Betaflight screenshots please of the configuration and ports tab I have cideo but sadly no OSD Thats because msp is not set on the peripherals dropdown
what motor should I put in a meteor 75 frame?,Yes. There is a preset under the preset tab which u can use. Will configure everything  Search for wtf there
Wont that redo all my BF settings?,No but u can create a backup before
cant I just do it manually?. Im a big fan of that,Sure Peripherals needs to be set to ``` VTX (MSP+Displayport) ```. Of the UART where the o3 is connected sadly still no OSD... Wrong UART is a possible error
My O3 is Uart 1 Um pretty sure. otherwise I wouldnt even have video right?,"Or TX and RX swapped. No false The O3 only needs power to stream video. Thats it O3 Is plugged into my FC not soldered It doesnt care about uart connection to work U can have a o3 on your table powered via 9V and its happy. U will get video to your googles I set it to 1. ""UART 1 for OSD"""
Is RX from the O3 going to TX on your FC?,"yes. Its a plug as you can see Ok i dont care if its a plug. Check it. Never trust a manufacturer about the right order, check it for yourself"
How exactly should I do that?. I dont know what pins correcpond to what on the O3...,"U look at the plug on the O3, look up the pinout and check which wire goes where on the FC I know but where do I find the O3 pinout The wires should have different colors so its easy to follow then. Google"
I got rid of the yellow SBUS wire btw. Could that cause problems?,No. Thats the first thing i remove on mine
Looks exactly like this for me on the FC. I think Rx goes into Rx and Tx into tx. Should I try it again with changed pins?,Trace down the wires first Ok then swap them if u think they are wrong. Nothing will break. Just power the drone off Post another screenshot of this ports tab please
what is the best 2s plug?. and is switching to 2s worth it for a crux3 1s?,you can't really run 2s on it without changing the motor and AIO I'm pretty sure
"how much would it roughly cost? cuz i love the tiny size of it , but needs a bit more oumph with a runcam",idk off the top of my head
hmmm okay. what firmware is on the FC?,Just checking my sanity okay. get a screenshot of the OSD tab
Can someone help me with this? https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1236592164033794080,"You can use the goggles X with both a analog and HDZERO vrx but you have to buy them separately Need help. Drone crashed, now one of the motors runs when power supply is connected. and the drone isnt turned on. Drone manefacturer is TYH, model is TY-T2"
depends on the use case... as props? No. As a horizontal shrapnel launcher? Yes.,"I'm afraid that there's not a whole lot that can be fixed with these toy drones Hello everyone. I just brought a dji mini 3 but i had a little crash with it. I have those two little problems on the wings (photo) dou you think i have to replace it.  I've tried to fly with it without problems but i don't know if it was a good idea... I'll be honest, I didn't even notice anything at first... it's probably fine propellers that move air Well I still have no OSd"
can you post in the help forum on the Betaflight server?,"yes, it's a little damage but the shape of the wing changed a bit because of this scratch I regularly fly props in way worse shape on FPV drones, maybe that's a wrong perspective to look at this stuff from. if you want to be sure, you can always replace them"
"ok, tanks for advices. So you think it's ok even i fly the drone high or fast on open areas despite the wind ?","Best to watch YouTube reviews/comparisons for more details. yeah did that, i dont see differences. gopro actually worse in low light - but maybe there is something i am missing for fpv. most fpv pilots use gopro :thinking_face: I do, just because i found it cheap on fb marketplace yeah, you are right there  most used camera, most second hand ones :grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: id get a gopro, unless you specially need a lightweight camera then go for a insta360 go2/3.. dji actions aren't use to often yeah, so gopro 11 it will be i guess"
i have acquired a solder gun because want to SMD solder stuff... what else do i need... i got a bluetooth microscope and pincers.. do i need liquid flux?,it's not related to your digital VTX. the video transmitter tab is just for analog
Yeah on a JB video he said this is not needed for O3. Aight thanks. Well what else could be the reason for my OSD not working?,zombie motor had a burnt smell when power supply on. that's bad right
Is this piece important?,An electrical component falling off your ESC in every case isnt optimal...
does it really matter ?,"it's not *ideal*, but it's probably still gonna work"
So is there any way I can fix it?,"My osd is making me crazy soldering it on wouldnt be to hard id imagine Sure, if you don't want your drone suddenly start spinning out of control. The copper on it was removed still can be done if you expose the trace underneath, but in the process you might do more harm than good. And as vitroid said it might still work"
Can i attach gps like this ?. Or it won’t catch satellites. ?,f around and find out
"@HappyFishMan  What do you think?. I thought the pad on the left was broken, but when I took a photo of it, it looks good.",Might be worth to try reflow the solder to see if the copper falls off.. if your confident doing so I am confident in my soldering skills.
Okey i’ll try. Also will GPS also reduce the analog signal range?,unlikely. the vtx will probably effect the gps more than the gps affects the vtx
@HappyFishMan  Does the direction of this piece matter?,"i believe its a resistor, so no I think it is a capacitor"
@Vitroid Do you know if this has a polarity?,"ceramic caps shouldn't, no I was trying to test motors without frame. Suddenly all the motors started turning. and one of the motors hit the fc. I shouldn't make such a mistake again could've been worse, ive done that and had 1 motor rip all of its wires out. instant salvage"
Will the same thing happen if I turn on this setting?,"probably fine, and if it was to break along that line pretty sure the drone could still fly ill be it, a little shaky. you want the motors to spin when at zero throttle"
can a drone fly with only 3 motors ?,"well yes, but that drone no say your flying and cut throttle the motors will stop and the drone cant keep its oritation. Your basically disarming everytime your throttle is zero. its the same as turning air mode off"
can a meteor 75 frame carry 2 cameras using 22000kv motors?,so I shouldn't touch this setting not unless you need to for some reason thank you so much :red_heart:
can I ask one more question?,"I wasn't sure whether to shorten the motor cables during the assembly phase.. My frame is 5"" shorten them but give then plenty of slack. kinda like this An acquaintance of mine said that if I shorten them they will become unusable later thats looks so good :drooling_face: not mine, some random image i found on google does look nice tho. avoid doing this, your wire will be a lil short. (also not mine) I read that when done this way, the magnetic field created can affect the mosfets. Cant say, but i see alot of people do it that way so i cant be that bad Okay, so I decided to do like this.. thank you again have a nice day @HappyFishMan :cy_okk: Hi , I updated Firmware from bt 4.4 to 4.5 and now I'm getting processor overload (F4 Processor) what should i do"
What PID loop rate and DSHOT speed?,Problem i solved. Bt 4.5 changed Pid loop to 8khz Loop rate should be 4kHz Yep ik. Changed it. Also. Is it okey that my quad was drifting. And i increased. Damping to 1.1. It was 1.0 And now it isn’t drifting. Cuz it was drifting
I mean like it had prop-wash. Can i increase it a bit more ?. It has a lot smaller prop-wash. But still a bit it has. Can i do 1.2 ?,"Drifting and prop wash are two different things Damping reduce propwash. Nvm i mean propwash It's usually better to decrease the filtering delay than to add more D gain. Again, neither has anything to do with drifting I mean propwash. So what i should do to reduce propwash Reduce filtering. What is the build"
So what should i reduce ?. Can i have screen shoot ?. Of this,"Easiest way is to use one of the filtering presets in Betaflight So what preset is the best Make sure your build is mechanically sound, and try the ""normal build with RPM filtering"" preset. If everything seems good, motors are not warm, no weird noises, then try the clean build with RPM filtering preset But when i increased dumping from 1.0 to 1.1 the propwash reduced There are lots of videos on this Okey so I’ll check yt So, yes it can, electromagnetic fields affects *any* electronics circuits (if they aren't protected from it by various methods) but the magnetic field produce by our motor wires is far from being enough to actually disturb our electronics, after some quick math, (without taking into account that a magnetic field can add up) if our motor wires had 40A is passing through, assuming it's continuous current, I don't remember if there is any difference in the magnetic field from pulsing current, but you would have 0.008T, Wich is very low (((4π×10^−7)×40)÷(2π×0.001)) ((Permeability of free air*I)/2πd) And even if the equation is different for a pulsating current, it would still be way too low to affect the MOSFETs, I read a few papers in diagonal, and it would appear you would need several T (Tesla, the unit of the electromagnetic flux density) to actually disturb the function of a MOSFET   and I would instead think about the gyro than the MOSFETs, even if here too the effects should be insignificant at worse what are your ideas on the Axisflying Manta 3.6"" 6S DJI 03"
What sim should I get?,"iirc, it's kind of like a 5"" but in a smaller form factor. ||(But the best quad will always be on the diy side)||. But the manta should be pretty decent Velocidrone probably. Tryp or Liftoff maybe"
From what I hear velocidrone has better physics but liftoff has better graphics ui and stuff. ?,"Liftoff is frankly outdated. not a lot of updates, only ancient quads. and the graphics are meh Accept my friend request"
Emilia what you think ? Will tiny scratches on the GPS antenna affect its operation?,probably not. this is weird I offered him my steam login i was gonna dm him it but he doesnt want it. So he could try tryp
is bt3.0 best 2s connector?,it's the most convenient
will it be worth it to upgrade the crux3 elrs aio to a 2s aio?,I'd just build a different quad personally being 1s is a strength for that thing. can fly anywhere quietly
but i love the crux. hmmm then how else can i figure out the seisure that its having anytime i descend down with the runcam on it?,specific tune for when the runcam is on it i can show you exactly what i mean
oh is there a pre made one?,"diff = difference, only saves what's different from stock configuration. no clue dump saves everything. including stock I'd imagine. you wouldn't want to use that Why. I used it. For mistake because you only want the stuff that's different"
Something can happend if i used dump not diff ?,when you update betaflight some defaults might've changed. for the better
<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5833937> I imagine you've tried something like this?. I think so,yeah kinda i made a custom one. uses the stock runcam mount to attatch to the top loop try the anti-flex thing yeah or something similar its a fixed angle and is not detatchable. seems like the main issue is bc its so top heavy. bruuuuh. i see soo many naked rc thumb pro cases but they are all at fixed 25 degrees  i fly with my fpv cam almost straight horizontal
Not bad. Does it hold voltage?,Yea they are still holding and flying fine. I just didn't realize it took that bad of a hit in a crash yesterday
Then it’s probably fine. Do is the internal resistance similar to the other cells?,"just checked, its close to another of the same exact battery"
if i gut the runcam thumb will i need to apply anything to it or will it be fine if i slap a case on it?,I heard that runcam thumb is one hit one kill so better to play abit safer and slap a case on it i mean any coating and stuff. this is what imma get printed
btw how are you going to power it up ? 5v from FC ?,ok I got thumb pro but. i never use quality it not satifsing to me ;p I made a power cable to run from balancer but it kind of sucks
when its not mounted i tie the cable around the screw on top of the crux canope. what?,you can use a 5V BEC and plug it to the balancer of the battery
why do that when you can just use the fc?,because you can use a single cable for all your quads oh interesting hadnt considered it and also you do not need to tie the cable every single time. i run 2s and 4s so I soldered 2 balancer connectors onto the end of   BEC input. it will look funny if you use 2s to 6s thought :face_with_tongue: how does one solder jst connectors you don't. you crimp them. with a crimper
emilia. do i have to put any coating on a naked runcam thumb?,Might not be a bad idea to put some conformal coating on it
"to make a drone compatible with ELRS is pretty much the same i did once to make my drone compatible with a frsky controller, right?. just get a receiver and solder it?",yes. and some Betaflight setup cant find anywhere to buy from
You can’t find silicon conformal coating?. It’s literally every where. You could probably find it at Walmart,"why do u have a naked runcam thumb. makes sense. im stupi Just search up silicone conformal coating and pick one i did. nothing except buisiness stuff. save weight but its already ike the lightest cam there is good, i know you guys told me to forget about the wizard, but maybe i'll keep it to frankenstein the hell out of it haha more cuz its too heavy drone shakes like crazy with it on"
r u sure its because its heavy?,shiii idk. im taking suggestions
no. not as much atl. where do i go?,first tab in betaflight
why tf is it turning on its own in bf?,legit its rotating to the left ever so slightly bit by bit. its not moving irl. but yeah i have calibrated it in the past
any idea why during the night on my walksnail nano with avatar pro camera I see white noise in my goggles ? it looks to me like some noise from the 5V line but I am not sure thought,hm. im not sure tbh sorry
Will DJI RC work on liftoff?. Or do I need to buy som sorta radio master. Controller. Alr got a rc,You probably want one
Yo. Quick question. Are DJI drone mini refurbished any good?,Yea. They are. Get a mini 2 though. Not a 1 or a 1 se
Direct from dji referb or eBay referb?,"I was thinking of getting the Mini 3 pro refurbished Are they forth it. Won’t they damage easily l. And break They are worth it. Not really it is super hard to crash a camera drone but your name may be a prophecy Eh I’ve crashed mine plenty of times. It’s still kicking no issues Should I buy a new DJI drone or a refurbished one mine dropped out of the sky 2 weeks after I bought it because I didn't realize it would force land even if I had battery to clear the forest, so it went down slowly until it hit a tree and then it tumbled lol was  $12 repair. but as far as like actually flying it into things accidentally that's very hard to do if you're actually paying even 10% of attention. don't try to fly it like an fpv (saw someone come and say that before after they wrecked it) avoid trees etc. I got my air 3 best buy refurbed and it was like new. just the box itself was damaged. no battery cycles, packaging stickers were still on everything. felt like unboxing a new fly more combo for it"
Oooh. You have a drone business?,My used air 2 came with 20 cycles on all the batts air 3 is not a pro drone Was a steal of a price too. I would call it one it could be used for pro work but it's on the cheaper end of camera drones and doesn't have the tech of the actual professional camera drones. you could absolutely make money with an Air 3 and def an Air 2S. but really it's mostly for recreational users who want something a little nicer and don't care about weight.
shall I construct a pusher quadcopter? I have no prior experience to piloting drones,"A pusher doesn't have much advantages, they are slightly more stable, but otherwise they are more of an hassle to build since you need to keep the props from touching the ground, so you need a stand for it, or add feets so more weight and you can't use the battery has a built in stand because a bottom mount battery on a pusher quad will risk prop strikes and generally going kaboom, or flipping the quad over, or getting a frame made to be a pusher, so imo, it's not worth it unless you do a cinewhoop where the slightly better stability would be beneficial"
"Hey guys, i’m selling a DJI Spark Fly More combo for $375 aud. Is that a fair price considering its been used 5 times?","The only fair price is the one people are willing to pay, but since it was released in 2017, and it was 400€, I would say the equivalent of 230€ should be fair, you should put the price in USD tho, since the Australian dollar isn't really worth nearly has much has the American dollars (it would be 250$) it makes the price seem better even if it's the exact same also, #private-sales"
Hi there! DJI Mavic 3 Classic owner here in UK! Since its Classified as a C1 class drone do i need to gain any sort of license to fly it commercialy other that CAA registration ?  Thanks,"Thanks a lot mate:thumbs_up: (#drone-laws ) also - ""From the 31st December 2020, there is no longer a requirement to hold a permission or license to fly a drone for commercial use, however, you may still need a certificate or an authorisation from the CAA to fly your drone in congested areas."" (Blog.uavhub.com) So you should be good so long has you don't fly over groups of people"
Thank you. Are you from UK ?,"Ah ok, rules are probably similar. So from my understanding for commercial flight drone insturance is required i mean third party liability  insurance Well, my quote was about the UK rules. So you shouldn't be required to have an insurance either. But you should ask in #drone-laws about the insurance, I'm not sure about that one I need help with my motors When arming my quad the motors sound fine and stay decently warm without any smell. As soon as I do any pitch or roll inputs they start making a crackling noise Almost like something is grinding FPVUK.org registration covers you for small turnover commercial use IIRC."
Do bt2.0 connectors fit the a30 1s connector. (Pretty sure its called a30). The black 1s whoop connector. Can you spin your motors smooth by hand?,"YAes. I found what it is What motors are they and what battery are you using Its my new radio model Brand new zero flight F60. Yeah now I need to fix it. Might need @Vitroid the radio pro lol.. My old Boxer model works fine. Its my new one that I created to fix my AUX setup that fucks with it Im no expert on radios, i think vit is your best chance He has weird motor sound. He thinks its cause of his radio. I dont know if you remember me. But you helped me with my AUX setup on my Boxer"
Sorry?. I dont want to work with presets,"I have weird motor noise too after I crashed lmao My problem now is a different one why not. presets are awesome. elrs + supafly Not tryna be that guy but if u just wanna chat id love to buts lets do it in general nah I was just saying for fun My motors now make weird noise upon pitching and rolling us setting up a new model made the ELRS configuration back to defaults, which is 500Hz pakcet rate Its only on my new model tho you need to apply the ELRS 500Hz preset What could cause this. Whats that in Betaflight. it's a preset that has the necessary settings for the PID loop to work nicely with higher packet rates Plug quad in betaflight go to preset tab and look for 500 hz elrs preset"
But why do I not need that for my old Boxer model?. Im so confused,the old boxer model had different ELRS settings. likely a lower packet rate
Cant I change that manually on my Boxer?. Fixed it,"you can, but 500Hz is probably the best option. so I'd keep that and apply the appropriate preset My old one had 250hz and my new one had 1000hz. And the new one was the one to not work yeah. still though, I'd set it to 500Hz on the radio, and then apply the 500Hz preset in Betaflight Configurator. that will give you the best performance"
"Okay how do I do that on my Boxer?. I can only do 1000Hz or 250Hz via changing the ""Receiver 01"" option to O2","in the ELRS lua script you just set it to 500Hz yes. not D500 or F500. Just 500Hz Yes. It says -105db next to it tho get a photo, I can tell you what everything means Yes, it's both ways compatible, you just need to push bt2.0 batteries a bit harder in the a30 plug, but it holds them better, so it's hardly a negative imo, but if you don't like that, you can always file off a bit of the notch so they fit in more easily If it's on the radio it's simply the point at which you will failsafe. Also, bump up the power, 50mw is really low"
"To what?. I never touched any of these settings. I fly 5"" and I would gladly take your recommendations on to what I should set these to","You can see the dbm by adding rssi dbm on the osd, it's a measure of the power received by the Rx (it's in mw, but we use a logorithmic scale, the dbm, so we don't have to write 0.00001mw for exemple) and it gives you an idea of when to turn around and when you will failsafe, basically, if the minimum dbm is like -105dbm, then you don't ever want to get under like -100dbm. 500mw-1w I do have my RSSI on my OSD"
Is it showing numbers around 99 all the time ?,"No. it works. Currently on 70 something There is two different rssi. That tell different things. You have rssi, and rssi dbm. You want rssi dbm Yeah, it's much more reliable than rssi and lq"
And my Tlm Power for my receiver?,"Since you know the cutoff point and you can actually see how much the Rx is getting, but having both lq and rssi dbm is best (lq is a representation of the % of the packets that arrived, like, if you have 100hz and 90 packets arrived, you have lq 90) Basically the higher the output in mw, the better the range/penetration but the higher the ouyput in mw the quicker the battery of ur controller drains. For whoops i use like 50mw and for 5 inch like 100/250mw The telemetry power on the Rx should always be at maximum"
Cant go higher than 10 anyways. Also what should my Gyro refresh rate be?,"Its rather useful if you fly with dynamic power on the radio (Wich means the radio changes power dynamically using the telemetry to know rssi and lq so it adjust the power accordingly) or if you want to have other telemetry like gps, battery voltage etc that's not where you set it. just options for the graph On a boxer it's not has big of an issue, with a sizeable battery it already has amazing battery life I run a 4800mah 21700 pack, and it last for dozens of hours. I would say no. All my failsafes where with dynamic power Dynamic is good for most uses But people seem to like it I can only set dynamic to ""Dyn"" I personally run at 500hz 500mw locked. That's for dynamic"
Or wait should I set it to an AUX?,"If you want dynamic power It will pump up power as soon as I need it That's the point of dynamic power. It stays at 25mw, then when it needs to go higher it switch to 100mw etc"
Well what for example will drain more power and what not?,"Yeah im still rocking the terrible jumper t pro Fixed power will drain more power, but should be more reliable (at least that's what my experience gave me) dynamic power will give longer battery life since it stays at the lowest output power it needs. Well, at least you don't have a zorro with it's amazing 15min battery life at 25mw ||(it's exaggerated, but it has a rather crappy battery life)|| I see thanks. And what about the two different RSSI. I didnt quite get that I mean, they put some 18650 in the pockets but the zorro"
"RSSI I understand but the dB I dont quite get yet. And what about my receivers ""Init Rate""? @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)","You want rssi dbm, as that relates directly to what ELRS tells you Its set to F1000 -104dB It's a measure of the received power of the Rx Elrs tells you the minimum dbm for a given packet rate, next to the packet rate. If you use 500hz then put 500hz here. I already told him that So with my minimum being -105 I dont want to be below -105 You want to stay 5-10dBm above what elrs tells you is the minimum But -80 for example would be good -105dbm is a failsafe Based on how dangerously you like to live It's logorithmic so more like -97"
Stage 1 if that only happens for 1.5 seconds right?. So -97 is a normal range?. I see. I still need to set 500Hz via betaflight. No idea how I do that yet. (Manually). Without presets,"yeah but i have stick jitter at 250mw+, a screen with spots, gimbals i have to service eacht 3 months, the starting battery i need to replace every year. and the list goes on so with -105 I want to be between -95 to -100. I just like to do it manually at the moment for the sake of learning it all There's nothing to be learned from doing this manually yeah but elrs is magic so we use presets All that a preset does is to apply some CLI settings The -95 to -100 is just based on where you define your safety margin. If you do it yourself, you just copy and paste those same settings"
I see. Should this be on?,"This option sets whether BF sends some of its own telemetry data to the receiver, to be sent via its telemetry back to the radio.. You can get things like drone battery voltage on the radio with this"
I see. My db rssi is on -18 btw. Inside my goggles. Thats normal right?. @The GGManiack,Higher = better signal Great. Now I need 500hz on bf -18 is a lot of signal Now thats sweet to hear. But I mean my quad was next to my RF lol So it's perfectly normal Lovely. Thanks. Thanks a lot to you all. Just once again gained a lot of new knowledge You should be at like -70/-80 in normal flight Now I really only need to set 500Hz on BF. Will test that later today
"Presets tab, search ExpressLRS. Or ELRS?","Well that's the point of this server The presets have several sub-options which tune the responsiveness, so read carefully. Well tab does nothing"
"My bad. I read ""press tab"". yes. But cant I do that manually somehow?",I think you may be able to see the commands it will use I had an experience with a preset and it changed a lot of my settings. Had to redo them all Was a real pinch in the ass
What does it change?. I back that up like 3 times daily,"There's a save backup button in the top right of presets tab for a reason lol I cant remember sadly. Some flight preset. For freestyle I believe As I already said, I think you can see the commands somewhere in there, before saving them. I dont know what I thought was goinjg to happen.. It was my fault but yet it surprised me The preset primarily adjusts RC filtering settings. There is a rates option in there as well, but you should ignore that"
Do you have an iflight drone?,Lol now I'm lost on the context Then applying a BNF preset is kinda on you. Can't be upset at presets for messing it up when you used it incorrectly What. did you read flight as iflight or am I confused even more I assume it was a typo/autocorrect Iflight does have a bunch of BNF presets Well anyway. The elrs preset tunes the RC values so that BF knows how often the ELRS receiver will send it RC command and how much to average them by based on pilot preference (it gives you a set of choices in that regard). @Lock So the 500Hz preset changes not a single one of my settings
"Well... What do you consider ""your settings""?",Everything that has a button to switch or value to change. That I had to do by hand
On one of the Betaflight tabs. What exactly if I may ask?,You can look at the CLI source
"And btw what is ""AIR"" mode?","A pusher is just a puller with the motors upside down, nothing more. Any puller can become pusher by just putting the motors on the other side Yes, littel bit used but ok Is the esc plugged in all the way with all the pins correctly placed i will come again after i fully charge it It shouldn't matter so long has the battery isn't dead/wrong voltage yes i think, i dont have any shorts but i havent specify the pin yet in the software   No the battery isnt dead The pins need to match on the esc and fc sides. Or you might have bigger problems do you have any example of the right connection"
"I have a Radiomaster Zorro w/ built in ELRS, running EdgeTX. When I use it in sims via USB is it consuming extra power doing radio stuff? If so, is it possible to disable all radio transmission on a separate profile for sims to get more battery life?. And a little side-quest question lol, is it generally okay for the batteries to have the Zorro charging over USB-C while it's in use?","You can't use esc-configurator.com with it do you have any tutorial how to set up that Yeah it's fine. Just set it at 25mw, far quicker, and the power saving from turning it off compared to 25mw isn't that big anyway"
What happens if I charge LiPo 1s batteries to 4.35V?,"Okay this sent me down a little rabbithole. I've apparently been running 10mw this entire time for my Micro. That might explain why I had, not bad but not good, tx this whole time lol"
Battery connections good?,"Yeah, you want like 500mw fixed or dynamic from 25mw to max. 10mw is even less than what's used at races I had something similar where a slightly frayed ground/neg connection caused strange rebooting issues If it's a LiHV, then you will be using it like you should If it's a lipo, you are making a firebomb I am charging with whoopstor v3 and there is the preset 4.35V Awesome, I'll sort that out. It would work into my garden, but would almost failsafe at the far end. (small british garden) It's the batteries that matter If they are LiHV batteries then charge at 4.35. Give me the name of the battery. A Li-Po can be a Li-HV Well, ELRS at 500mw will let you go to the moon. It's a tattu folded cells battery, it's LiHV, you should charge them at 4.35v. But it has nothing to do with the drone shutting off mid flight. Make sure it has no wires running around or wires touching the frame or plug badly secured That sounds like fun! Not sure my analog vtx will manage, though lol Thanks for the help"
Everthing seems ok but it does that always at start. Do I have to wait for it to heat up the motors or something?,That's going to overheat the electronics
How much is too much?. Because I reached 85°,The board literally goes into a 200-300° oven to solder everything 50c is perfectly fine. It shouldn't go over like 70c Yeah it means you're in Acro mode with Air Mode enabled I think it was 85C. Where it says 50 on the screen I got 85 That's no good for the board. Might want to invest in a USB fan
Already have one and I am using it but still i cant fly my drone. It keeps saying telemtry lost. After I move throttle above half. Are these settings right?,get the tx power to like 250-500mw then put at 100mw. 50mw is too low
"Too low for what?. What kind of flying are you doing? What quad?. Set telemetry ratio to Std. And enable dynamic power. Do you have your arm switch set properly? Have you done a benchtest?. If you don't know the answer, it's not helpful to provide a wrong answer","well, for general flying 100mw will be better than 50mw"
"Better in what regard?. Most people would be fine with 10mW. Either way, the best solution is to enable dynamic power and let ELRS handle it. And what is ""general flying"" :Harold:","for penetration and range, even if it's only a 50% increase, and personally when I had my radio at 50mw I did have a few failsafes, so it would be beneficial to bump it up a bit Again, the correct solution is to use dynamic power, and benchtest before flying to confirm everything is working properly personally, I'm not a huge fan of dynamic power, the only failsafes I had outside of forgetting to set my radio from 25mw to 500mw, was on dynamic power (up to 1w), but I never had any issues by just locking my radio at 500mw"
your in the EU right?,yes. Like my drone reboots midair. directly at start
Sorry I am very new where can I find that?,"Same, So ik its illegal but when i fly inside or very far away from people i put my max Power on 200-500mW I cant even do that. Max is 100mW Connect to Betaflight, go to the CLI tab, type `status` and `dump`, then save the output to a file and upload it here i dont know if im allowed to say that here so just google Pocket FCC unlock"
I have a LBT. still possible?. doing it rn,Just flash the FCC/ISM firmware just google. yes. i wasnt going to say that bc idk if its allowed LBT is terrible for LQ because it has to check if the channel is clear before broadcasting Listen before talk is a pain in the ass Yes I would have bought the FCC version but someone said they could potentially stop it at the border. so I got LBT but I will flash FCC then
Did you flash Betaflight after you got this?,I dont think so. They were at the same version just dont exaggerate with the power
Is this a new BNF?. Take a clear photo of the FC,"Either you have the wrong BF target flashed, or you have the wrong config. Flight Controller"
"Yes, you have the wrong Betaflight target flashed. ~~It should be `CRAZYBEEF4DX`~~. https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2023/09/04/superx-hd-elrs-1-2s-aio-flight-controlelr-built-in-12a-esc-and-uart-elrs-receiver-for-digital-whoop/. Wait, what VTX do you have?","Ah, that's the analog ELRS+VTX FC You have the correct target"
but still the wrong Betaflight?,"No, that is correct also. The most likely problem is that your VTX power is too high and the board is overheating. Lower your VTX power, and enable low power disarm yeah board is overheating quick Copy and paste this into the CLI: ```set vtx_power = 4 set vtx_low_power_disarm = ON save``` Actually your PID loop rate is way too low also. ```set pid_process_denom = 1 save```. Do that also. Then let the FC cool before flying again. Don't leave the battery plugged in too long when stationary the problem is I keep crashing. so it is stationary most of the time. I quickly arm it but still Now that we enabled low power disarm the VTX power won't be high when you disarm. The FC will still get hot though. If you're not flying far you can lower VTX power further to 25mW. At least until you can stay in the air long enough to get active cooling And btw sometimes one of my props wont work at start. I only fly indoor for now only 5- 10m"
What is your battery getting down to?,"Probably a to low idle. Does they start moving if you yaw Looks like idle is set to 12%, which should be fine 12% isnt enought for my whoop to idle. Mobula 7 Depends on the ESC deadtime, PWM frequency, and motors. Try this: ```set dshot_idle_value = 1600 save``` sorry I was AFK. did this. I will try again after dinner. dont know Keep an eye on battery voltage in the OSD. Post some DVR if you have any more issues"
Looking for some foam recommendations for the goggles X. The stock one is good but puts a lot of pressure on my nose when it’s adjusted properly. Also do the Dji goggles 2 aftermarket foams fit on the walksnail goggles x?,"what I did personally (on some cobra x v2's) is I got some foam made for a vr headset (the vrcovers for the oculus quest2) and pluck it on, and it's the most comfortable foam I found so far"
Would this work? Like if I press AUX4 it should get into angle mode and if AUX4 isnt pressed then it should be in Acro mode?,"Arm must be on Aux1 for ELRS It is. But I mean angle mode But yes, if Aux4 is high you'll be in angle mode, if it's low you'll be in acro mode Sorry, thought it said Aux4 Why :expressionless_face: RadioMaster changed the screw on the TX16S No need to say sorry! I needed new screws and they changed the fuckin things @V-22 I just tried to fly it rn still the same thing happens after I try to throttle it automatically shuts down the motors"
What is your battery voltage at?,4.07V. It was 4.26V at start No but wait I will film it real quick
Yes. What is shown in the OSD?. This looks like it's disarming because board orientation is incorrect,Yes if I arm it it moves to the left. Like rotates to the left. Doesnt stay in place
i found a Eachine QX70 from when i first started flying - before i even bother does anyone know if i can update the firmware on it to the latest version of betaflight?. Micro SP RACING F3_EVO_Brushed,"https://youtu.be/H0wFSTdpIWM god it was a brushed drone The most recent Betaflight for F3 is 3.5.7, or Betaflight 4 Performance Edition. if it's brushed just use 3.5.7"
Is this setting necessary?,"I mean the internal RF Yes, those are the correct settings"
does it have a functional screen?,"then you can fully turn off the internal RF module Ok thanks! I try to find that option. i need someone who understands edge tx. i cant get aux 1 to register on my boxer's latching switch. and i looked at mixes and it wasnt there so i added it to CH15, but now aux 1 and 5 are both on my 2pos switch. also ive never been able to get the beeper to work on this quad so i just set the esc's to beep after a minute. if someone can help me resolve that id be happy aswell"
Best Price to performance 5.8Ghz antennas?,"no, in the model settings Create a new model called ""USB"", then set both internal and external RF to off found it! thank you both very much"
Hey. Its me again. Is there any way to do this manually now?,"You might not remember me but I set my radio to 500hz and I now need that for BF I stg people have just given up on reading or looking at anything I write these days. You replied to the last message in the chain which explains what you're now asking about @Lock *Posts 9 hours ago* You might not remember me... You take the CLI commands and execute them manually... I have no clue why you would want to do that, since that's what the Presets tab does (it executes the CLI commands which it shows you), but there ya go, you can do it.  Don't forget to send the save command afterwards. @Lock"
"so... no?. I wouldn't think so, but I remember hearing somewhere it might not be reccomended",That's a sneakily complicated question
Doesnt that present change my settings?,"yes, as we already explained I think that you're deeply confused about something I'm replacing the FC in my custom build I dont want it to touch any of the previously changed settings I did that's what presets ***do***"
how do i find out which rpm filter setting to use for my tune?,"Been learning betaflight for 3 days and Im proud of myself that I know most of it pretty well now Presets don't change EVERYTHING @Lock  Presets only change what they're made to change.  A preset may change one value or one hundred values. Depends on the preset. And I dont want it to change a single one uhh. you want it to change Thats why I need it manually so that it works properly I just want my hz to be acticated And you're confused about something again. the preset does the exact same thing as you would do manually. there is no difference How come the 500hz setting is one click on my radio but on BF its this complicated Because it's not the same thing ""there is no difference"" ""Its not the same thing"" if you read my messages in order, they make sense @Lock. if you read them out of order, they don't. easy as that And Im supposed to understand with you saying stuff like that :face_with_tears_of_joy: You would if you read them in order. 1: I just dont know why I cant simply type a command into BF that activates the 500hz I'd be going from 4.4.3 to 4.5.0 on the new board, I'm not sure what BF version the old FC was one, but I was planning on manually copying settings anyways @IceGoalie31 -Jank Tech Assistant The PID tuning and Filters are the issue. The rest is fine. ah. I was using stock before iirc Then it should be fine some settings may have changed names. But in general, the basic input/protocol settings hardly ever change hrm, actually I did have things changed that had to do with filters I think, but that was from switching to dshot32 (switched ESC firmware from bl-heli S to bluejay). whatever bardwell reccomended to change @Lock Already tried to explain ^ I see. Well its hard to understand as someone that only recently got familiar with these terms I'll just upgrade and double check here before changing any PID settings I guess. though I probably would either way since I have no idea how PID tuning works :grinning_face_with_sweat: all that Betaflight really sees is some packets being sent at some rate... it needs the correct settings to interpret and resolve those packets in a way that it doesn't mess with the PID loop Betaflight is not ELRS. Betaflight has no idea about ELRS.  It just has a receiver which is throwing RC commands at it.  In order for Betaflight to be able to properly process the incoming commands, its RC filtering needs to be set up correctly for the frequency at which it gets those commands.  Without this you may end with poor performance at best, melted components at worst.  There is also a lot of variability in those settings so that personal preferences can be considered.  Some people like more filtering (smoother but less responsive inputs), some like less filtering (snappy but possibly neurotic inputs)  @Lock Betaflight also ""needs"" to support a lot of protocols. So the settings have to be pretty general, or there would be an endless stream of single action buttons that do one specific thing for another specific thing aaaaand IDK what's happening here, nevermind I won't touch it, lol Betaflight's default RC filtering is about right for a 50-100Hz packet rate.  Very common for older systems.  It just about barely works with 250Hz, but it tends to heat motors.  At 500hz or 1000Hz it's crap, overheats motors, etc.   So you need to reconfigure it.   But, since you're a newbie, you have no actual clue what the values do, and frankly, to a smaller extent, neither do I.  The point is, the relevant developers have figured those settings out beforehand and made them into a preset, so that we don't have to.  We just select and click apply. @Lock"
Where did I say that you don't?,"Why 500hz if that burns my motors It burns motors if Betaflight expects 50hz. but gets 500Hz. that's why you have to configure it to expect 500Hz ELRS is a very new protocol in terms of the general age of the hobby. It supports speeds that were practically unheard of 2-3 years ago Honestly If you read the entire message, you wouldn't have written this question.. so please, read it properly. Ah, I am learning something here too, I was not aware this was something to adjust, I've been running ELRS at 250hz The more aligned your build is with what Betaflight defaults are configured for, the less of an issue it is I feel like Im not making the best progress. I need to set my Betaflight to 500Hz. No idea how we told you. about 10 times now I dont want to use presets sinse I dont want it to change any of my settings on my tabs. Not in my motors tab, not it my, receivers tab etc. :facepalm:. https://tenor.com/view/disappointed-face-palm-seriously-exasperated-gif-7304550 The presets INTENTIONALLY change the settings THEY ARE MEANT TO CHANGE Tahts one way to do it on a mature basis the settings which you don't know how to adjust"
so... you want to change Betaflight to 500Hz ... but you also don't want to change anything?,"I mean maybe its betaflights fault Because I'm worn out, I've had to explain the same things 20 different ways and you always return to ""I want to have my cake and eat it too"""
"What is this TPA thing? It's in the old FC's config, but not in the new one, I'm assuming it was moved or removed, should I worry about it at all?","Why dont they implement a simple Hz changing feature Because that's not how it works, at all That would stop people from picking entire presets which you would've understood if you bothered to read my messages. wdym ""entire presets"". the preset only changes like 5 settings on one tab. Which we've told you about a 100 times now"
On what tab an which ones?,"PID tab, the specific settings can be seen in the CLI source Primarily: Receiver tab. the RC smoothing things. it may change a bit about Feedforward in PID tuning tab. in some variants. which you could've figured out, had you looked at the ""Show CLI"" which I pointed at 10 hours ago today I did but I dont know what all that means And you don't know what RC smoothing and Feeforward mean even if you find them int he UI @Lock if you don't know what the CLI commands mean, you won't know what the graphic fields in the tab(s) mean either"
This is all commands right?,"for a variant of that preset, yes Imagine if you took your car to the mechanic You asked him to fix your radio, to be on the correct channel.  The mechanic tells you to click the channel change button.  And you tell him ""but I want to do it without the channel change button, because that would replace my whole car with another one"" @Lock Im still not entirely sure. What a weird comparison it's a very apt comparison exactly the point, that's the level of ridiculousness we've been dealing with this entire day look... multiple people told you multiple times over a spam of multiple hours that the preset is safe, that it will only change what it needs to, and that it will solve the issue with the motors. If you do not want to apply the preset, there's not much you or us can do about that I think it makes perfect sense for someone into this stuff for 3 days to not always understand everything right away you don't need to understand every single bloody command in the preset And we're telling you that it doesn't matter if you understand it or not, because someone else went ahead and understood it for you, and made a preset out of it.. You can understand it later, but with the preset you can fix it now. Don't forget that the preset has several sub-options which you should carefully look at. to suit your intended flight style. (it changes how much filtering is applied to the RC inputs)"
how will switching from bi blade to tri blade change flight characteristics will it help with propwash?,"https://tenor.com/view/peter-griffin-family-guy-perhaps-maybe-gif-16249623 cuz more prop less propwash. :PepeBigBrains: uhh. not exactly. You can end up with more or less propwash going either direction. because # of blades is not the only defining factor. also, more blades = larger area coverage = more propwash but, more blades = shallower angle = less airflow separation = less propwash then single blades for sure. less propwash What you're asking about is impossible to give a yesno answer to. I mean they exist"
prolly 1 blade. will this work?. nah fr tho,"there's a youtuber who would try to make this fly if you dared him hard enough the actual blades might There, my drone flies with oneblade"
"Analog, did you just get them?","They work with HDMI input as well. yeah you need to convert hdmi to hdmi. wait Thanks for not putting me in the screen cap. Deleting all evidence I was able to find a converter Uhhhh. I connected my esc to the fc. when I power it off a battery the FC gets really hot. really fast. like too hot to touch in ~15s. ah, one of my connections is bad it seems. I really hope nothing is broken. well I fixed the connection, still having problems stuff heats up without cooling. that’s why you should aim a fan on it so it has cooling"
Little while ago why?. So they could work with a walksnail system?,"try to fly it. If nothing is shorted and the smoke stopper does nothing. Just fly it and see how it goes Alright, I guess I'll stick everything together. I just wasn't sure if I wanted to do that, like if it's a defect I could still return it to pyro. If they have a hdmi in, then yes"
"do 3'' - 3,5'' inch drones use AIOs mostly? Theres not much options for stacks in 25,5*25,5mm dimensions in my country.",Depends entirely on what kind of frame. if you have a more brick-style frame you might as well not use an aio
"I'd like to build my own 3 - 3,5'' but dont really want to use an AIO.. So just look for a frame that can carry 30x30. ?","Yeah I think it kept increasing, that one part of the board was 40c when I checked. I guess it's probably fine oh i havent thought of going even smaller than 25x25. Thank you! Ill look into it"
Should I select dshot600? Betaflight defaulted to 300,"is 1500 6s too big for a 5 inch with 1950kv motors I turned on bi-directional dshot, and it gave me a filter warning thing, I just accepted whatever it said the default for bi-directional was"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  any of these good for the crux?,Depends on what chip is on your FC
I *think* you should leave it at 300?,"make sure you apply the elrs preset. for 250hz or 500hz Ok. I've got 250hz setup on the transmitter, so I guess I'll do that none of those look like standard 3.5"" props or whatever size your 1s crux is gotta attach said reciever first though its the crux3 tho not 35 only these fit What's the difference between ""freestyle"" and ""HD freestyle"" uhhhh...... I can't select any port to be the reciever. whenever I tell any to be serial Rx it resets after reboot. What do I do. oh hang on. I might be being dumb. Yeah, I was. fixed it, lol"
"I have a compas module. Each time I initiate it, it gives different offset values that needs to be calibrated.  Even if it's just a few minutes apart.  Why is it so?","Caught in prop on flight, arcs whenever i try to move it what do i do here Carefully separate the balance leads, tape them in electrical tape. Move it to a spot where it would be fine if it caught fire. just in case. just be *very* careful. I can't figure out the osd settings, I have walksnail 16:9 or whatever (the wide one) and with the digital setting everything is off to the right and down, it's not just it being smaller, the top left things are also moved from the corner"
I’m sorry there’s a lot idk but what hdmi connects into it from the digital system?,"Just get a mini hdmi cable and connect it to whatever hd vrx you buy there's a preset for this. I think it's wtfos walksnail or something. try applying it, there's a bit more to it than just setting it to hd Which would u recommend without breaking the bank Walksnail is the community fave I did apply it, but it made the OSD too small then. all the elements were too close together"
move them until they fit in?,"it looked like 4:3 I think. I couldn't move them further out in the preview. they were on the edges in the preview, but were sorta in the middle when actually run Like this https://caddxfpv.com/products/walksnail-avatar-vrx Damn shits way pricier than analog"
Do u happen to know what these antennas r good for?,"I bought this alll used like 2 years ago and am just starting to look at it. No clue what that means not gonna lie Eat One. Like a lollipop But yeah they should be just fine little lollipop antennas This hobby is too fucking hard lol Immersion rc is a fine brand I’m not built like u i guess and that's just the VRX Comes with a vtx and cam Ah didn't see that's the bundle. huh, they don't have it with moonlight camera Is new. Give them a little I re-applied the preset thingy. still doing that. oh. .... I had to adjust it in the goggles. ooook, well, everything seems to be working then"
Moonlight camera that much better?,"Allows 4k recording. your choice Well fuck I mean at that point I’ll like $350+ in on just the camera. Budgets not that big. The current kit might be the move ig. Is that comparable to attaching a GoPro. Quality wise I am not sure. all I know is that it's comparable to the O3, somewhat worse, some things are better"
"I can dangle the drone by the wires without them feeling like they will come off, that good enough?","do a tug test on the individual wires. and it's highly unlikely you're bad at soldering, that looks like it's entirely the fault of your gear brace em with a zip tie or two and it'll probably be fine. but a real pull test is better of course Good idea!. Will do tomorrow, thanks those are cold joints. which more than likely means they're not using a great iron or not using a good tip. and maybe bad solder"
Cause stannol is gourmet solder. Is it leaded tho ?,"I think it maxes at like 450c The ts101 is 60w iirc but *what is it*. what tip and what iron And I get fine results, the wattage is not the main characteristics of an iron I don't know it was gifted to me a couple years ago, it's worked fine sense then Don't tell me you soldered at 450c. Soldering is at like 350c I had it on 7 out of 10 so like 300ish I'm guessing it has a conical tip so it can't transfer the heat to the big esc pads properly, hence the cold joints and high temperature. I have a few tips for it. I used one of the flat ones for the esc. Bevel tip I'm pretty sure it's the solder because r/FPV is saying the same thing so I'll try to pick up some better quality stuff tomorrow morning Get some stannol 63/37 leaded solder. If it's unleaded and 60/40 then it's just the solder's fault That's what I have. Apparently just not very good brand I mean I have 63-37 solder* Bad choice of words on my end I'll try to find some You do not want the ecological lead free garbage Great, let's poison the planet for better joints I used to use silver solder because I had a crap load of it for some reason but I didn't want to use it for this because it's in those thiccc wires Try to get something from MG Chemicals, Kester or Stannol.

"i have a 4 inch drone with 2850kv motors 1604, I have been using 6s to fly it, but can I use 4s to fly too?. longer flight times with li ion, less power","Yes, but has you said you will have lower power"
after flashing from blheli to bluejay do i need to save settings or just leave them ?. alsowhere to change in esc configurator the motor startup power ?. Should i change to minimum 1100 and Maximum 1200 ?,https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1236579448309022730 please help with connecting RXSR to FC without a telemetry port
"I have a kit drone with an extremely complicated calibration process. If I plug it into betaflight, can I change this? Or should I switch out a component","update, did another pull test and i felt like i was more likely to full the esc off the stack then to pulll the wires off of it Also yeah fuck the FAA for what they’ve done to drones. It’s both But the company wants me to use it I think it sells for $200 but the company bought it not me"
company? to learn how drones work?,"To test tracking devices for the army and Air Force on drones. Yes damn that's quite some money Yeah it’s a big investment. Expensive piece of equipment. Lol yeah I don't like it ahaha. if I look at it.. It’s not my favorite but I need to get it off the ground but I'm wishing u the best, and goodluck By any means possible. Unlimited budget"
so what can it do so far? stand up and go on?,Flash lights. I can’t for the life of me figure out how to calibrate it. There’s zero instruction online basically it being on lmao
Yup. So should I just swap out the receiver and fc for something new?,"can't help you on that, don't think bf will work with it either"
Yeah. So should I just replace the components that are being annoying?,"I would just get something new :skull_and_crossbones: Company wants that one. I have an unlimited budget. We can do ship of Theseus. It just needs to get off the damn ground I mean. I think everything could be replaced outside the frame, motors and props Yup. And escs. So that’s what I’ll do then ig. Just swap everything"
"By default my crux35's betaflight says the motors are reversed, should I leave it like that or set it to the default way ?","Can i solder the antenna for the elrs receiver basically. Before u buy the new components tho, send it in #shopping-advice and ping me I just broke one of mine. And the other is on its last legs which reciever would be helpful Radio master elrs rp4 true diversity (a pic would be helpful too btw). I guess you can just leave it as is"
just replace that antenna w a new one?,Is it not worth soldering. Ill probably just get a new one to ensure that it is more durable than soldering. And tape it instead of zip tie
What's your dshot at?. and what software is on the esc?,I'm not sure what to give so i'll give all. It seems the error rate is stuck at 0 now for some reason (I disconnected and reconnected) :man_facepalming: :Harold:
"i'm not sure how to properly attach my propellers to my crux35, I think I got the orientation right but i'm not sure about the screw/bolt setup, can anyone help ?","Yes I think, they look like that picture. with center hole and two holes for screws yup. just get the supplied screws. align the hole with the prop. and screw them in making sure the screws aren't too long"
I think I personally didn't choose any fine-tuning. the rest speaks for itself no?,Serial External RX. Since I have an external receiver
okay thanks a lot. Do I need to press real hard for the propellers to go on the shaft ?. It seems a very tight fit,"My drone is too powerful for me I thought you weren't here :DIWhy:. sorry. I'm not going to be anymore. :Harold: Fly in a bigger space or set a throttle limit There is no problem when going fast Become better. And the problem will solve itself But I can't control the drone when it slows down for landing. Actually I can control it but I was afraid Personally (controversial opinion time) I don't recommend a throttle output limit since once you are good with a quad with a 70% throttle limit and you let it go to 100% then it's like flying a whole new quad and you have to start again sims and flying weekly will do the job I can fly in the simulation without any problems. The fear subsides as you gain experience I didn't fly in a few months and when I put my 5"" on the ground I felt like it was going to jump at me, even if I had almost a year of flying before. But it goes away pretty fast then you're scared to crash irl Start with basic flight, learn to control the throttle, then you can more effectively do flippy flops"
What frame do you have ?,"was me aswell, just fly, take it slow, and improve from there You should be able to bash it without too much issues (even if 5.5"" is a bit of an odd size)"
"If I switch to 4s instead of 6s, will the reactions slow down? ?","Yes, but that's still like learning to walk with a pair of crutches diatone mamba stack :OOF:. just fly man, don't look for ways to make ur quad slower. Take it slow yourself and build up. crashing is part of it, and will happen nothing to be scared for, as everything can get replaced and repaired no, I like it very much personally and use them in my quads myself The latest revisions haven't been great value, quite expensive. But still solid hardware. I use them as well"
What do you think of the rest of the build?,I have one more question
Only one? :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:,"There is a clicking noise from the motors when the drone rotates yes they are expensive, thats true, but I don't have any issues with it and I like that a lot You might need to be a little more specific and/or provide a video or recording"
"I'm shooting a video right away. battery is about to be charged. Also, is there a way to adjust the vtx power from the remote control?. @DædalusFPV",there's plastic touching your motor
Is it just a sound or can you feel it vibrating more. And is the noise the same without the motors screwed in. Is the noise just when yawing?,only rattles during roll pitch and yaw. No sound even on throttle max
are there even 3blade props that are 1.5mm holes that are just preasure mounted?,"Since you use diatone, would you recommend the mambo mk4 f405, it's to put on a lr quad so the esc will only have to supply like 10A max but I need the hardware to be really reliable Also, I'm searching for a new freestyle fc, and I was wondering, in terms of bulletproof-ness if I should go with the hobbywing xrotor f7 convertible or something like a diatone one, all I need it to do is not break and be 30x30, and that's about it, and if it can be relatively cheap (like around 50€) it would be a plus but not a necessity I have a bias toward diatone honestly, but all I need it to do is only to not break when I have a meetup with a rock for the 16th time Diatone has a good reputation IMO, as does Hobbywing Well, hobbywing has basically the most durable esc, so that's why I considered their fc A fc is an fc, they aren't really differentiated based on use case, other than what you may or may not need for UARTs. So it's not like there's one that's good for LR and one that's good for freestyle--they are doing the same job I know, all I care about is how durable they are When I arm my crux 35, it immidiately tilts forward and hits the ground quite violently with it's props, is that normal (i'm in angle mode) You can't go wrong with either option IMO"
Hobbywing and diatone ?,Put it in acro mode and see if it does the same thing. Calibrate your accelerometer on a surface that is actually level.. Ye
"Ok, let's say, hypothetically, you *had* to choose one for your freestyle quad, Wich one would you get ?",yes it also does hit the ground in acro
is emax nanohawk valid?,"Not sure if it helps you, but I have had a few hard crashes flying straight into grass, mud, stone and a few metal poles aswell, with most of them being 6-20G's, and my Diatone stack is still working like brand new.. Nah Cause you can get much better Ok, well, all my fc fried because the voltage regulators died and took the board with it, even without much on them, so I don't actually know if it had anything to do with the crash 25mW vtx, GNB battery connector, overpriced and FrSky I believe. All of which are horrible Even if I do crash pretty hard (I obliterated multiple 6mm arms)"
"What are you looking for (flying indoors/outdoors,...) and what's your budget?. Must not be all too cheap, I'm wondering how you did kill those voltage regulators. And also, from which brand are those FC's?","Gnb connector doesn't have to be bad, I'm fairly certain it's the gnb27, but if it was the a30 it wouldn't actually pose any issues Full throttle vs concrete lmao, looks like a damn big hit Was on a tree, not concrete It's indeed the gnb27, could be that I'm messing some things up in my head aswell but all other things I mentioned are bad ab it. Tree has same effect) T motor velox cine f722 (~80€), a GEPRC span f722 (~80€ too) so they aren't cheap fc by any means, Wich is why I don't want to buy more expensive fcs I wanna fly indoors and outdoors with like roughly 80 bucks:folded_hands::folded_hands: You might be able to get a second hand mobula 6 2024 for this price with a bit of luck/patience I understand, €80 down the drain is quite a lot. Go for Diatone and I'm happy to hear your opinions once you do kill it aswell :face_with_tears_of_joy: I'll try looking for one on facebook marketplace A Mobula6/7 ELRS (not 4in1) would be ideal, and as said, you might find them that price second hand. Also, you need a radio aswell as fpv goggles then. But I'm not so sure between diatone and hobbywing honestly, since they are both the exact same price, the only real difference is that the diatone has an f435 but I don't give a crap about that I assume you only have 1 FC per drone, so that's why I said €80, but total is indeed double Yeah, if you don't have the goggles radio and batteries you won't be able to actually get into fpv with 80$. It was on the same drone. In a period of 3 month. Which is why I'm sad What frame is it, it looks good For $80 you're basically going for a toy drone. It *looks* good lmao It's a Kurt R from lethal conception It does have something Sure, it doesn't look bad, but it's not a good frame at all. The little plates between the arms, potato chips. The arms, potato chips, they broke in like 2 hard crash, my mark5 with 6mm arms has well has 6month of getting beat up and crashed into trees, rocks etc wayy too hard and still has *no* signs of damage. The motor protections don't even protect the motors. There is no space inside, even for a racing frame. And it's 98g. Also, nobody who races actually uses anything other than a stubby. Or use DJI at all. Or a walksnail antenna"
I knocked the cap off my O3 antenna. Can I fly like this? (Shrinkwrapped in the antenna for protection). The signal seems to be good,"True yeah. Great to see its basically shit yeah no this frame is really bad, don't buy it. also, I don't know if I missed a step somewhere, but the resonance wasn't exactly great. it would appear the active ellement is still intact, I would recommend quickly getting a new antenna because that one won't take much of a beating anymore Yes the new antenna will arrive next week."
flyfish or the dji one ?. and do you have the v2 goggles or the g2 ?,"The dji standard, the flyfish stubby seems out of stock everywhere They call it a stubby themselves :slightly_smiling_face: https://www.flyfish-rc.com/products/volador-ii-5-6-inch-o3-stubby-antenna-mount"
A those. Are they any different from the stock dji?,"they are basically the same thing but might be more durable. personally I only recommand the truerc matchstick cause it's litterally bullet proof, but I don't believe it's available in a dual band version or a linear, even if a dual band is just an rhcp element and an lhcp  element squashed together, but I don't know if just getting an rhcp and lhcp antenna would have the same effect"
"Can a damaged antenna fry the vtx? Like if I fly with shrinkwrapped O3 antenna, could it damage the O3 unit?","If the radiating element is undamaged, then the antenna itself will perform as expected, and should not result in damage to other components. Heatshrink alone will not protect the antenna though, they're wrapped in a plastic casing and filled with foam or other material for durability the outer shell can basically be considered decorative when it comes to antenna performance dvr would be handy honestly"
Can someone help me here https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1237454531651174512 ?,"Im trying to cionnect my caddx peanut to betaflight and i have soldered the power cable to 5v, GND, and TX4.

"Hey everyone, quick question. I haven't flow my Flywoo Explorer 03 for a couple months, and will start flying again soon. Are there any updates I should do before I fly or just liftoff with the original?","Lbt is worse. Fcc is what you want Lbt is the eu and is locked to 25mw, fcc doesn't have an output limit. You could flash betaflight 4.5, the gps support is significantly better on 4.5"
What's the deal I've been hearing about a possible ban in dji drones and products?,"The issue with DJI is that they sent everything back to the CCP, and the USA doesn't like that very much Yea but that's like all Chinese businesses I thought lol I mean, not really. some just do it more than others"
"Does the amperage rating of a 4 in 1 ESC refer to each esc? or the total max? (e.g. a 55 amp esc, does it support 55 amps total, or 55 amps per esc?). I would guess it's per esc. but that means an insane amount of power","wow. So with 6s at 25v that'd be up to 5,500 watts. That's a lot of power yeah but it's not that simple"
I'm assuming that's burst?. and you have to take sag into account too,The ESC is not the issue really in that regard
the C rating of the battery?,"battery voltage sag and motor electromagnetic shenanigans Guess you'd need ~ a 2.2 amp hour 100c rating battery. and I mean even with a sag from 25v to 23v, that's still 5,060 watts and keep in mind that the ESC is only rated for that when very well cooled every time I see people encase ESCs within layers of plastic I go like :Harold: I wonder if they sell heatsinks for my ESC. the newer speedybee ones all have metal heatsinks some ESCs come with heatsinks preinstalled. yeah. but the airflow is the bigger issue the max I've seen my drone draw was ~2000 watts, which is still crazy. welp, that's cool. https://tenor.com/view/the-more-you-know-gif-26317296 to clarify the motor shenanigans: as the motor spins faster, it starts to oppose power that's applied to it. back emf or sum shiz. I don't know the exact details of it, but it makes the power drop more steeply with rising RPMs I have only very surface level knowledge of it so idk. I just know that the motor will pull the most power at lower RPM if you give it a lot of load"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force. ah. it sorta acts like an inductor?,"well, a motor is a bunch of inductors ""thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor"" with the issue being that while we're trying to use that inductance to turn the motor, the motor is trying to use that inductance to move electrons backwards against our effort ""That is, the back-EMF is also due to inductance and Faraday's law, but occurs even when the motor current is not changing, and arises from the geometric considerations of an armature spinning in a magnetic field."". something something electronics big brain stuff. cool haha. it just means that the power graphs aren't straight. or straightforward"
"How can I tell if prop pitch is too high? I'm assuming it'll mean hotter motors right?. I got some j40s after vitroid recommended them, so I'm not super worried, but just in case","If the motor smokes than it was too much, but also, the Juicy40 are great props used by a lot of people, so I highly doubt you will have any issues with them drawing too much power"
"4"" pitch? no probelmo","Yea you'll draw more amps, and the quad will actually react more slowly because it'll take more torque to accelerate the prop on quick moves"
Will it be a noticeable difference?. Ohhhh I get why racing props have a small pitch now,"Lower pitch takes less torque, but also spins at faster rpm, so you actually can get more airspeed, at the cost of reduced overall thrust"
So if you want to go faster you want a lower pitch?,"I think everyone would notice, but you have to know what you're looking for to tell what it is In just a straight line. I mean Generally yes, in a flat out run. There is a lower-bound though, you still need enough static thrust to overcome your airframe drag"
"Ah, ok, so the J40s would actually make my drone slower?. But they would be good if I wanted to carry things maybe?. Or for a bigger battery?. (running 3.7"" pitch atm)","All of those things, IMO. Like we always say though, props are cheap Ah. Guess I'll try some of my lower pitch props then"
can the tx16s 4in1 talk to a DSMX rx?. oh shit nvm i broke the anteanna off. guess that answers that,for some reason I cannot flash my fc. keep ssaying initiating reboot to bootloader. then it disconnects the fc
Ie. is it still safe to dumb the 4.4 cli dump from flywoo in the 4.5 formware? I assume not but I dont know how else to do it,"its better to put a diff from 4.4 to 4.5, it should still be ok to just dump it into the new FW tho"
"sorry could you explain more? bit confused on what you mean. ok i got the gyro and accel to show up, but the accel is way off on its tru orientation","not to what I've seen so far. I have a 512GB card in it because that's all I had and it works fine I was thinking about getting like a pack of 128gb cards, since I seem to be missing microsd cards whenever I need them"
"The props are correct for the picture. The question is whether they actually turn in that direction. If you take the props off (very important!) you can spin the motors on the bench to ensure they actually spin like the diagram says. Should've hit reply. In the receiver tab in betaflight, there is a telemetry toggle on the right, is that on?","thanks, I prayed the gods I wouldn't have to remove the propellers i just put on :PepeSadge: You will have to if you want to bench test motor direction. Better get used to changing props anyway :KEKw:"
How do you remove t mount propellers ? It took a lot of force to push them in but pulling the out seems even sketchier,"Undo your fasteners, hold the motor by the bell and pull whilst twisting them back and forth. That's generally easiest I find. Some props are on tighter than others I must have the tightest on the planet. Having to pull hard on the blades feels very wrong. Read online about bent shafts, now twice as scared I've just flashed v4.5 to my fc and for some reason my receiver binds but it doesn't show within betaflight. I can't move the sticks but shows as connected"
can I use two 1s batteries to make a 2s battery?,"Try and pull as close to the hub as you can. Doubt you'll bend the shaft like that.. Yes, people do. Just make sure you know what you're doing and don't short anything"
"Is it configured correctly under ports? Sounds like the receiver is binding, but not communciating correctly with the fc","I've been pulling and twistin for 20 minutes and it travelled < 1 mm Hi. I need help fast. Is this good Bloody hell, never had them that tight"
"Ah it's a prebuilt. Not sure, worth a check if your quad is misbehaving. I'd expect it to be correct from factory as long as you haven't changed motor directions inadvertently in firmware. That'll probably be ok then. Eeeuuh, some pretty random parts there. The antennas will only work with DJI goggles. The vtx transmitter is analog. That transmitter is ???","Well I did pretty much everything else on that list https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146. so i'm quite confused now Definitely worth checking the motor directions. Soz. https://oscarliang.com/fpv-drone-guide/#Parts-and-Equipment You probably want to do some more research before spending a bunch of money Thanks for all, enough hurting my fingers for the moment i'll take a break"
is the VTX build in those tinywhoop FCs?. do they also have esc?,"Depends. You have some like the Betafpv F4 5A 1S that is only the fc, receiver and the esc. You have others like the SuperX that has the fc esc receiver and vtx built in. But you also have some that don't have neither a vtx nor a receiver (usually not used in whoops). So read the product description so get an aio with all the features you want it to have. Because an aio only means it has the fc and esc on the same board"
"So what drone are we talking about??. Also, props are on or off?","an fpv drone, props off Ohh that's normal. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144568652809654272  Read this, there's ur answer. You won't have this problem in acro, as ur motors will just spin at idle rpm when arming. ""an fpv drone"" is still very unspecific"
Should have told me that since the beginning. Man doesn't even have a radio lmao. Powering up the motors is just spinning the props slightly left right and making noise?,nah thats ragular. *e. the startup beeps and the slight spins are all good but then after like 10 secconds it starts beeping and spinning the motors and the gyro fades
Send a video of it. Would be helpful. What receiver do you have in it?,elrs dont remember exact name I can find it tho if needed. gimme a min gonna take the video it doesnt fit here so Im gonna send a link. https://files.fm/f/3457xv5gyt
The soldering job looks..... It could improve. Do you have goggles or not?,yes. i have the dji o1 goggles and radiomaster pocket radio
Ohh so you do have a radio. Is it binded?,no its not. the drone starts doing this before the reciever even enters the binding mode. but I have flown with this drone before this started when I switched the vtx from analog to dji. and I switched the elrs reciever cause I crashed and broke the one before that
yes your right. for some reason after flashing it reset the config not sure why. thanks. also can someone explain what this means. i dont have a blackbox so i cant tune my quad but im trying out the supafly preset tune in bf4.5 and they say to do this. not sure what they all mean. also its giving me a warning after applying?,"Looks like ESC settings Demag is for when your motor and esc get out of sync, causing a motor stall and a death roll. This is to compensate and recover from it. I believe"
thanks what about timing 23 degrees?,"As far as i know, it affects the torque, rpm and temperature of the motors. Ramp up is to control how fast a motor spins up to reduce sudden current spikes. And i think pwm 36khz is the refresh rate"
mines set to 50% should i alter this as mentioned to 30?. higher is better?. stock is showing 24,"Idk, i left mine stock. Which idk what mine is should i touch esc at all or should the bf only suffice. i dont want to plug it in and have it fly away Bf only. Change esc if you need to"
so a change in bf does not need to be complimented in esc necessarily?,"Not necessarily. I dont touch my esc unless i have a problem, like desync i see thank you for the explanation. also one more question. OSD seems to have dissapeared. never mind it was turned off"
"Sup, i want to get my first fpv drone but there are so many options. I really dunno where to start. I prob want to build my first drone but i dont know if i should make a part list myself or get a part kit. Every esc and every component is different right? So some ytb drone building tutorial is worthless to me if i dont have the same parts right? Sry if im asking the wrong questions or if im asking in a wrong channel. if some1 could recommend me a place/guide to start that would be nice. Ty!","There's a firmware requirement, but yes, AFAIK https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1139714290882969631 a firmware requirement, thank you"
"is it a rush vtx ?. nvm layout seems to be off. Do you have another picture, brand or anything that could identify it ?","What is the pinout for this kind of Vtx. I want to know the 5v, Gnd, video its pandarc vtx, nvm, its dead dead. that's what pandarc stuff does best"
Goggles 2 or Goggles V2?. I know V2 has the digidapter. But I don't think G2 even takes HDMI input,"No. V2 yes, G2/Integra no"
Oh it might be the v2 yeah. Is it a good set of goggles? I might buy em,"Ask here. You probably need to set up your radio Not until i bathed my quad with seawater :PepeFeelsBadman: . I wanted to extract some chips from it. My TS805s died because of a broken antenna cable DJI is phasing it out for their modern stuff, it is the last DJI goggle that has inputs and outputs and easy antenna replacements and such As long as it can run the air unit and analog at the same time im fine with it. Thanks for the help I'd consider Walksnail, but yeah the v2 can do that perfectly Im kinda on a budget, as i am new to Fpv, so i think an analog and digital mix for only around 250-300 is a great starter. I think walksnail is pretty expensive Walksnail is downright affordable the goggles X are more expensive then some of the DJI goggles the cheapo dji goggles can't do analog and stuff though. and the v2 are being poofed slowly. kind of the way DJI is trying to get us into their system What could be the issue when i dont see any stickmovement in betaflight. Receiver is an FrSky XM, sbus. Sometimes it looks like this, sometimes everything is 0 First of all: if you just got FrSky, consider returning it and getting ExpressLRS.  otherwise, check if your ports tab and receiver tab is set up correctly and make sure your receiver is bound and powered"
"I am working with pretty old things here, i want to reboot my hobby. :grinning_squinting_face:. is sbus still a thing in 2024?","the FC's and stuff support it yeah. but for the rest everyone has moved on to ExpressLRS, can't really get better than something that literally anyone can go and improve and is cheap"
Is ELRS a FrSky replacement or a new protocol or something?,"It's a new protocol based on newer tech. It's open source and every company can produce hardware for it Here is a dump, if anyone is willing to help. :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: This suggests to me that the FC and RX are not communicating properly"

i am not sure but the gyro is misconfigured so I assume a CLI dump would apply settings that came from the manufacturere ?,Yes so it would be helpful to know exactly which drone and/or FC you have mamba stack mk f722 mini I just have a save to file button
"Did you build this drone? If so, there is no CLI dump. If it's a pre-build, then the manufacturer would have uploaded a CLI dump",I build the drone yes

"Could you screenshot the ports tab, check if your wiring is proper and check if SBUS needs to be inverted or not?",Wiring should be correct

So this is not the issue?,"im getting super bad motor oscillations and its messing up my tune. This doesn't reflect in flight either. oh wait. its just a really bad pid tune. just @ me if anyone has a solution Two things.

idk is it bad?. thats my first drone,"I'm trying to figure out what you changed to make it not work :grinning_face_with_sweat:. and also trying to make sure if I have the right settings i changed few setting in ports but none of them work Go to Presets tab (Szablony)  in the top right corner, there should be a Save Backup button. save the backup and post it here"
ok so. where are all of the settings :grinning_face_with_sweat:. Did you click Reset Settings or something?,"mayby , was trying to update elrs. bc it was not compatible with tx download this backup. and use the Load Backup button in Presets tab to apply it ik. still not working. mayby i bind it wrong"
Uart 1 jest nadal na MSP ?,".... look, I can speak Polish too, to some extent, but this is an English channel. the backup should've done that. it should now be UART1 = Serial RX"
"I mean is it saying it right now. On your radio, open the ExpressLRS menu. and post a photo of it. I want to see the very top and the very bottom. Curious, it really is connected.. At the top, where it says RM Zorro, does it ever say Model Mismatch?","btw, if you intend to run LBT, you must update to a newer ELRS.  There is a bug in LBT in the version that you've got."
sometimes is stuck on loading. elrs version?,makes it a bit unreliable. yeah i need to update only radio or drone aswell
"both. latest stable is 3.3.2. but that's for later. it's not the cause of the current issue. so, just a sanity check When you move the sticks on the radio, you get no inputs in Receiver tab in BF Configurator?  please re-check @᲼᲼᲼",exactly. every setting stay in one position
is it set to CRSF on the right side?,"Okay so, because BetaFPV is sometimes very annoying, let's verify one thing Go to Ports tab and swap how UART1 and UART2 are configured. and save. and re-check Receiver tab"
Could it be that he hasn't got any profiles in the radio with the joysticks configured ?,"Yeah, wanted to get to that after one more check. just want to verify everything drone side first. Okay, undo it. Mixes page is what matters I created new profile eariel. That's the settings This is the wrong page yeah. show Model Setup, Internal/External RF. that's radio setup. I want to verify Model Setup. MDL button"
"ok that's fine. so, back to my first idea. 1) did you undo the Ports tab changes?. should be UART1 = Serial RX, UART2 = VTX. 2) do you know how to get the receiver into WiFi mode and how to connect to it?","i reflashed backup again, yes. yes i updated it via wifi okay put the receiver in wifi mode, connect to its wifi and send screenshots. I want to see:  Top of the page the main page (idk the name) Model page. that's the transmitter. I want to see Receiver :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Sys > ExpressELRS > Wifi Connectivity > Enable RX Wifi or turn off transmitter, power cycle drone and wait for 1 minute If you have set up ur home network it should connect to it, otherwise it will it's own AP I cant access the model page This happens when it's not properly connected to the wifi. Either it's fighting with another connection, or it's too far and dropping signal"
"Does ELRS have ""FC passthrough"" ?",not sure what you mean In the sense that you could configure it via USB connecting the cable only to the FC Betaflight's serial passthrough works for any UART device. but that's irrelevant for the options which we need to look at
should I get the meteor 75 or the 75 pro frame?,"ye, that was out of curiosity"
"The receiver can be flashed through Serial Passthrough In that case, the Flash Erase option could be used to fully wipe any settings the receiver may have @tanker199099. and the Options page?","meteor 75 is the meteor 65 pro in larger frame I need to see its contents properly. HUH. the baud rate is very very odd. this is not what it should be on a receiver. should be 420 000. so change it and save ITS WORKING. thank you so much okay, now you should update everything to 3.3.2 xD so that LBT is reliable. if you want to be the 6th person who uses it i was strugling with it 2 days now glad I could help. found the 7th user of LBT :face_with_open_mouth: (Too lazy to flash FCC) It's a running gag in the ELRS dev circle xD. so much effort to implement LBT only to find that 90% of people just run FCC anyway xD I mean, in my experience police doesn't really care that much about the protocol u are using, they mainly care about what are you flying for and how much the drone weights it only really comes into question if you've f*d up in other ways already. so that they can tack on more charges. EXCEPT FOR GERMANY. fly LBT there. apparently they like to check that kinda shit there. @᲼᲼᲼ If you need help with updating, ask away Im in Spain currently, been flyin in my town with 5inch quads, asked the police several times about regulations and I am still to have issues. (I will get them it's a matter of time with my luck) inb4 ""polish citizen found to be spying on a military base in spain with illegal fpv drone"" I was going to take a trip to poland a couple of days ago, specifically made a drone for it, did not end up going cuz I received a call for military service like 3 times thank you:folded_hands::folded_hands:"
"guys, are VTXs supposed to be expensive?","I saw an ovx300 for 40 bucks Expensive is subjective. A good analog vtx like a tbs unify pro hv32 is like 50€ Is it better to just change my receivers or get a transmitter module Receiver. Must cheaper Unless its not already elrs If your transmitter is frsky and the receiver is ELRS than get an elrs transmitter I got a radiomaster recently and didn’t know it couldn’t run frsky access. Which is what my drones are on. To elaborate Only use elrs. Throw frsky in the trash Burn them in a dumpster. Oh, well that's great. Just replace the part of your setup that isn't ELRS to elrs So new transmitters :loudly_crying_face:. Oh well. No big loss. My self built will be easy. But I have a tinyhawk 2 It's worth it. Elrs is basically a magical link with infinite range and near 0 latency Classic frSky confusion. I swear they hate their customers How do they have 2.5 different random protocols out concurrently Because the person they have managing their software roadmap is an idiot. Or maybe nonexistent. I can't decide which Glad it’s not just me tho. I was always confused with them"
Not sure WHO suggested me the elrs reciver Ep1 but when i solder it then i plug usb port into the frsky board and just flash it with elrs or how it Works?,I've had a nasty crash recently. Now whenever I arm the quad it starts to climb without my input. Backbox viewer shows my motors are all over the place when armed on the bench. I just want to know whether I need to buy a new ESC/stack/motors  https://gyazo.com/ae504335eb079addefe779eff6239219
I ll explain it so you undertand i have drone that is frsky and i bough happymodel Ep1 and then i ll solder it onto it then the drone shoud be able to recive signals from elrs radio but how shoud i bind  it? Thru usb (plug usb micro or usb c not sure rn to frsky reciever) and then bind it thru betaflight,"To my knowledge, an ELRS receiver (Ep1) needs an ELRS radio, if you have both, there is 2 ways to bind it, by default it enters bind mode or you can go to the receiver tab in betaflight and press bind, then just bind it, the other one is the passphrase, which consists of flashing the newest elrs firmware with a key to both receiver and radio."
Ye i have boxer elrs and then Ep1. So I just press bind on radio and on PC. And plug that usb into frsky reciever ye?,Usb c or usb micro not sure rn
to connect it to a PC ?,Usb c or usb micro (drone) usb to computer. Just any Regular data cable :D I am its pretty stupid to ask because i dont have any other option to plug it in. Ye ye ik :D Micro USB is not round
I seen some guy plug it into the drone 3 Times. Shoud i do that?,Yes but i told you that because i dont know what port has the drone. Cable into drone
But u only have to look at the connection. what drone is it ?,"@dogesTV | mobula 7 I would strongly recommend to do the bind phrase process Btw gnd to gnd, vcc to 5v+,tx into rx and rx into tx It's a lot less annoying The drone uses MicroUSB"
Oh oke. So plug it into then into PC and bind it?. That is it?,"First plug it, we gonna guide you trough the process Well the receiver will need to be powered one way or another"
Nah its find ik how to bind if it makes issue i ll ask :). https://youtu.be/gYglB9Ie30E?si=Uw3Fvihcvpy0C8UY. Shoud i do this. Plug it 3 Times?,"not really, it automatically enters bind mode"
Last thing is this right?,"As I already said, it's probably best to use a bind phrase. Yes just went out and flew a pack. the second pack. i lost video about 50ft out Okey that is thanks both of you :) not gradual, just instant blackout. got my quad. found my linear dipole antenna looking like this. the little line part completley off. im suspicious it isnt the antenna though. if i broke an antenna would video just cut off like that. at least this gives me an excuse to upgrade from the dipole It would break instantly Without an antenna you will still have video, but the range wont be more than 10-20meters yeah. i flew about 1 second before it just cut off yeah. but i was worried bc it just cut off I got less than 5 meters when I lost my antenna would the video just cut off"
How long was it on for?,"depends on how long it was without the antenna Possibly but hard to say order the new antenna if it works great, if not u have to also buy a new vtx. either way the antenna upgrade is needed im cooked:loudly_crying_face:. yeah. i had 2 foxeer lollipops. they ejected both on day one. never to be seen again it's a Darwin baby ape right baby ape 2. the 3.5in 4s ye, the vtx it's not that expensive on those. nvm. It is quite expensive yeah if i was to get a new vtc. id prolly upgrade. get like a 20x20 800mw Rush tank mini. :chefkiss: was about to say that yep. thats exactly what i was thinking. if i cant find enough money then maybe hglrc zeus. but hopefully il have enough cash for a tank mini. rush vtxs are just so peak I am just waiting for banggood to get it in stock as it is really cheap"
"Hey, does anyone bought or thought of buying used batteries? any pros/cons? should I?. I'm thinking of buying 2 6S batteries, 1300mAh.

Betaflight. Does the CC3D run it?. I can't remember,"Once upon a time, Betaflight did support F1 boards. ~~Support dropped in like 2017.~~ Looks like the last version to support F1 was 3.2.5, Feb 2018 Is anyone here have apt experaince with frame design to help me hello there, I was wondering, especially durability wise, what would be a good hd camera for a 5"" quad"
(I do the same dw). Have you tried the sologood vtx though ?,"pfff hmmm. you don't exactly know what the seller did with those batteries. If he's selling them for $8 each, maybe. Otherwise you should just buy new ones. @tanker199099 check out 1W sologood vtx Ye I got flammed for even mentioning it haha well i also believe zeus is more quality hardware, but for sure ill try to buy the cheapest components because my drone flying is not yet professional yea seems super good, but havent done extensive testing yet. i dont think its useful to flame about chinese stuff  and quality, they produce it cheap then one has to know how to deal with the weakness of the stuff and know where it is equivalent and where good quality is not optional. just the problem is that the market is intransparent in another way than our own I mean in case of the sologood vtx it looks like the Zeus one, but overclocked to 1w i didnt run it on 1W yet only to 400mw yet could you try running it a 1W and makin a range test, I'd really like to know what range it gets at 1W it depends on other factors like weather and antennas and cooling. one would have to compare them in a real good setup to measure the output power correctly but i suppose someone must have done it already most likely ends up being just noise that even your 100 dollar receiver struggles with until you end up with a fake that doesn't even come with diversity I think mine is original, anyway to check it well seems I was wrong. Still not a huge deal, cuz diversity does seem to work"
"if it was eachine wouldnt they write it in the description?. sometimes its not a fake but just a ""copy""","Depends on how do you define fake well like faking functionality^^. for example i got a tiny action camera for 10 bucks that looked like an insta360 but just destroyed any sd card i put into it In terms of functionality and specs it is the same. like even same weight most of the electronics in the world is produced in china. they have control over it, wether the west likes it or not, at any moment they can put another logo on the production They actually do the opposite, the remove the original logo while selling the same product For example, if you look up arduino nano, you won't find a legit nano, but they will work as a nano"
does anyone know if there is a difference between regular carbon and glossy carbon? They both cost the same so I was curious. does one weigh more?,"As far as im aware, is purley looks. Gloss just has a clear coat. Which yes is heavier but probably not a noticeable amount Gloss would have a epoxy top/clear-coat applied to it. I would expect it to be slightly heavier, but we're talking about very minute amounts. Carbon fiber plate is already composited with epoxy as the binder, so an epoxy top-coat is easy to do at the end of the process But are qe talking more than or less than a gram. Really why it so :glowing_star: I want paint-ready frames yup. got to make your drones pretty. otherwise what's the point"
what do you paint with. just spray them?. can you send a sample?. might be worth painting over gloss,"Sand them underwater with automotive paper so it doesn't instantly flake off. then you just spray them. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1223813972898353234/1227769388464083024 ye it looks pretty unique. ill give that a go when it arrives I used Tamiya polycarbonate paint. works fine, it's chipping around the screw holes and stuff. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1223813972898353234/1224456920082157810"
only around where I tightened screws. I know that some people don't do any prep work so that it chips easier. It'd probably survive the rain?. maybe not being thrown in a pool,"It might chip less if you use a primer, especially if you use a normal spray paint like the Rustoleum you can get at a hardware store, but I don't know that for a fact"
Will this antenna work with a radio that comes with a dipole antenna?,"Yes, it will work well with any radio that has a linear polarized antenna, which a dipole happens to be. A Moxon antenna is also linearly polarized. Ah I see. Thank you very much Btw, that's also a dipole Ohh. I thought it wasn't one since it wasn't T shaped Dipole only emplies it has 2 poles, the shape doesn't matter. I could do a round dipole if I want to"
"Evening all, just done a Maiden flight of this 7 inch I been building.   It flys so I can't really complain. Just 1 thing I've noticed. There is a whistling noise/ rattle from the motors?. I've checked and no screws are even close to the motors. Also nothing has accidently attached to the magnets. Is this a tune issue? I used the uav 7 inch preset.","Hey guys so I was flying my lil whoop and after a couple crashes and coming back like normal I plugged in my next battery and I was getting no osd other than the beta flight startup. Tried going into the menu but nothing. Also not able to arm it. Was able to connect it to betaflight no issues gyro works fine it’s moving, but when I go to the receiver tab and turn my radio on and start moving stuff nothing happens. Also in the modes when configuring it like before and I move the switches nothing happens. Tried with another whoop and everything works fine so ik it’s not the radio. Fc is the f4 1s 5a with the mo3 vtx. Ik in liftoff you can go into the community built drones and find a lot of different kinds I haven’t looked for cinewhoops since that’s never caught my eye but I bet there should be some. If not ik other will recommend velocidrone Any, just select a 3"" cinewhoop Can't view OSD through goggles using analog vtx and the format is stuck on HD and I can't select anything else"
Can i use locTite on Plastic Strews?,I think it made my screw very brittle o yea. dont do tat. lmao. im dumb. loctite destroys plastics thats unfortunate. i. put. it. on. ALL. of my plaisc screws oopsie daisys. yea. dont yea dont use plastic screws :P the thing is i have to mount my vista in my pavo 20 and it came with plastic nuts a. you dont need to loctite tose usually. teyre a bit undersized so tey form around te screw dang. superglue. or teflon tape lol yea was being sarcastic. use some teflon tape id say WAIT. i think i have some nuts. (i hope there called nuts in english) yes. oterwise yea nyloc nuts. same as te ones you use on prop nuts but smaller YES. i have some that are a little bit longer and metal. and i can loctite them
Do you guys know of any python librarys that communicate with fpv radios through usb cable?,Connect either my frsky taranis or my betafpv literadio 2 se for a project im working on in python yes but connect to do what
To get the inputs? Joystick mainly,It just acts like any HID device. so just search any hid library
What's cip? I got the smart audio wire from the vtx going to TX3 and setup in ports tab and I got my vtx table setup correctly and when I go to OSD to setup my display I can't take the format off HD and nothing I put on the screen will show up in my goggles,my keyboard. teres anoter letter tere. after te c. wat fc do you ave Huh idk. It's a tmotorf7 22 v1.1. I didn't know OSD chips were a thing I just  assummed all fcs had them man i cant wit tis keyboard. not te (letter im missing)D versions of FCs This is an older FC I happened on for this build too. Not the HD version o yea were did you solder your camera to. is it attaced to your FC or your VTX. wait o. no. dw. god my internet is also dying Can is solder to the FC You have way too much exposed wire
Does anyone know if flywoo explorer l4 frame comes in two sizes ? One for analog and one for hd ? I bought walksnail moonlight but i seem not be able to mount it :unamused_face:,"yes, theres the normal frame kit and the O3 frame kit. oh it looks like theres a walksnail variant too"
Does the regular tmotorf7 support osd?,yes. it as camera pads
"@carrot after some thought. i have decided im sold on walksnail. most likely the walksnail moonlight as I honestly think the o3 is shit in low light. my question is, do you need to buy an sd card?. does it come with one?. hot damn. https://youtu.be/uukuZO0KA6I?si=LJnW69htFyEDy2Pp. now the big question is what goggles do i get",Goggles X of course. pyrodrone has them in stock if you're in the US. You probably need to buy an sd card but like. a 512gb one is probably only like 40 bucks
What does it mean that a fpv camera is switchable? I haven't found a way to switch mine and it's killing me trying to fly it in 16:9 with 4:3 goggle everything on the edges are squish together and I can't judge distance,I'm guessing it has a way to enter a camera settings menu. there should be a remote or you can wire it up to your fc Yeah I did that and there was no setting for aspect ratio just contrast and brightness and things of that nature
which mode should I arm on ?,"ballsy like that ig, off now. You should arm&fly in accro. Angle mode will try to keep the quad at 0° from the ground, so if it's tilted it will try to make the quad flat again. Even if it means moving the quad a bit while on the ground I don't get it, my stock crux35 rotates when armed (in acro) and then dips enough for a prop to hit the ground. I had already sent a https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1237705762093137981 message to check my props were on correctly and apparently they were, so i'm very confused as to what could be wrong.  I guess by some weird reason an individual motor rotation could be wrong but that seems unlikely since it's straight off the factory, and also I can't test motor direction anymore because these props won't come off no matter how hard I try.. :PepeShrug:"
"Man that sucks, they really shouldn't be on so tight. Have you tried shimming something under them and leveraging them off? Nuclear option is to take some sidecutters and just cut the.plastic on the props. Props are cheap anyway.","if they aren't on so tight they fly away I tried with some thin scissors and another prop I had lying around, but without success, I guess i'll have to cut but I hate being wasteful. They also have screw holes so no they don't really He's got t-mount and undid the fasteners take the props off and go in betaflight to check the motor directions. make each motor spin to see if it spins in the right direction. well, you just need to grip the motor bell and pull/twist the prop off I would do that if I could get them off the motor shafts yeah. it's hard to apply much of a twisting force when the motor bells are so smooth and small also well that's how you do it. may it be on some 0702 or some 2004. and you really shouldn't try to jam the prop upward cause you might bend the shaft doing that. and motors are more expensive than  props Yeah, as I understand it their props are properly stuck on there. I don't even know how I would cut them out, and I'd have to buy the tools probably"
you have an exacto knife/scalpel/utility knife/angle cutter/snips ?,Or do you know someone who does physical labour and has serious hand strength but you should really just try harder with the prop. and do not  try to grip the motor with plyers. you might end up bending the motor bell and that will just enduce a lot of vibrations. which will considerably degrade the flight performance
"ok thanks for all the tips i'll try to figure it out. just as a general thing, reversing the motor direction should only mean that you have to reverse how the props are mounted for it to fly right ?",yeah. *if the motors are already spinning in the right direction but for now check that all motors are spinning in the right direction and that all the motor pads are good
can you send a photo ? I am not sure what you are talking about here,"there is something betwdeen the frame and the motor. something like that That's the motor pads (at the end of the pencil) I see, the soldering points. mine have little connectors and they all seem alright Yeah those are a rather old concept where people tried to put basically tpu gummies under the motors to attenuate the vibrations of the motors. so, now go here. and launch the wizard (after taking the props off). you probably don't want a hole in your ceiling Now I'm trying to figure out if it's motor or esc. After i pick it up it goes normal, 1007 throttle in betaflight. don't just let it spin like that, and swap this motor with a motor you know works and you will have your answer Don't got spares lmao you have 4 motors on your quad. just swap two Gotta invest in a solder iron then I guess you *need* a soldering iron for fpv Yea just been trying to figure out my best option. Price to performance, and something that'll do what I need ts101, and some stannol solder(63/37 leaded)&flux Is pinecil v2 close, I've seen the 2 of them compared. they are pretty much has good. I prefer the ts100/101 tho The only thing is I'm in Canada. Major pain In the ass getting anything tbh take which ever is in stock I think thats what i bought, highly recommend it A long drive or a couple days shipping... if you get a real one yeah maybe i got a real one haha i hope and it's not the best goggles ever, but at least the price/performance is good"
"ofc they aren't the best goggles, but they are worth the price. Also the main reason I came here to ask; my cam signal cable always disconnects from the cam and its really bad if I crash and the camera wont work :fearful_face:  any ideas how to make the cable stay?","solder it on better. and use a stress relief zip tie No no. i mean the cable that connects to the cam itself, with the plastic header. my solders are good use a stress relief zip tie. or solder the camera to the board if it really keeps on getting  out that's not what a ts101 looks like Clone then I'm assuming. This right @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)"
don't you have access to some fpv shops ?. and yeah it looks more like it,I wish. Closest is an hour drive. And it hardly has anything *internet*. there has to be some fpv shops in the internet 2 week minimum shipping :slightly_smiling_face:. Plus duties for import and border stops 90% of stuff. Royal pain in the ass to get in the air my friend
yeah I see this. do you live close to the usa border ?,"10 minute drive. No passport tho oh. cause you could have just asked them to send the package to a usa postal office and get it there Ive done it before. Not a bad idea. Its just I need to get someone to pick it up for me it will let you use pyrodrone, rdq etc I got all the props off my drone, but now i'm wondering how the betaflight motor direction wizard works, the motors all spin but i'm not sure about direction or what i'm supposed to be looking for"
what esc should i get for a 3.5 in. wait should i get an AIO?. this good? https://www.getfpv.com/geprc-taker-aio-f411-fc-12a-2-4s-esc-built-in-elrs-2-4ghz.html,"That’s how you blow up components. Dw, stick some foam under it :slightly_smiling_face::thumbs_up: well, for exemple, you take the motor on the bottom right, it should be rotating clockwise. the bottom left counter clock wise. the top left clockwise. and the top right counter clockwise I can't tell what way they are rotating though. it's too fast you just put your finger on top and you let ir get dragged by the motor and see in wich direction it goes. always softmount everything sounds dangerous but perhaps its not it's not if the props are off. that's how I do it on all my motors just don't push your finger into the motor. if the motor has some sharp bits at the top use the motor bell instead. @Sigma before you cut your finger off no. iirc you wanted a 6s quad. and that's for 4s max. plus the amperage is too low. I would recommend something like the axiflying argus f7 aio"
did you break the connector or is it just angled ?,"the camera went through alot.. at first it was 21mm wide and it was too late to request a refund so i just sanded the sides off. it works great but i need some way to get it together without it disconnecting. i didn't sand close to the connector, just the connector gets angled because of the threads I think  the angled connector is the issue here might be. but works great. it doesn't disconnect often but when it does its just interrupting I guess, use hot glue on the connector, and it should work. personnally I would just solder the cables directly to the camera and fc, but you might not want to do that"
solder the cam itself to the fc? thats kinda weird. but might be a good idea,"ill try the hot glue method, no reason for it to not work tho its sketchy. if it wont work then ill move on soldering the cam itself. thanks! yeah but you can remove the hot glue if you decide to solder on the camera after yeah. everything is sketchy in first fpv drone build :Harold: im blind dude lol how i didnt see the 4s in there is beyond me. btw do u guys reccomend GetFpv. com also it will blow up when you will try a 100% throttle. look at pyrodrone and rdq before is it cheaper or more reliable. im assuming yal dont fw rotorriot they are just better stores, that ship faster and are more reliable. it's more of a political grape so to say than because the shop is bad. it's just what they turned into, compared to the original idea of rotorriot, isn't great. basically, check pyrodrone and rdq first. (if you are in the usa) i live in perfect area tbh. many fpv stores physically near me. right near chicago. shippings quick asf tho so i dont need to worry well, I am not even sure there are any physical fpv shop in france at all"
really? Id think paris or marsaille would have something,"not sure, but there certainly isn't any physical ones in the alps. but we have dfr, an online shop that's really really good, so it's fine"
"btw i just gotta ask, is paris dirty?. wait. i pasted wrong thing",it depends if you want to have motors spinning or not https://www.getfpv.com/axisflying-argus-f7-aio-f722-fc-40a-3-6s-blheli-s-esc-25x25.html that's the aio I talked about meant to paste that theres another version thats even more pink. not my favorite color but i dont really care. nvm its the same thing just a super saturated image

Easy to spot when you crash paris isn't that bad if you stay in the nice area i want to make it my favorite colors, orange, gray and green. maybe even maroon. props got me covered tho and ill spray paint frame there are the hlm and stuff like that, but if you cut them out of your peripheral vision paris is great And then you take one wrong turn, and suddenly rubbish, homeless people and graffiti everywhere I know, it was sarcasm, I hate paris, there's a reason why I live in a tiny village in the mountains away from civilisation"
how do i know what power level my TBS UNIFY PRO32 HV (MMCX) has?. cus i just downloaded the tables and set powerlevel there. and i dont know if its true or not. like my last vtx,by connecting it with smart audio and configurating it in betaflight
vtx buggin in this case. is this right or wrong setup?,"idk, if you don't show us where the vtx is wired on the fc Vtx side. Camera side for the vtx you should have something like that"
Is tbs smart audio on uart 1 OK?,so smartaudio vtx should be seleted on uart1 Yes. And it's showing this tho. False. .. It's not ready I have no idea what it says tho. I don't speak german typ = type. and device aint ready. as it shows
aymeric you said these tattu batteries were good right https://www.amazon.com/TATTU-Battery-650mAh-Torrent-Lizard/dp/B071GBGBB4/ref=asc_df_B071GBGBB4/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693127141871&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14606779608377097513&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9018795&hvtargid=pla-559825712812&psc=1&mcid=0697d48ff9f63eca9d5b06dee2a9bca8&gad_source=1,yes but i cant change freq per betaflight i know i was just pasting the brand i havnt looked at any battery yet yeah tattu is good. just be sure you get the R-Line v5 batteries if you go with tattu
https://www.getfpv.com/tattu-r-line-version-5-0-1200mah-6s1p-150c-lipo-battery.html this?,"that's too big for a 3.5"" ohh. what mah should it be dam the price dropped alot. cool. wrong one. thats 4. https://www.racedayquads.com/products/tattu-r-line-version-1-0-22-2v-6s-650mah-lipo-micro-battery-xt30 yeah. if you want to save some money (without hurting performance much) get gnb or cnhl instead im in a fine spot with money . Now i believe i need flight controller, headset goggles, and my actual controller sure, but batteries are consumables, might has well spend less on them so you can get a better radio and goggles since you will keep those for way longer"
what are these pink prints near the motors? ive seen them many times but still didnt understand what are those,"the socks are here to protect the arms since it's there you crash usually, so you don't scuff the frame and it also protects the motors a bit more don't really need one for freetyle it's a siren f3 split https://www.getfpv.com/iflight-blitz-stack-f7-v1-2-fc-e55-4-in-1-55a-esc.html  think i got me fc oh more reasonable for the weight i saw in the picture you can build an ummagawd 2fiddy to be sub250 without much trouble. eh. get diatone or hobbywing xrotor"
"hello, i would like to start in fpv, i would like to fly cinematic so latency is not my priority, my priority would be the range, so i think that the best option is digital, is there any good option to start with digital but not spending a lot of monay? the video quality is not a prioryti either because i have already a goPro. I thinked on a caddx vista or something like that but i dont know,  any advices??(sorry for my horrible english)","if you want maximum bulletproof ness I would recommend this one https://www.getfpv.com/hobbywing-xrotor-micro-combo-stack-f7-fc-40a-4-in-1-blheli-32-esc.html. well, the cheapest option for digital will be walksnail. but if the only thing you want is range you can always get a 5/10w analog vtx and have enought range to go to the moon is it possible for me to go for the fat shark scout or is that silly"
"dou you mean that with analog i could do ""mid/long range?""(i know that as a beginner is nor recomendable to do long range but i dont want to buy two air unit)","don't get anything fatshark. everything can do anything, just  more or less well, and a high powered analog vtx has fantastic range how important is a really expensive pair of goggles expensive analog  goggles is stupid. expensive digital goggles make more sense hello my flight controler from my sub250 tinywhoop 16 is broken is there a cheaper place to get a replacement then from sub250 themselves because it costs 90 bucks and otherwise i rather put that money in a new drone"
i dont really wanna spend 500-600 dollars on the goggles. do u reccomend anything for me under that margin?,"for analog, get the skyzone cobra x v2 The flight controller of a whoop makes up the majority of the price get an x12, but whoops aios are around this price"
i have walksnail. analog is different then walksnail obviously right?,"is it the same size as the other one well then you can get the goggles X or some second hand dominators (the pointy ones). all whoop aios are 25x25 well that shows how much of a noob i am XD thank you tho and the goggles x are the cheapest new digital goggles at like 450$ iirc. yeah. analog is analog, walksnail is digital. tho on the goggles x you can use an analog receiver with the av input, and most analog goggles with an hdmi input can use the walksnail vrx. (tho there are some exceptions like the cobra x v2 that has 32ms of latency on the hdmi in, so it's not suitable  for that). well, I mean technically, I did see some 20x20 and 16x16  whoops. but that was a long while ago does this look good ( no gogs yet Well this one looks bigger then 25x25 well, except the zorro  and the fact that you have 2 stacks (the aio and the stack are basically the same thing) and the tattu r line 650mah 6s (you could get more batteries by going with gnb or cnhl, and more batteries means more time in the air, especially when 1 pack is only like 5-6min). it's from screw hole-screw  hole. you are measuring the entire pcb here. 25x25 is just the mounting pattern but do you mean from inner screw hole too iner screw hole. this is the sub250 fc and esc thing yeah. it's not about the outer dimensions okey then thanks dude"
ya this obviously isnt what im gonna buy on august 28th since im not educated quite yet but wait fr? i technically dont need a fc? i was wondering why this past persons list didnt include an fc. itd be nice if the image loaded,"the argus is an aio, so it has the fc and esc on one board. the xrotor is a stack, so it has an fc and an esc on two seperate boards. that's analog, not  walksnail. and the gemfan is 3.6"" wich might cause issues. and if you want to go analog, get a rush tank solo instead https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/rushfpv-tank-solo-58ghz-vtx-w-smart-audio-mmcx-7602.html. and I would recommend a ratel 2 instead of the cat 3 even if the cat 3 isn't bad"
"what is ""not a lot of money""?","Hey, I wanted to ask if Nazgul Evoque V2 is compatible with DJI Googles 3 & RC 3 iirc the g3 are not compatible with the o3. yeah, they aren't yeah, dji hates their customers I mean DJI could just release an update that makes it possible And they really focused on getting the damn C1 label and not focused on satisfacrtion of customers dji doesn't  give two craps about the fpv community My father bought the dji avata 2 for him and me because we both are beginners but after like 2h of flight sim i can already fly really good. and I want more power haha *which is exactly why I pass all my time saying fuck dji & the avata* what prebuild drone would u buy or would u wait for the o4 air unit for sale the best 5"" prebuilt imo is the geprc mk5. but going diy will pretty much always be better is there really not a cheaper option I am not that confident to build one myself yet. how fast is that baby I mean, there is, but they will break or have qc issues. put some r35 props on, and it will go basically has fast has you want. I mean, it's legos for adults really mhm well then i guess i have too buy a good one but i think for the price difference i will buy the original one instead of a 15 bucks cheaper one even though it might be good tho the motors won't be happy with the props you will need to go at 200+ kmh ima get some huge ass fines because of my country if i get caught haha the x12 is most likely far better than the sub250 one. eh, we all fly some 650g quads at 120km/h while blasting several laws everytime, and nobody actually gets fined. when someone gets fined it's like with philly drone life because you bassically did all the dumbest shit you possibly could I think ill go with the dji avata 2 for starters because we already bought it and after a year or so (when I am confident that this is a new hobby for me) ill tryna make a diy fpv drone yeah, it's probably the best course of action since you already got the avata 2. tho, real fpv quads are a lot more fun, a lot more powerfull, and can do a lot more may i ask why because i am pretty much a newbie so i am curious less qc issues, better built, and will probably last longer overhaul. I rarely see people having any issues with the x12. and mine has been through a *lot* before breaking the only issue i have is that i have no idea if all conections fit and how to properly conect everything well, all you have to connect is the camera and motors. the motors just use the motor plugs, and every aio will accept a camera my camera has gnd 5v and video but what do i connect video too the video in or out. may i ask why it eventualy broke then"
Avatar Goggles X  will work with Hdzero vtx/camera right?,No. Not without an hdzero video receiver module
"don't i need to solder a little wire for 2,4g because my sub250 board had that?","Cause I draw 30A from a single esc The x12 has a built in cube antenna thank you but where do i connect my camera video too too the video in or out Video in. Video out is to output to a discrete vtx i don't need that right because there is already that little clip on antena Yeah that's just the antenna, you need to connect it to a vtx regardless. Vtx Which is built in on the x12 so i only need the x12 and i should be good too go again If you still have working motor/camera and frame than yeah"
same thing if i wanna try analog right?,If you want to use analog on the goggles X you will also need a discrete analog receiver
"if i buy this https://www.getfpv.com/lumenier-axii-2-5-8ghz-antenna-rhcp-2-pcs.html?cmid=eHZ3Y2tBWGYrQWM9&ats=TDVqcklibFhpSVk9 Do i get 2 antennas with rhcp, or just one lhcp connector and one rhcp. Rhcp = No hole inside connector, LHCP = With hole in connector",thats not my list. thats someone elses. i was using that as an example since i was wondering why there wasnt fc listed. now i realize AIO is a 2 in 1! You get 2 rhcp. Aio means all in one also sory extra images got sent im glitching right now
can you bend SMA antennas to face a specific way?,heres the list. ill get different batteries btw If it has a flexible coax then yeah. You need props. A charger
btw is this one good?,Very. It's basically has good has it gets for a patch
what charger do i need? does it plug to the AIO,"Hota d6 pro. It's to charge the batteries, doesn't do anything with the aio. Also, if the batteries have an xt30 you will need an xt30 to xt60 massive brainfart. duh I'd really really consider getting the Boxer I was gonna get to this part, the boxer is better in every single way yeah i meant to say batteries lol It's more than likely more comfy and it's the same size, uses proper batteries and has a newer tx and such Bigger gimbals, more battery life, more output power, perfect ergonomics etc"
boxer as in controller?,"Also, the stock gimbals of the boxer are way way better. Rather obviously yes"
What kv are those motors?,"i own the zorro already. leme double check I have this build. > Grinderino 3.5"" frame, Axisflying (what a bad name) F7 pink AIO, Walksnail V2 Pro kit, RCINPOWER GTS V3 1804 2450KV motors"
Why is the Argus f7 a bad name ?,"what huh u basically have the same build as mine. i think ima change the frame Oh, well it doesn't sound bad, when you think about it it's not the smartest name ever, but it's fine. The grinderino is awesome. And you want 2900kv stay grinderino. actually my build is different im trippin the axisflying aio isn't easy to solder whatsoever by the way. and I'd recommend you get the new flower GNB batteries instead of the R-Lines for now idc about batteries right now as i can always buy them after and like i said i have months to figure out. i have no clue what to so as for AIO. no that thing would debalance them and create a bomb damn battery chargers are expensive yeah it's a part of the expensive gear. something that lasts eternities but needs to be good"
so ok should i change my aio and also get walksnail x goggles?,Burning your house is more expensive true. is hota safe then
ok got that in my list. is there such thing as an AIO easy to solder?,"Yes https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/mamba-f740-aio-40a-6s-32bit-diatone-10503.html#/10105-version-basic i sent that earlier. i think Idk, I don't read every message on this channel"
your good.. this? https://www.getfpv.com/diatone-mamba-mk4-aio-f740-basic-fc-40a-6s-blheli-32-esc-25x25.html. just to make sure. for some reason it wouldnt let me copy the link on the other site. im on mobile btw,"by the way. the moonlight will probably not fit. with an aio If you put it on standoffs it will if you dont break off the expantion board like i did it seems to be good in my experience ima prob do that lmao. how do those work Well, you put the aio on some standoffs. Idk how to make it more clear I didn't say it was a good solution. Only that it works"
so. by elevating the drone height ?. or. putting the AIO on standoffs. elevating it,"Well, it lifts the top plate so you can put stuff under it well yeah thats what i was gonna do anyways isnt that what people normally do soo, how wouldnt it have fit originally .... The frames have standoffs from the factory. It's how you can put stuff inside the frame you just said its not an option Or else we would just have a carbon plate sandwich. Because we need them to build a frame"
Guys I Want To Buy the meteor 65 pro But I Don't Know What Version Of Jumper T Pro I Have (I Don't Know If Its The 1in4 or The ELRS 2.4). How Can You Check The Version?? And Is It Even Compatible With The Meteor 65 Pro??,"lol i know, you confused me cuz I said i was gonna obviously use standoffs for the drone. cuz thats how you elevate the drone plate, i just have a hard time understanding shit cuz my disorder. so , how wouldnt it have fit originally Well, to check you go back where you bought it and check in the order history. The meteor 65 pro has both an elrs and an frsky version, so it will be compatible even if you did the mistake of getting the 4 in 1 I Didn’t bought it , a friend gave it to me. And he didn’t told me Go into the radios menu If it's ELRS, there will be an elrs tab"
How to get there? (Sry I’m a beggar). Bigginer*. LOL,"Ok, got ya. put the AIO on standoffs to elevate it allowing more room for the moonlight. You will prefer to have a 20x20 stack honestly"
Wait the 1 in 4 Have a 2.4 ??,"The xrotor is 20x20, you should really consider getting this one would i need to tweak it and put standoffs or will it fit Well, yeah, but the frequency doesn't mean anything in this case. The xrotor should just fit without any issues sweet. sorry im stupid lol Don't worry, I encountered worse on this server if it can make you feel better It's quads not drones https://www.getfpv.com/hobbywing-xrotor-40a-3-6s-4-in-1-blheli-32-esc.html. thats the point lol Like The Controller Have a 2.4 Sticker on the antenna so Thats Why Im Asking Might want the fc that goes on top well ya. wait. did i post. MF That means the antenna is 2.4ghz, pretty irrelevant in this case HOW DO I KEEP PASTING THE WRONG ONE usually it's written on the box, or on some sticker on the radio (sometimes hidden in the module/battery bay). please don't multipost, it's infuriating. Yeah Thats Why I Asked If The 1in4 Ver Have 2.4 Both of them use 2.4ghz Both 4in1 and ELRS use 2.4Ghz We don't care about that We want the protocol. Not the frequency"
So what Meteor 65 pro version to get??. There is like 3,we'll tell you once we know the protocol Can't tell ya until we know the protocol YOU know what you bought. so get the box. the order details. or look at the radio Well apparently he didn't buy it
https://pyrodrone.com/products/hobbywing-xrotor-convertible-f7-45a-hd-stack-dji-pnp-20x20mm ?,And it was given to him. Yeah then they know who to ask I GOT IT FROM A FRIEND AND HE DIDN’T TOLD ME
so why are you asking us and not your friend?. We can only know from clues that you have,Im Not In contact with him anymore
CLUES??? IM A BEGGINER. I DONT KNOW ANYTHING,and I don't have a crystal ball :face_with_tears_of_joy:. nor your radio in my hands. I need information from you to tell you what you've got Jumper T Pro But I Dont Know What Version
Like The Carrying Case?,the packaging it's sold in No I dont have the packaging
Wasn't it a T lite before ?,SRY IM REALLY ANNOYING No need to write in capital letters
"is there anything written on the back of the radio, or in the battery bays?",Ummmmmm wait lemme check. It Says “Jumper T Pro” XD Idk im not next to the controller im at scholl. School*
How can you check the back of the controller while being at school?,I now just remembered why I used to always ask for photos There is precisely ZERO way that we're going to figure it out without the radio in someone's hands
Ok so when im back from school i will check again (It says at the antenna “2.4” but does the 1in4 have 2.4 too or only the ELRS?),"Both are 2.4ghz for the third time The T-Pro exists in 3 versions CC2500 (2.4Ghz), 4in1 (2.4GHz), ELRS 2.4GHz"
Which Version ?. Wait leeme screenshot rq,"I legitimately just considered muting you for trolling. because you can't have that short of a memory span I TOLD YOU IM A BEGINNER We just explained to you that until we know which radio you've got, we can't tell you which drone to get.. But okay Having a reasonable attention span has nothing to do with being new ELRS radio, ELRS drone.. That's it. Ehhhh there's a lot that can be attributed to being a zoomer 4in1/CC2500 are compatible, technically, with FRSKY/PNP But that shit is so unreliable that it's as good as not working that's not related. !frsky OKOK SRY THAT I DONT KNOW basically, frsky looses signal after a singular tree @ItsGal I'm not mad that you don't know I'm mad that you somehow forgot everything from 20 minutes of conversation where we explained all of that But i don’t understand anything im not that expert"
No offense but why did you ask for help in the first place when u at school and can't remember what radio you have? @ItsGal,"Then you have to say that you don't understand instead of continuing on another topic xD. anyway Idk maybe they could help look, understanding and memory are not related just come back once you are home with the radio in hand then we will be able to help Ok :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone: right now, this conversation is utterly pointless Radio: T-Pro ELRS -> Drone: ELRS @ItsGal  Radio: T-Pro 4in1 or CC2500 -> Drone: FRSKY **but FRSKY will most likely not work anyway, that protocol is dead for a good reason**  If you find out that you have the 4in1/CC2500 version of the radio, the best thing to do would be buy and to put an ELRS module on the back of it. (you don't want to invest into frsky) Ok ill text you guys when im home FRSKY SPI shit is cursed and it only got worse over the years and it was already pathetic  at the start"
I bought brand new FrSky Taranis. it has the new Access protocol!. how bind to my tinyhawk 2?,"ignore scout. im not getting it. its just there Well, again, get some gnb, instead, the flower ones would be pretty good. And you still don't have props (I would recommend some hw T3.5x2.5x3) what shape. i wanna look myself for props. i know its all preference. should be 3.5. otherwise i clicked the wrong link. https://www.getfpv.com/hqprop-t3-5x2-5x3-propeller-set-of-4.html. thank you sooo much for everytning You should get a lot of different props to know which you will prefer"
It's not?. it has put the same amount into both batteries,"Probably because you started one ever so slightly before. Or just fluctuations in the amps since it only shows to the tenth, but it might not be perfectly stable on the hundredth or thousandth. Well, the thing is, you can put a 4s 40A esc on a tinywhoop or on a 6"" quad, doesn't really mean anything at all about the actual drone"
"If you set up a vtx via smart audio, then disconnect the smart audio cable, will the vtx remember the tables ?. well channel, frequency","its a 5inch. and im prolly gonna be using 40a during peaks Yes, but just leave it on since it's soldered on the fc anyway I started both at same time. Channel 2 always Beats 1 so weird it is but I want to use the uart for GPS Yeah just annoying tho. Especially spending $$ on nice charger. I feel like something is wrong with channel 1 You shouldn't have to disconnect it, even an f405 should have like 4 uarts to connect the Rx, vtx and gps"
What could be the reason why my drone stops the motors 5-10 seconds after arming? The FC then flashes red and i cant arm anymore,"But you can configure the vtx directly with the button on the vtx, so yes you can just detach the smartaudio. It's probably just variations in the resistance of the battery causing the voltage to vary a bit causing the amps to vary a bit. Or some other minor issue. You could always run a self check on the charger if you feel like it"
hmm. could you show your motors tab?. or different question. try spinning the motors for a while. like 15 seconds and observe the gyro. dont move the drone at all,"voicechat, damit wir das problem schneller beheben können"
"uh. unless you got an ancient drone. camera goes into the flight controller. or what do you mean with ""osd switch"". like a little button panel?",Yeah that. It's got 5 buttons. This thing you can wire that up to your FC if you have a spare uart
Is it necessary to do? Or will the drone work just fine without it,It's so you can change the cameras settings
Any good recommendations for good goggles for around 200-300 dollars. my only option is analog right?,"Cobra X are the best option you have. anything higher than that and you might as well go digital And if i had some money to spare what would your reccomend if i wanna go digital Walksnail would probably end up the cheapest new. otherwise HDZero, the newer DJI goggles aren't the most capable Used DJI Goggles V2 for ~$250 still a good option. Can do analog, Vista/OG AU/ and O3 they're phasing those out ever so slowly. not worth it to me"
What walksnail goggles would u recommend? At the 350 ish price point,"Goggles X would be 450 new I think. the old dominator ones you can probably find second hand. maybe the X too. but remember that analog is fine What is the difference between box goggles and the ""normal"" goggle type it used to be size but with the cobra x it's more about how the screen displays. most normal goggles will have two screens, one for each eye. cobra x have one screen. they're maybe the only good box goggle"
Is there a big image quality difference?,"the cobra's have a great screen A cheap traditional goggles will look worse than a cobra Are there any non box maybe a bit more expensive normal goggles Yes there are some fancy analog goggles. Now if you want fancy goggles, go digital. But the cobra x v2 basically act like a traditional goggles since they actually use lenses Is there a middle ground between the cobras and let say the fat shark dominator or smth at that price Just get the cobra then upgrade to digital, there is no reason to get fancier analog goggles. Especially since the cobra x v2 are really really good, it's just a Skyzone o4x but in a box form factor"
"Hello, just got my radiomaster pocket. love it so far. gimbals a little stiff but nothing major. im wondering how do i check my edgetx version?. tried donwloading edgetx buddy but nothing in there helped","you can adjust the spring  tension if you want to yeah i just didnt expect i would need to use a hex tool that small also, you can check the version by going into the sys menu and one page to the left. personnally I invested in a precision bits set a while back, so all the tiny little screws aren't much of an issue"
yeah it says RM Factory 2023-07-27. but is that 2.9?. or lower maybe?. yeah gonna have to get those,"you have the version on the sercond line. on my boxer for exemple it's 2.8.0-factory. I highly recommend the ifixit mako or manta. well then I guess it should be 1fdb58ba, tho it's odd that you have this where me I have an intelligible number well i did download a newest firmware BIN file. I'll just flash it i guess I can't recommend iFixit tools at all honestly. they're not very high quality. I'd say get a big ol Wera set well I personnally never had any issues with them. btw I just realized but wera is what my electrician uses"
is better to bu Mavic 2 Pro or Mavic Air 2 ?,"Hello i am pretty newbie to fpv but i had a question is there a limit for amount of mw i can use for my transmitter If you anywhere thats isnt the us, the limit is  25mw for 5.8ghz  100mw 2.4ghz Oh so in europe i can’t even go past 25mw for 5.8 Legally no. Unless you have a license Nope :grinning_face_with_sweat:"
"Yo guys i got the cinelog 35 v2 but it's too loud, how do i reduce the sound? and how do i reduce the wind that it makes?","you remove the prop guards, get more blades, higher pitch"
Oh I just checked something did come undone. Bruh. Is that lil thing supposed to be connected as in sealed or just plugged in?,"That's a connector for your antenna. Just plug it back in, and make sure you never run your VTX without an antenna as it could easily be damaged."
is there a tutorial for setting up your drone with your controller and betaflight?,"Yes, bardwell has several hi guys im new into wing and ready to build my own plane,  and there is two way i cant decide which to go,  1. long range analog, idk did i really need that range or penetration, and many powerful accessories like 4k dvr & infra cam.  2. digital system, better video quality but kinda limited in system, also only dji have goggle in stock:Harold:"
hey if I fried my esc with my motors soldered does that mean they are fried too?,This has happend before and I fixed but I forgot how tho. I tried it again now its not connecting at all
Hi does anyone know if the speedybee F7 35a mini is compatible with analog cameras and vtx's?,"Yes but don't buy it. get a diatone mamba mk4 f722 mini f40 instead, same price but that one won't blow up for no reason"
i got a quick question i just bought the x12 from aliexpress but it says that it uses openvtx i just wanted to be sure but thats just analog right?  https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004814630483.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.69bd79d28ktB4c&gatewayAdapt=glo2nld,yes. openvtx is wildly used in aios okey so i should just be able to pair them with my goggles that are also analog all analog is compatible with all analog yes okey thank you thats what i needed to know I'm guessing this one is also analog
"it is compatible with an analog vtx and camera yes. but it isn't ""analog"", it can also work with any digital vtx and the stack in it self isn't analog either. what quad are you building btw ?",you might want an aio instead then
Have realy decided but I'm realy considering. What's the difference?,it's lighter. which is very important for a micro (and don't get anything speedybee)
"Literally just unboxed a DJI Mini 4k, is it normal for the gimbal to feel Really loose?","Pretty much. All of the DJI gimbals are kinda springy when not used Cool, Ty!. Was half expecting a day zero return.."

but why do you have it?. Probably these holes,"How do I fit this. on a DJI F405 by the looks of it on amazon and AliExpress, you stick the fc on with double side tape :PepeKEKhands: Yeah. but how do I fit it. on the frame. It came with tape in the box Doesnt seem to fit anywhere"
So When I connect that ELRS Module To My Jumper T pro The ELRS Option will just appear in the binding settings? or i need to do some kind of setup? @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks),"Iirc you will, in the radio, have an elrs or external transmitter option, but I don't use one so I'm not so sure. So, could you go into the system menu and send us a picture of what it shows so we can know if it's the ELRS version of not i didnt bought it yet,when i will ill ask for help"
"Very new to building fpv sonplease dont judge, trying to finish up a drone and last thing i need is getting the r9 reciever soldered in, the reciever did not come with wires, do i need any special kinda wire for this?","just regular 28awg wire will do, ideally pretinned.. you can use 26 or 30awg aswell"
Me: Is it Thing A or thing B (in thing C)? Response: in thing D. :WaitWhat:,Like in a drone there's a VTX and an ELRS receiver. And they are completely unrelated
Why do you think you couldn't?. Trying to figure out where the misconception is stemming from xD,"IDK... :skull:. TY anyways. If we're not talking about DJI stuff, the RC and Video systems are completely separate @Arjun they know nothing of each others existence"
Also can you suggest a good budget VTX and receiver?,"And as far as analog video and ELRS goes, you don't need to use the same manufacturer anywhere. you can have a RadioMaster radio and a HappyModel receiver. or you could have a Rush VTX and Eachine goggles"
"What radio?. Yes, but not exactly what I'd consider budget","ok, so ELRS 2.4GHz (there's also ELRS 900MHz, don't mix them up) For that, frankly, any ELRS 2.4GHz receiver will work.  Just make sure that the receiver is actually listed as supported by ELRS.  Recently, some manufacturers have been selling crappy untested receivers, making them work by masquerading as other brands' or generic receivers. The most ""standard"" ELRS receivers you can find are the EP1 and EP2. EP1 is a normal single external antenna receiver. Good for general 5"" flying. EP2 has an on-board tower antenna. Good for small stuff not made of carbon fiber. RadioMaster sells their own counterparts - RP1, RP2, also good."
Is this a good VTX?: SpeedyBee TX800,"As far as transmitting good video goes, it's fine.  I don't particularly like it because it requires external 5V power, instead of being possible to power from a higher voltage.. You have to power it from the flight controller's 5V which is always a bit sketchy with something as high power as a VTX."
Hmm.. Would you say that this is a good receiver?:,The price is a bit.. wow
Oh.. What receiver and VTX would you recommend?,Amazon is baaad. wait. no. You can get a much better receiver for that amount of money*. Just not off of amazon Oh.. The same receiver is out of stock basically everywhere.
"As I said, pretty much anything ELRS 2.4GHz will work. what drone is it for?","5"".. If that answers your question. This is what I got so far.:"
Is this good? @The GGManiack,"@Arjun wth why is everything elrs out of stock in the US IDK. :loudly_crying_face: gimme a sec. imma check which receivers are good brooo i got the same setup, works well"
"just looked at your list and its identical to mine, for rx you got ep1 or ep2?","if you're going to the elrs side, get ep1. nice It's just that everything is out of stock."
What's the cheapest one?,"single antenna ones are going to be cheaper, generally. the BayckRC one seems cheapest I think I'll go with this one.: https://www.racedayquads.com/products/radiomaster-rp1-v2-2-4ghz-elrs-nano-receiver. Yeah. Quick warning. that receiver probabyl doesn't come with wires yeah but you can get the spare wires of the cam or smth else Also, if you're goign to pay $23 for a receiver, get a better one almost every part comes with spare wires Yeah that's what I saw some guy doing. are the prices cursed for just me or wth everybodys wallet hurts for the price of the RP1 V2, you can have a better receiver, in the dual antenna category.. Like the NewBeeDrone one, or for $2 more, the SkyStars or GEpRC @Arjun and some of those come with wires :KEKw:"
I think this is good?:. Dual Antenna will give me more range right?. Now I need a VTX.,"the TX800 is good, just make sure to buy a better antenna than the antenna that comes with the vtx. it got 4 settings, it can go up to 800mW In this case it's primarily more reliability. This recevier only runs one antenna at a time, but it can switch between them based on which is getting a better signal The TX800 is just a bit on the expensive side though.. Ohh. There are ""true diversity"" receivers which run both antennas at the same time. basically 2 receivers in 1 package. The difference is:  True diversity: Both antennas try to receive at the same time, only one has to succeed. It has 2 tries to receive each packet.  Antenna diversity: One antenna receives. If it fails to receive, the used antenna is changed. Next try happens on the other antenna. This way, when one antenna gets in a bad orientation, since it fails to receive, reception will switch to the other antenna with hopefully better orientation.  @Arjun"
Thanks for the explanation.. Also should I get clean flux or no clean?,"True diversity slightly improves range (by statistics - 2 tries to receive each packet instead of 1) and considerably improves reliability.  Antenna diversity improves reliability.. get flux. That's what matters. No clean flux is still better to clean off, but less of a pain."
"@Arjun btw, isn't the stack cheaper on Pyrodrone or RDQ?. @Arjun https://pyrodrone.com/products/speedybee-f405-v4-stack-w-55a-3-6s-bls-4in1-esc-30x30mm","Yeah but if anything went wrong, I can return the stack back to Amazon with a 100% refund."
:Harold:. what camera btw?. Foxeer Micro describes like 10 different ones,"In that short flight my motors are now roughly 60c ish. Explain this people with iq than me. Nothing has changed since last flight and ive changed props.. The one time i got to the place thats 8 mile away it does this, fuckin :pepereeeintensifies:"
Can you send a picture of your props?,"I'm not worried about if they're new or not, I want to see the orientation you put them in If they weren't on the right, it wouldn't fly cant see nothing like this lol, they're supposed to be put in in way so the motors move and they push air down. w/ the little I can process from that pic, the upper-left is not right, and maybe the lower-left"
"There were some hard oscillations there... interesting.. As for props - if you put them upside down, it will fly, but very poorly.. The prop spin directions are correct (as you said, it wouldn't fly if they weren't), but from the pic it's difficult to say if they're upright.. @HappyFishMan If ELRS, could you have accidentally changed the Packet Rate?","They are upright, i changed the props to see if it would fix the problem, i had flown on them previously check for any loose things, and check the packet rate if it's as intended. seen issues like these stem from loose motors, arms, FC's, wires, etc. It will fly but, its very twitchy Don't fly it, you'll cook motors or worse. you can hear the PD oscillations, it's not working right. you gotta figure out what changed Nope, elrs is the same as always. 500mhz, 100mw, 1:128. Nothings loose small m so millihertz Might just try to grab the stock pid tune, i hadn't changed it anyway I will never remember lol whenever someone writes 10mb. I lel because  millibits Is there a chance that I am restricted when it comes to the ghz I can only set 5Ghz  Im talking about my Goggles 2"
"Yall mind picking out only the pid bits? None of the motor, receiver, vtx, etc. I think ik where it start and ends but i dont wanna have to re configure it. I got Bluetooth so worth a shot. Thats or ill load a preset from speedy",make  a diff all...  @HappyFishMan
No?. Boiling plastic doesn't sound great,"God damn. Lemme see if i can make it a .txt Is 5Ghz good for my Goggles 2 or is that bad. I had major video signal issues yesterday and I dont know what couldve caused it... We once again have about zero clue what you're saying. your video uses 5GHz. why would that be bad Ok. I have no idea. what coudlve caused my video loss Low output power, poorly plugged in antennas, shitty antennas, environment. an infinite amount of things. more or less would need dvr or accurate descriptions of where you were in relation to the drone How do I make the output power higher. What output power should I run for good connection. Im runing the default O3 antennas. They should be good. This is where I was sitting Speedy wont let me download the file so, this is best i can do on phone I have zero idea on how to do that on DJI, most people don't know so you'd have to search that really just looks like you need a higher output power or better antennas"
Shouldnt the stock antennas be just fine?. Both the DJi O3 ones and the Goggles 2 ones,the goggles 2 don't have the greatest antennas but they should make it past those trees. at least I would think so I see people flying much crazier places with much signal obstrucion like trees and buildings and no signal loss. I need to find out what cuased this because finding my quad after that crash yesterday was a miracle.... That luck I might not have a second time... yes so test somewhere safer and bump up the output power I need to find out how to do so first...
How many channels does it show?,as I said only one. On 20mhz I see 3. Meaning Im in EU most likely <https://oscarliang.com/dji-o3-air-unit-fpv-goggles-2/#Unlock-FCC-Mode>. do that
"Working on it. Where is this ""root directory""?","the first one. like. I don't know how to explain this to you honestly say you have an sd card, when you open that in file explorer that would be the root directory `/`. opening a folder in the sd card would be leaving the root directory of the sd card So just open the drive"
Gotcha thanks. Well and thats all?. More power now? @Emilia (XT90 Janklet),now somewhere in the menu you should be able to select higher power. and have more channels available I do have more channels but Power I cant find I have zero clue how you'd select that on DJI I read online that its just default. No settings it just does it well there you go then. done
And what are the channels needed for?. I will most likely stick to CH1 because why would I need a multi channel setup,to select different frequenciex. so that's either for when you're flying with someone else. or trying to avoid wifi and such
Is this a bad idea?. I used tape to sort of make the antenna thicker so it fits my TPU.. Only the bottom tough,I don’t see any issues with that Allright. Thanks to all of you!
Quick question. I've got a new lr build that I'm just about to finish but ran out of recievers in my parts bin. I usually buy elrs ep1 for the external antenna but they are out of stock pretty much everywhere locally. The only ones left are the ep2 with the ceramic antenna. I've done 2km on these historically but I was wondering  whether to bite the bullet and buy it or wait for the external antenna ones to restock. Are the ceramic antenna good enough to run temporarily?,"Might as well get an RP4TD. or another gemini receiver. and if you're going to try the ceramic for now, put it outside of the carbon"
I don't have a Gemini capable tx?,It can run in normal diversity mode. and then it's always there for when you do get a gemini tx There is a dual tcx0 ep1. What is the realistic range I can get on the ceramic antennas
"Hey, are there any recommended 3d modifications for the TBS Source One V5?","If it turns out not to be enough, break off the ceramic antenna and replace it with a piece of wire There is 4 contacts for the antenna. Is that for smd stability Only one is active. The other three are just for attachment What is the range before vs after for this. How do I remove the antenna do I just heat the base of the pcb ""how long is a piece of rope"". Switching to a wire will probably increase your antenna gain by about 2-3 dBi, so maybe double the range"
Just a generic figure. A random guess. Before 4km so after 8? Something like that,"The actual range depends on too many factors. If you got 4km out of the ceramic antenna, under the exact same conditions you could expect 6-8 from a properly made wire antenna"
Are there any recommended 3d modifications for the TBS Source One V5?,"Fixed, just loaded the stock cli dump and now it works.  FC was a little goober. tho, its not all bad. the type c on the fc is working now. it didnt before"
Can i get away with running 20 awg for   Up to 24v for my receiver wire?,"gauge determines the current Break it down for someone that got into fpv last week that knows nothing about how electrical works besides bare bones basics the voltage rating will be in the hundreds of volts I=V/R. P = I * V. what this means is heat generated is affected by the current flowing through, and the voltage drop across the wire, and thus the resistance. thicker wire has lower resistance and more mass, and thus can carry more current without heating up too much. voltage rating is dependent on the insulation, what voltage is required to break through it. typically this is in the hundreds of volts so way above anything you'll encounter int he hobby. what's that it's plant number 7710. obviously"
What do you mean the wheel has come off ?,"It's a figure of speech. Things aren't going according to plan Means shit's gone sideways. Ok. Well, check if the esc solder pads are good first. Then check if there is any screw touching the windings, if you have any broken coil Well they worked well enough to do the motor direction..."
"If it's none of those, swap the motor with one of the motors that did spin so you know if it's a motor or esc ossue. Well, does it spin if you go into betaflight and ask the fc to make the motor spin ?. Or does it still just twitch when it tries to spin",Bah. Tear it down again it is then :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:
Did it spin with betaflight?,"It's a foxwhoop 25 build. Bloody thing is a fucker to work on. Doesn't really answer Not when I did it last night. Still having my morning brew and smoke. Just try and see if it turns in betaflight (if it just twitches stop the motor, no need to hurt the esc and maybe motor) then do the steps I gave before. And you will probably know where the issue is I was hoping I'd just missed something obvious and stupid, and I wasn't gonna have to start basic diagnostics.. Oh well."
I know but how does the built in one work?,"it stabilize the footage rock steady is like gyro flow, horizon thing makes it so the footage is always centered on the horizon iirc"
I know. Dont you usually have to pull gyro data and do that in the software?,there is a gyro in the camera so it makes the footage smoother. it just does it automatically
Like with a hero 11?. or like gopro does it basically?,I have no idea how a gopro does it. but the point of rock steady is that it does the work for you and you can just have a stabilized footage directly Well they basically have built in image smoothing aswell I would assume it works the same then
Does this work without a beeper?. Is this for the dshot beeping?,"This AIO's ESCs are chuffing dead. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. Stripped it from the quad, removed the VTx and Rx, removed all the motors.  Re soldered the motors to different pads, and now it won't even start without tripping the shortsaver.. It talks to BF configurator fine over usb, but trips the shortsaver instantly on LiPo power.  None of the motor screws were long enough to contact any coils, I triple checked as I was assembling, having made that mistake before.. Gonna remove all the motors and see what happens.. Could be one or more motors are shorted.... -.- your quad can use the motors has a beeper then you have the answer My question was if the RX_LOST works with the dshot motor beepers the fc can use the motors to beep for RX_LOST or any of the beeper alarms"
So the motors will start beeping once telementry is lost?,"if you loose rx (or failsafe) and you set it to beep if you loose RX then the motors will beep when you loose rx. and you can loose telemetry but keep the signal, RX loss if when you failsafe"
"Hi, does anyone know how to flash back from quicksilver to betaflight?",Nope. Still trips the shortsaver with just a bare board. Oh FFS.
Is It Okay If I Buy a BT2.0 300mAh 1S 30/60C Battery For A Drone That Use a BT2.0 300mAh 1S 75C Battery ?. Does The C Matters Or Not ?,it is a measure of the performance of the cells. more C=less sag
and where can i get a BT2.0 300mAh 1S 75C Battery? (2PCS NOT MORE OR LESS exactly 2 ),for some reason i cant find you just need them to be the folded cells
idk why. wdym folde cells?,"you want the betafpv lava/tattu/newbeedrone/tinywhoop/dogcom stick batteries i want batteries for the Meteor 65pro yeah, grab one of them YEAH I KNOW BUT I CANT FIND ANY https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/batterie-lihv-lava-1s-300mah-75c-5pcs-betafpv-12308.html. for exemple"
im so dumb. btw is it okay that ill order batteries for Aliexpress?,"aliexpress is like amazon, I would recommend you get from a real fpv shop, but it will work"
for example: is this okay for my meteor 65 pro ? (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006120570115.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.19.35705bEh5bEhr5&algo_pvid=6c16d458-7038-4725-917a-ed2ddbc35ae2&algo_exp_id=6c16d458-7038-4725-917a-ed2ddbc35ae2-9&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21ILS%2175.03%2137.52%21%21%21142.48%2171.24%21%40211b61d017155163442292556eebfd%2112000035843674492%21sea%21IL%213570306894%21&curPageLogUid=FZP3FUL1kYWz&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A),they are surpisingly cheap but in theory these are the ones THE 2 PCS. yeah thats why i asked they should be the one
Even that they are not the same C ?,the blue cells betafpv ships with the quad are garbage. more C just means more performance
are you sure?. ok. It Doent lokk THAT bad,"I had the betafpv 65pro, they come with the blue betafpv cells, and they are rolled cells instead of the folded cells you want"
what are the difference ? (IN PREFORMANCE),less battery sag so more power
but is there difference in time flight ? (like time in air),a bit. but it will fly better basically
so should i order moer than 2 PCS?,Because I thought  That Ill order 2 PCS and Get 2 More In the drone so ill have 4 especially since 1 battery last like 3min
so these last more than the betafpv batteries?,they perform better mainly
so what do you say: 2PCS or 4 PCS ? (i don't have a lot of budget),"well, I would say 4 so you have 6 batteries in total, so more time in the air yeah. thanks for the help and they are like 5 bucks a battery when you pay them full price so it's not has big of an investment"
so these are fine right?. those*,"well, personnally I would encourage you to get them from a real fpv shop since I don't trust aliexpress. but they should probably be real on aliexpress, I personnally can't be sure, which is why I prefer to use some real fpv shops"
yeah. Wait But The Voltage in the aliexpress one is 3.8 and in the ones that come with the drone its 4.35. is it okay ?,"yeah. 3.8v is the nominal voltage, 4.35 is the charged voltage"
"Hey everyone, For drones that have the battery under the frame, are they supposed to sit flat on the ground ? Because for me the strap makes it never level ? Because whenever I arm the drone it tilts and hits the ground.","3.8v is the voltage at 50% charge, the average voltage, 4.35v is the voltage when it is fully charged if it smacks into the ground when you arms it's not because the quad is tilted because of the battery strap. it's probably that you have one motor that runs in reverse or that you didn't put the props on correctly that's not going to solve the issue of the quad smacking the ground"
Does anyone know we're this cable goes?,"You want to get the ExpressLRS version of both. On top of that, you probably don't want a tinyhawk.. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639/1144567226670788639. I am guessing they'd all be plenty durable, but the battery on say a go 3 would last less long. If weight isn't a consideration go with the full GoPro.. Since you have 4 white wires (motor ones) and then there's a no-connect pin, a ground pin and then a signal pin and then a power pin it can literally only be one of those."
I flew my drone right now but after I plugged in the second battery I couldnt fly anymore. I have telemtry but no video Connection and I cant even arm the drone.  Does anyone know why?,Unplug it and start inspecting. obviously no one knows why your stuff broke when there's no details Everything seems fine tbh When I got the drone from a friend  it was connected to the current signal next to the USB port
That's definitely not where that goes I'd imagine.... ESC telemetry is quite useful. Where does it go on the esc?,Idk I'm like brand new to drones and have absolutely no idea what goes where. This is what it looked like before I took it apart Already bought it a few years back. It looks like something that won't fly in all honesty
Could i solder a elrs reciever to it?,"Those solder joints are awful, but you need to clean the thing up Yeah completely agree but somehow it did fly You should be able to if your FC has a free UART Yeah the previous owner clearly didn't take care of it you can solder like a happymodel ep2 to it. In your picture the yellow wire is just attached to the plug, not the current wire Like the previous owner gave me this and I have no contacts with him and i barely know anything about drones almost mean to give you it. lol Yeah lol I've been avoiding it for months ngl"
Is it worth getting a controller and sim before my actual drone so I can practice while I finalize my decision?,then i guess no 1s or 2s
woah nice main frame. did you clean the FC?,"i would throw this thing in the trash. this makes me shed a tear I cant tho. This is it rn thx it took me 7 hours :skull: not yet :loudly_crying_face:  I have so much to do still. tysm update us on how it goes planning on getting my first cinewhoop. Would you guyw suggest a sub 250gr Copter or go for a little bigger obe like a 35. Not sure if 250 makes more sense for easyier regulations or just go for obe who can mount an action cam aswell :man_shrugging: 2-2.5"" builds are great if you only want to carry an O3/naked gopro/other light HD camera. 3-3.5"" are good for hauling a full weight gopro mhmm, so probably should go for a 3.5. or just stick with O3"
do you intend to fly mainly fly them indoors or outdoors?,should be a practice drone for nice shots / 100% outdoor. So maybe the Geprc Cinelog 35 yeah that's a good option my other alternative was the iFlight Defender 25. I battery option is below 250gr with the other one it’s above and good flight time. :man_shrugging::face_with_tears_of_joy: that's a pretty shitty alternative iFlight quads are usually good... not the Defender series filled with proprietary crap and all so i guess ill just grab the Cinelog 35 and not a smaller drone. and later the summer a bigger obe :smiling_face:. one* smaller cinewhoops can be good. just not the defender ones lol
whats your favourite? for outdoor aswell :thinking_face:. something like the Pavo?,"I don't fly cinewhoops, they're not for the kind of flying I enjoy"
ahh i see. whats your favourite small copter then? :thinking_face::beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,"Well, it's designed to run on 3s the only pre-built drone I have is no longer being sold. if you want a cinewhoop for actual cinewhoop uses, it's a great option... if you just want it because the prop guards add some sense of security, then it's probably not a great idea ahh, i see :grinning_face_with_sweat: im not that far into yet to build my own i think i want it for cinewhoop uses hahah not much freestyle, just avata 2 kinda like video shots yeah that's fine then Mr Shutterbug did a video on it back in the day iirc thanks :raising_hands::smiling_face: it's a meme quad more than anything... but I still haven't managed to kill it in the 3 years that I've had it. despite multiple attempts at flying 3D and much more"
What do you mean it's a meme quad ?,"6s ""toothpick"" build, running a 3 layer 16x16 stack Sounds fun. Tho I don't know how the 16x16 didn't blow up since all the 16x16 stacks I found so far only have like 13A 3s Oh. Well it's impressive it didn't explode yet. I kinda want to build a 6s 65mm with a 16x16 stacks 1.6"" props and 6 of the 48mah lipos of tinywhoop.com in series now the motors only draw like 5.2A Well it's some 1106 motors so yeah it shouldn't draw much, but is that total or per motor That makes more sense"
Can i check in Betaflight why mo quad wont arm somehow?,A Black Sheep Telemetry device is causing a disarm.. :3Head:. Thank you!
"So with the DJI Mini 4K, can I actually take off and land myself, or must I always let the drone do it?. Not seen a setting for that anywhere",Both sticks down and together will spin the motors up. And then throttle up and it will liftoff
is it worth swapping 1604 2850kv motors on a 6s 4 inch prop 400g auw to 2004/2204 motors?,I think he explains it in the video are these rechargable https://pyrodrone.com/products/radiomaster-18650-3200mah-3-7v-battery-2pcs-for-tx16s-boxer-tx12-pocket-mt12-radios
aight. what charger?. or does anyuthing work,many radios can charge the battereis while they are in the radio ooo. lemem see if the boxer can do that oh ya the boxer can. @ShoutMessage
hell yeah. just plug it in to my pc or the wall?. welp im prolly gonna order my stuff today. hyped af,"just wantd to double check..... theres a seperate type c port for charging so it doesnt matter ah. letsgo. thank you! why does this come up when Im trying to get beta flight signing apps to make this thing not pop up costs a lot of money. if you got it from the official repo, you can run it anyway its red. mine is normally blue or white nothing to worry about it's dependent on the system theme go on enjoy betaflight idk if I should run it tho. https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/tag/10.10.0. is that it then run betaflight in chrome. if you are actually scared bet. ive had to many virus's Yes. I picked for me only as Im the only one flying drones"
I cannot connect my drone (Mobula 6 2024) to betaflight and there is also no RX wifi when I plug in a battery to the drone. Anyone know why?,What does it say when you plug it in
screenshot of device manager?,there is nothing. I mean after I connect nothing changes try a different cable I also tried using this. tried it too but I think thats not the problem since it worked with the same cable couple days ago tried every port nothing works
"this is because when you flashed to the newest firmware you wiped your configuration. and I'm assuming you have no backup?. I have found a some CLI dumps for the Cetus X, do you know which specific model it is?","Hello. I have a Cetus X and flashed the newest firmware in betaflight. I now have a problem getting everything to work, and want to  go back back to stock and start over. I was able to figure out the OSD problem, but I am now not able to get my radio to bind with it. I have tried to bind and also bind in Betaflight. I could use a little assist here on this. I am not sure how to request this information and parse what is found on Google. I figured it would be easier to ask here. I did have the forethought to make a backup prior to flashing. It seems like it doesn't take though. did you make sure to type ""save"" after loading the backup i want to say yes, but should verify. I’ll try again in a couple minutes.. I did not type save. That problem is solved. The last bit of issue is with the radio and not binding or acting correctly when bound to the Cetus. I'll continue to look for more solutions and I appreciate the time you took to help me get this far. I am still fairly new, and am eager and looking forward to learning."
Does It Really Matter? Cus Its A Sim That Not Alot Of People Know (And Its Free). Its FPV.SkyDive,"I mean... yeah. So that I can figure out what rate system they use try changing the rates from Actual to Betaflight Yeah Now Its Working,Thanks"
how much V does get GOPRO mother board takes in ?,"There's nothing in the Betaflight code that artificially limits the output. Either you are getting an artificial limitation from your GPS module, or your quad doesn't go faster than that. Bear in mind that GPS speed is a calculated value, and its accuracy is dependent on the update rate of your GPS"
do you need to switch something on over betaflight in order to turn on 9v pad on mamba stack?,"A ok. I recorded my speed when punching out last night and it stopped at exactly 150km/h even if I increased throttle Every quad has a point where it doesn't go faster. Parasitic drag and wattage start to balance and more power no longer means more speed. It might just so happen that yours happens to be a nice round number. Try pinning the throttle for a few seconds with a full battery, see if it's still stuck at 150. No weird, the 9v led indicator is also turned off. this is a brand new fc"
Did you bridge the 9V output pad as shown in the manual?,oh my. youre a life saver. i don't know how much to thank you @DædalusFPV
what does vcc correspond to?,"Direct battery voltage. So just a passthrough from the battery to the pads. Or VOLTAGE collector to collector if you want to feel fancy oh forgot to mention that i was using this pads, not the plug type one So that's where you wire the power hungry stuff (if they are rated for the voltage)"
you think bridging them still works?,Bridge them like in the manual if you want 9v. (and you run 6s)
does not bridging them disables all 9v pads?,"I would assume it does disable the 9v/vcc pads Not bridging them means the 9V reg does not get power to feed the output pins. If you don't bridge the other side (for VCC), then power does not get passed through directly to the output pins So you disable the pads Essentially they are NC until you bridge one side or the other, yes"
What if you bridge both sides tho ?,"The 9V reg would short out, at best, I would think. It'd be getting VCC from both ends i have a FrSky Archer Plus RS Mini Receiver and have a 4 in 1 zorro. Not able to bind. Please help That is an ACCESS receiver. 4 in 1 does not support ACCESS protocol. It will not bind"
does anyoe know which pin on GOPRO motherboard is 5V ?. I would think the one next tp gnd ?,Give it 5v via usb and just start probing with a multi meter
Does it not show that pad above/left of the input socket as 5v?,"It does but seems abit sketchy to me. P. :p My best guess is that you'd want something other than the USB input one. It's not sketchy though, it'd just go through some extra regulators and such I would think it wouls be better to feed it through the battery but i am not sure where 5V I assume the battery wouldn't be 5v"
Doesnt batteru go through bec first?m. So my safest bet would be to solder directly to pads ?,Not necessarily. The bec might need a high voltage than 5v. And then you get losses from the be c
What?. ELRS is a *control* link. For *remote control*. It's not an autopilot,"i need help with ELRS. how does it work. do i need a radio controller. cant i just fly it autonomous oooh. so. what do i need. for auoto Ardupilot or Inav probably yes i will use ardu. but. for signal. telemtry i think ELRS airport for just mavlink telemetry, I believe. If you need a control link to command it from the PC using QGC or Mission Planner, you will also need a normal ELRS link"

"Hello, quick question. At what amp should i charge these batteries? 0.4? https://www.gaoneng.shop/products/gaoneng-gnb-3s-11.1v-450mah-80c-xt30-lipo-battery","Gemini can do both, since it's dual tx and dual rx. It's a good idea to recommend it, I don't know if any modules are out for it yet though. The Jumper T20S can do it. Yup, that's right. By the way you can get far better batteries for that price. GNB flowers, DOGCOM, CNHL ministar/pizza and R-Lines"
"You're the best, thank you!. in what way are they better?. more mAh?. quality wise?. just want to know the difference between a good and a bad battery haha","Quality, output power. They'll also last longer since they're more capable cells"
"Can it? I thought Airport required an entirely different firmware, and Gemini is dual-channel transmission of the same control packets. Have they combined them all now?",there's a very active branch called mavlink-rc that can do it really well. not sure when that'll be finished or anything Ok a branch is a far thing from being mainline you're doing ardu I'm sure they can flash a branch They can barely do their own research lol How do i bind elrs to my controller. using betflight. 2 of us struggling atm
Exactly which ELRS receiver are you using?,"what controller what receiver radiomaster pocket. uhh whatever reciever is used on the meteor 65 pro and the happymodel crux 3. tryna connect both. having issue with both. can we hop ina vc. im clueless very new to the hobby I don't think either of those are SPI receivers, so you don't do the binding in Betaflight at all oh. how do i do it then You should be able to flash them from ELRS Configurator using Betaflight Passthrough mode. Flash the receivers and the controller with the same bind-phrase and they should all link up automatically whats betflight passthrouhg mode. can u join call and ill screenshare. pls bro. im so braindead. im gonna end up fucking smth up take a step back and read through the ELRS docs. You don't have to follow them yet, just try to understand the general process There are video tutorials on Youtube as well if reading is hard for you"
How many dji battery charges are too many for resell drone? Also what should the the V of the batteries when storing them for longer?,im intimidated by soldering… practice. youll get used to it. if you put enoug time into it itll be easy. and if you ave good equipment i definitely need a practice board. i dont think i want to build my first drone though… im probably just gonna get a cinewhoop. then once im ready ill build one. y a cinewoop if i may ask idk. looking at defenders are you gonna be flying near people or expensive tings like supercars i live in a decently urban area . i just like the portability and size. im not gonna go above 4 inches cinewoops just fly alot worse tan open props Does anyone know how to tell what radios work with what recievers im trying to get a rm tx12 and dont actually know what recievers will work with it
what version of the TX12 did you get?,get good goggles and a good radio instead then all ELRS 2.4GHz receivers should work anyting 2.4gz elrs ten. drones cras. your radio and goggles dont
maybe… idk though. Then after i get good with that build a really nice one?,alr what website should i use to find the reciever as my local websites dont really come up with anything
"btw, this may be a dumb question but do people ever harvest the esc or fc out of an old drone and put it into a new drone?",if teyre still working and modern sure y not. @EpikFPV. dang
"is soldering really even hard? like whats the hard part about it, getting good solder joints, or the chord mess",getting good joints. you wont be good in te beginning. you can only learn by doing it its not smart doing it on the drone build itself correct. practicing* not really. best to just get a ceap practice board how long does it usually take to build a drone (mine will be 3.5 in) heres the specs possibly.. im scared its a fire hazard supposedly wat kv are te motors. cause for a first build you dont want 6s on a 3.5'' Your FPV Unmanned tech Hobby RC Flying tech Airjacker  Enjoy @CalvinMX whats wrong with 6s on a 3.5
heavy?. oooh. lol. your name,unless youre carryinga full size gopro on a 3.5 you dont want 6s on it
"sorry. hmm. ok, what do u think of nazguls btw? i may also just deck out a prebuilt drone instead of fully customize it","nazgul5 v3 is pretty good. dont get evoques. unless youre weird. geprc mark 5 is also really good i just want a drone i can easily repair and learn a little bit more about drones. i like geprc a bit more https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/843318094772174899/1085976078176223374/My_beloved.gif supposedly its also better so yea. avent flown eiter of em what do u think about fat shark scout not enough to make the price difference worth it, I still really like the Mark5 tho. no :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: get cobra X v2's. yea you're lucky thats not a mute i wanna go walksnail route. cuz. cool name not really te reason to go for a system lol. but walksnail is good. alot of people love it. youd need differet goggles to. walksnail is digital you can find dominator HDs for pretty cheap used, get Goggles X, or get the Cobra X and throw on a Walksnail VRX"
ya walksnail avatars?. or goggles x,whats difference from digital and whattchamacallet analog. digital = 0101001010100 analog = ~~~~~~~~. basically. digital better view. but expensive. and more latency
theres nothing wrong with getting pre builts?,"these seem like very different things to me alot of people get prebuilts i dont see the difference the quad I fly most is prebuilt, if we ignore the fact that every single component except for the frame, esc, and 1 motor has been replaced thats what im gonna end up doing ima bet. see its a tough decision for me. custom route helps me understand the drones more and helps me learn to solder. pre built route is easier…. lol..:face_with_tears_of_joy: youll need to solder eiter way once you eventually cras"
"sooner or later. thats the issue. once i crash am I fucked with a cherry on top? (since idk wtf im doing ),or am i not as fucked (since I know my drone and i can easily repair it). pre built sounds better. and I can always repair or upgrade.","you oughta get a pinecil, practice board, and some solder, so you will be prepared for when you inevitably fuck something up"
i have a solder already. https://www.getfpv.com/flywoo-explorer-lr-4-hd-quadcopter-w-walksnail-avatar.html. this good?,"it's a decent cruiser i need help with my radio, my pitch stick isn't centred even if i calibrated it few times radiomaster zorro 2.4ghz elrs"
are the trim switches centered?,oh. thx. i didnt know they do smth
im still gonna build it @Mr.SlowFood but were my specs good? definitely not gonna do 6s,yeah just need walksnail goggles and maybe get a radiomaster boxer instead
actually. im probably just gonna get a cheaper fpv drone with really good goggles and controller.  you said crux is good what about  this one? https://www.getfpv.com/happymodel-crux35-4s-hd-freestyle-racing-drone-w-caddx-nebula-nano.html,if you wanna fly DJI digital sure
"Mobula6, barely used, Im on the right frequency yet video looks bad. Worked fine before, didn’t change anything. Fault is not my goggles as it works fine with all my other analog drones, any idea what it could be?",well. check your antenna wires It looks fine. No damage or anything
Does it say vtx ready on the right in betaflight?,Ufl looks plugged in aswell
"Ohh let me check. with and without a battery, same stuff. does it need smart audio?","no i dont. i want to go walksnail . i thought it said walksnail.. crap. idk what to get Check the wires between the vtx and aio. if any. It does say device ready though. so there shouldn't be an issue Black wire (theres red, yellow and black) looks a little pulled out. Nvm, it's dust. I just opened it up. All looks fine. It was untouched for a month"
"Where should i buy used camera drones? also, should i even buy used or just buy new one","Re-plugged everything and still same issue you wouldn't be able to put the GoPro in at all. TPU is flexible, so it can stretch a little and hold it snug with a little mechanism you could. depends on where you live"
More mah = more flight time?,"More mAh = bigger cells = more weight but more flight time till a certain amount of weight If your quad is too heavy you're just wasting those extra mAh on keeping it in the air. Also, too much weight and its less powerful"
Hmmm i was thinking that charging 1s batteries with 6s (bigger capcity) on vifly whoopster. Do you think that would be posibble?,"Yes, if you are somewhere in the field or so, you can do that. Although check your charger specs. And check if it supports that"
You dont need balancer plug from 6s to 1s?,Depends on what Charger u got Vifly whoopster 2. It doesnt have so i assume it doesnt need :person_shrugging:. But rather ask then boom boom. Vifly whoopster 3 my bad Yes u can charge ur 1S batts with a 6S batt
What mah battery would you reccomend? :thinking_face:,"I'm a ""the bigger the better"" type of person, but I honestly wouldn't know what to get yourself. Depends a bit"
Or would it affect somehow if i put there 6s?. Yep,"No, capacity is bigger 33% on 6S as 2 more cells"
Hmm i was looking at batteries and they have XT60 Black connector and yellow is that the same?,"I honestly don't really know, but I'm sure you can charge ur batts quite a few times then. Yes that's just color I mean i just wanna charge them maximum of 2 or 4 Times because 10 batteries. Oh okey. I think 1500mah seems good ig d6 pro shoud charge it fine I would recommend getting a large li ion pack for charging. If you want you can also make it yourself with some li ion cells"
You told me liion because they arent so dangerous?,They tend to work very well for large power banks No higher capacity for same weight And you can make very large capacity banks Liion can actually work i have a shop near me that sells these stuff. But not sure what exatly everything i need That's perfect. U can go to 3000-4000mAh easily
How much like batteries would that me together?,There are a few videos on YouTube of different methods. I think Criss Rosser has a good one. 4s- and as many parallel in you want for capacity
I mean like batteries induvidually. Like if there will be 10  20?. I dont need exact just aproximately?,Well for a 4s(more electronics accept 4s voltage) and say you have 1000 mah cells and you wanted a 2000mah battery’s you would need 8 cells. Two for each group in series because it would be a 4s 2p battery. Cells in parallel increase capacity in series they increase voltage
That does seems as big i mean :D. But i think 2000mah if alot for me. It would be charged same as lipo batteries but different voltage?,"Not really. I want to make a 4200 mah li ion pack And the cells are cheap as well. You can get one 4200 mah cell for 5$. So you can charge a lot of batteries 10 batteries :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: Remember though one cell is 1s alone I would watch some videos about it Ye ye thanks for help :) they are fine, but diy will always give the best performance for lr i just dont have any background with electronics and am not confident in myself whatsoever to build myself a drone. im getting goggles x for sure so im definitely going walksnail i just dont know what to do, diy or pre built You should watch joshua bardwells tutorial on building its actually easier then it looks and if u still think you want more help you could go with his kit if u still want to do diy. As long as u can follow instructions the hardest part will be learning to solder properly u could buy some practice boards and also see how u do. Has anyone here  modded  there integras so they can use patch etc some pretty helpful videos and it looks fun to do but I'm not sure if it's worth it"
Can anyone help me with my O3 footage?,alright thank you. i got some months to figure it out. any idea if this is good and if i could possibly lower the cost a bit
Can anyone help me with my O3 footage?,"The 4k120 is somehow encoded and I dont know how to work with it now. I need to edit it in my software All the parts look good to me however I would make a post on help with drones hopefully someone with more knowledge can help you there Na it's in this discord a channel where u can post The 4k120 is somehow encoded and I dont know how to work with it now I need to edit it in my software no need to ping me twice the exact same question 10min after...  if I don't answer there is a reason :VeryThis:. Reason: “I dont know” :face_with_tears_of_joy: yah, I have no idea how to work with the o3 And im pretty sure you will never know either… I mean, I could say generic useless crap but last time v-22 got mad at me for that. how do you know Ehh, its fine if you dont know some stuff, no need to try if you wont get invested into it. Average hdzero fan, dw you already told me last time to get walksnail over o3 :chefkiss: well, I don't own the o3, and half of my personnality on this server is my hate  for the o3 Anyways Im not here for help, or to help so Il end this convo by sleeping. Goodnight # in my opinion (I am legally obligated to add this everytime I talk about video systems nowdays) dji sucks and caddx walksnail is better I get it dw dw. But. Others may dont… that's why I add the # in my opinion (I am legally obligated to add this everytime I talk about video systems nowdays) but still try to explain why"
hey is anyone here knowledgeable about elrs?,"yes, don't ask to ask"
Strip it and solder it on the ESC?,"I think you've done well to get 200 euros FPV is so expensive to buy new basically worthless second hand how do you connect motors to a esc if all the wires are black but i mean i am guessing one is + the other is - and the other is the signal wire so how do i know what is what It doesn't matter, left to left, middle wire to middle and right to right. Always make sure middle is middle one okey then thank you for your help no, each wire is a different phase of the motor. they can be connected in any order. the way you wire it up affects the direction of the motor but this can be resolved in software so you should just wire it in the neatest / most robust way possible Oh okey now i understand thank you"
Sounds like it's splitting at the 4GB file size limits?,"The recordings were all not bigger than 2-3gb this still sounds pretty normal. you should be able to join them together in post I see thanks. Well now I only need to fix this encoding thing... Since you clearly want a camera drone, I would recommend you head over to #camera-drones to narrow down the selection since it's more specialized in this class of drone"
@Mopatop Would you know why I cant open my footage in my editing software?. Its hevc coded,"sorry, not really my area. but my guess would be that you don't have the codecs installed or your editing software doesn't support the video format. or it could be corrupt Premier does support hevc"
"Right, so naturally, I assumed based on your reference to that project that you want to build your own FC. Because why bother mentioning it otherwise?","can i fly a drone with out a flight controller It's completely impossible im fiddling around lol Drones are not naturally stable platforms, and *require* constant changes to each rotor's output to keep them stable there was one guy who used a gyro sensor Perhaps you don't know what a flight controller is i do but i think its possible to use a gyro sensor and a nodemcu to make ur one fc So. You'll be building your own flight controller i asked if it was possible to do tht, ur reply was no , so i just googled about it and saw some whaky ass guy use a gyrometer and a nodemcu esp8266 to make it his fc i thought anyone here knew abt it and could tell me more. yea i understand"
Best battery choice for a 3 inch running on 4S?   190g without battery.. Can't really decide between 850 or 650mAh,"I use 850mah on my 3.5""   it's sub 250."
7+ minutes.. Nurk proves its possible with this.. https://youtu.be/-ri4XpW9iIc?si=pUHguJLjn6T6MW2d. He said they made a drone that checks most every box. And gets ridiculous flight times.,"You can fly for a really long while with anything so long has you use adequate batteries And do a flat eco+ flight I guess you should see his review.. Hopefully these are adequate :KEKw: Well, like I said, he just slapped on a li-ion. And he over discharged the cells OK. Would a video of me doing 7+ mins with it count.. Anyway, I just told what he did. Checks all the boxes, sub 250, good for long range too. when using a external ESC do i wire the cap to the esc or to the battery inputs. the speedybee renders show on esc inputs but i thought you put it on the battery lead no putting it on the battery lead makes it nearly useless. it goes on the esc ok got it. what does it do exactly. i know it made video better for analogue. is it just filtering the signal input for a cleaner input for esc It filters your power, this is useful for analog video of course I will bet you my entire drone that you don't have a 4s sub250 that runs for 8 mins ( on a normal lipo) but also for your gyro and all other components I'll seriously pay for international shipping. This case is now closed But I do plan on building a sub250g 5"" that should be rather good at lr with a li-ion. Oh, I forgot, my 3"" toothpick flies for 9min of a freestyle battery If, ifs and buts, were candy and nuts While doing some fast flight. And it gets 12min with 2 batteries in parrallel. (but without the fast flight)"
So..this is a 3.5 inch 850mah battery?,"there is a build with walksnail on rotorbuilds using a 4"" toothpick frame that gets 11min of freestyle. Missed it by :pinching_hand: much"
do you have the link ?,"ye i can try and find it you where really close yeah my current toothpick build with 4"" 550mah with an O3 get 6min. naked would increase that calm down im switching this summer I've never used the o3. Honestly, I like my analog stuff more than my dji stuff disagree id pick hd any day. As for dji vs others thats something im willing to accept. When i got into HD walksnail just wasnt where I wanted them to be. Waiting for the new goggles supposedly to launch I see a lot of people that start fpv with elrs and digital stuff. I would never be able to go back to analog. I haven't tried really really good analog though I personally think every pilot should learn how to deal with failsafe and video loss i started on analog and once i got my hd set it was a game changer. Lost more builds to video issues on analog than hd I'm more about ride a longs with spectators. @Turd Ferguson https://rotorbuilds.com/build/31328 oh don't worry I sure got my fair share of that even with ELRS and Walksnail lol descriptions been changed but he still says 8min I am surprisingly good at flying blind now"
emilia is ws your main video system?,"I would rather get others  into.fpv over my digital goggles.. But, not everyone likes to show others what we see.. I'm more about preservation at this point. that's basically just a tp4 Unfortunately I don't think aymeric owns that :thinking_face:"
what is the ws 1s board like?,"Is he does though, my money goes where my mouth goes :slightly_smiling_face: probs not but i just wanted to show you its possible That's fucking rad too. They should be really awesome, some have QC issues and die though. is that a ws thing or a product issue Walksnail thing currently, but they're trying to get back on top of not having QC issues does ws have product heirarchy in terms of transmission or are they all the same. I mean like O3 VS O4. i saw the moonlight kit but it seems its just ws on 4k. nothing range wise Just broke my radio was looking at a radio master xt12 but dont know if i need an extra module for ELRS and are unsure if i should get it as im new to fpv and have no clue how to flash fimware onto recievers Just asking for advice Range has nothing to do with what product specifically, more with the output power and antennas as in how O3 transmission is inferior to the O4 system. Does ws have different transmission versions or are they all the same It'd be best to get something else from RadioMaster. say a Boxer or a Pocket. and internal ELRS would be nicest so essentially the O4 has a higher output to the O3 I don't know what weird stuff they do on DJI"
also do you think walksnail will lock you out from using older goggles/vtx in the future?. one thing i was curious about,"Nothing holds back the Walksnail system in terms of range other than the VRX, which they'll upgrade at some point this year. I think they maybe would eventually, but that's probably in a very long time from now. I'm not worried about it really. Is it long enough to the point where you dont have to worry or the fact that its easy to swap the vrx module to support newer systems It's pretty easy to keep compatibility with older VTXs I'd imagine. so unless they do a complete overhaul with different chip brands and such. which, like, no"
chances of that are slim?,and I mean otherwise the worst that happens is you probably have to upgrade your goggles for the price of 1 vtx or whatever. that's my best guess. The TX12 is outdated and looks like a pool noodle
fair enough does the boxer and pocket have ELRS baked in with no need for an extra module?,yes you can buy them all with elrs
alr do you have a recomended reciever to go with them?,Happymodel EP1 or whatever would be the cheapest for a bigger drone. if you can spare the money and space I'd get like a BetaFPV SuperD or RP4TD
Do you guys know from where the droneshops buy their stuff from?,Suppliers and directly from the manufacturers
Like If I would like to sell Mobula 6 2024 then I have to write to happymodel?,depends on your country having proper consumer laws
"You have to be a retailer in order to purchase wholesale from a manufacturer, especially imported goods. Do you have a retail business that's all registered and legal?",or a lucky person on taobao and alibaba lol Psh I guess. That's sketch af though and you have to buy at least a handful
You are getting that kind of time?. What are you flying here?. This is a 850 mah lipo too?. I guess the good Ole days of 3.5 mins are past us.,"650mAh. Volador VX3. but that's just crusising. max speed of 30km/h I can get 7 minutes on a 650mAh on my 3.5"" I think I got like 12 on a 930mAh but I wasn't just cruising. definitely not a build for efficiency or weight either hey guys why is it giving me the Caution warning at the bottom. I have the sliders off and use numbers Save your numbers, reset the sliders, then re-enter your numbers. See if it's still there. Honestly your D-gain *is* pretty high IME aigh ill poke around. flies okay around the room but ive yet to take it out"
i can charge 720mah 1s batts on .7 amps right?,"That would be a charge rate of 1C, yes"
what would happen if i were to charge a 450 mah at .7 amps?,"The battery would like it less than being charged at 1C, and ultimately you'll get fewer recharge cycles out of that battery, but other than that nothing should happen Most 1s batteries are already hv, so they already have a shorter lifespan, so charge at 1/1.5c to not damage them even faster my ESC has a marking on eahc of the three pads labelled C B and R does it matter which way i solder it but was wondering if something would happen if i were to forget to change the amps like they aint gonna explode For a brushless motor, the 3 pads are just different phases. And you can change them in software ye I just rather not swap them once its installed. Unless you use some really old hardware or software you should be able to just change the motor direction in betaflight You can also change the direction of a motor by physically swapping any of the two phase lines, if all else fails. Nah they won't explode if you forget and charge the 450s at 0.7A thats what I mean the thing is the ESC cannot be reached once assembled so i was wondering if i could guaranteed get it right first time.. but ill solder it as is and then see what happens If it's any modern BLH_S or BLH32 ESC, then you can use inav passthrough to configure it"
"also on a blheliS ESC connected externally to a fc for a fixed wing, how do i change the sec setting is it the same as on a regular stack. or the esc configurator?. ive got the hglrc 30A blheli-S. running DHSOT",Yea for BLH_S you'd use the esc-configurator webapp
hey I burnt one of my motors which was 1404 4000kv  and the closest I can find a new one is 1404 3800kV :S I wanted to PID tune the quad so I am not sure if that 200kV will make a difference ?,"Hi! Im wondering if there is anyone here who is pretty experienced with drones from the IoT / Industrial aspect, and simulations, using ros-gazebo, sensors, cameras, object detection, aruco codes, etc.  Or if im at the wrong place with my interest, please direct me to the right one. got some experience :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. however, this server is more about FPV and other types of consumer drones. you'll find the help you need on the ROS discord Oh, okay, thanks :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
hmm I may use the chance and replace the motors than any suggestion for 3 inch 4s quadmulla split f3 ?,every motor model reacts differently and the flight controller might really not be able to properly filter out different types of noise and vibration. i love my Flyfish 1404 4500KV. i use them on a Volador VX3
how about HGLRC SPECTER 1404 4800KV ?. too much kv ?,"up to 5000 you're good. some even do 5500 they are kind of cheap :face_with_tongue: flyfish is not avialable in Poland :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: trust me. you'll spend more money in the end. i had some happymodel motors before and the magnets were glued to the bell with spit, most likely. every light crash, one of the magnets would come off. or something. i just couldnt stand it. wasting so much time and money on new motors or repairing the old ones the flyfish ones are really great. as in. i broke 2 arms on my drone when i hit a pole, and the first hit was right in the motor. it's still spinning as nice as day 1 on my drone"
I'm reading this guide on how to add a speedometer to an RC but I thought FCs had GPSes builtin? Or am I just remembering wrong lol,why would a flight controller have a giant gps chip and an extra clock and then a giant gps antenna on it
?. Im throwing it already,I'm answering your question Oh. But it still spins. Even if i take off standing. Like if i pull the throttle while its in my hand it wants to spin. I already tried resetting. And motors are correctly positioned. I believe
no space?. money?. antenna covering entire thing?. inside of frame where no gps signal will be received nicely?,"why are you acting so hostile about this. all i did was ask a question and you're acting like im a dumbass for not knowing the answer what. I answered your question. I didn't imply anything about you or act like there was anything about you. I'm just plainly putting just about no effort into answering the question, hence it was split into multiple messages. but GPS chips are really big and it'd be hard to fit on even a 30x30 stack, and then you need the UFL and clocks and stuff. It'd just be incredibly hard to do versus having a module that you can comfortably place anywhere. It'd also be a pretty niche thing to put on there I think. would be cool though"
Any harm in putting E6000 around your usb c connection on the fc? Just to gibe a bit more durability,you don't really have to. the usb port is safe inside the frame
did you fly with something attachted in the usb port ?,I have another drone with the same fc. Just want to prevent the same. if the little legs are well soldered on it should just pop out Nah it happened casually taken out the cavle after betaflight updates.
But could you spread some e6000 over the connections?,"not inside the port. if you don't get any inside the port won't care. if you get some inside, well now it's going to be a touch harder to communicate to the fc Yes :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:  ofc. Was just thinking on the outskirts of the usb c over the solder joints.. Ye all the solder for the legs is stil on the fc. Think it was a bad solder job. you should really check if the solder joints on the usb port are good. cause on the picture you send it's like there never was any If i had the correct tools it would easily. Go back on. Pads are all intact. Ye it was lacking serious solder. Ty for the assistance. I think on the other fc which are the same I'll e6000 maybe solder it better before putting glue on it I've ordered a new fc. I don't have the means to solder that back on. adding solder on the legs on the underside of the fc isn't particularly hard. you just add a tiny bit of solder on these on the under side of the fc. but there is often components right next to the usb, so only do it if  there isn't anything in the way Got all those little legs need to be soldered back as well. I have a question: I bought a Drone with a TBS Receiver on it, but I want to use the Cadxx as my Receiver. I know that i need to resolder 2 wires, but which ones I am a bit worried that I make a mistake here"
some1 ghsted. can u ans the q?,there should be lables in the battey bay. and on the batteries
positive with negative right?>,"itsi just liek you would plug in a AA battery w ans. thanks i got it it was you who ghosted, looking at the server logs, if you wanna do that you can do it in another server Can someone please help me figure out the connection between FSi6S RX and Hobbywing Xrotor f4 g2 FC. I initially used the RX3 pin and used PWM and ibus in the output option but it won't work. how about next time you just @ someone at leave it at that rather than trying to delete it to save face. you need to still use an Sbus pin i believe either that or you may need to configure that uart to accept ibus/sbus. I mean next time it happens we'll prolly just mute you or ban you tbh, if you have such a need for special treatment, well give it to ya if I was mad i woulda just muted you instead of answering your question. either way, i hope your stuff is working now, happy droning! Just found a phone repair shop on my high street. Said he can do it for £10 that will do! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I forsee that guy getting very rich off you from all the soldering lol I can solder! Just not the usb c!"
This sounds like a battery either wasn't charged properly or failed. Which one and why?,hey does anyone know how to use a pwm to sbus converter I have Goggles footage but its too big for any of these chats i have a raido which is pwm and a fc with uses sbus
Radios don't just broadcast a PWM signal. Which radio is it?. So upload it to YouTube?,I can DM it to you if you want to
So my usbc fell off my flight controller I've sourced a replacement. Looking the 4 corner pads they look very light on solder. Any harm in just putting some decent solder blobs on those 4 corners?,"Ah, so you're talking about a PWM *receiver*, not a radio. You have my sympathies. A good PWM-SBUS converter should be plug-and-play."
"What version of Betaflight?. Probably no harm, those are ground connections. When you flashed the flight controller, did you include SBUS in the radio protocol build config?","Ye perfect will do that.. They barely look soldered on to me.... Manufacturing solder joints tend to have a lot less solder than we would add ourselves, for a number of reasons that aren't really important to us. To be quite honest, hobbyists tend to use too much solder. When teaching over the internet, we recommend more than is necessary because a little too much solder is a far better outcome than too little. The end result is that this *looks* like it doesn't have enough solder, when in reality it's just fine. Oh fair enough. Ye I guess you got a point every video I ever saw when I started, Nice massive blobs of solder. Yea. In manufacturing they teach you to use enough solder to coat the joint, but not so much that you can't see the impression of the wire or pad that you're soldering. In manufacturing, if it's a round blob, you're just wasting solder. In addition to that, round blobs tend to result in a lot more solder dripping from an iron--when that happens inside a production line, it means an entire series of product can be DOA because someone on the line was accidentally bridging pads or dripping solder in places it shouldn't be Yes, but it's not going to work if you didn't select SBUS when you *flashed the firmware*"
"what is the best electronics prototyping company ? I know pcp way, is there a better one ?",There's also JLCPCB. Pcbway and JLCPCB are probably the two biggest ones
"Hello! Can motors get wet? If I created a vacuumed formed plastic seal around the body of my quad, with an opening for the camera, Would I be able to happily fly in torrential rain without having to worry about the motors getting wet?",Can anyone help me configure my quad with a Fr sky mx receiver it's been so long that I don't remember how to do it anymore
"Just PCB or build too?. I used Dirty PCBs, they are actually fantastic.","Brushless motors are water *resistant*, but not water *proof*. The coils and magnets are fine, and the metal bits are generally aluminum, and titanium, so they're all fine. The only thing to *really* worry about is the bearings, which are generally sealed steel ball bearings. In rain, they'll likely be just fine. You might need to replace them sooner than most people would, but they aren't going to immediately die just from some rain They were simple boards mind"
Any dutch person that I could ask some questions to about flying my drone?,#archived-general-non-english
How can I display my analog feed to my computer or monitor?,"That's great info, thank you! If you goggles have HDMI out, that makes it pretty easy. If they have composite video out, you can get a composite to HDMI converter. If your goggles have neither of those, you can get another analog receiver, and send its output into a composite to HDMI converter"
"I have  AV out,can it desplay analog feed?. And USB A out",AV out is a composite signal
so i can connect it to my TV?. With that thing?,"Was conflicted as I have questions to post it here or there, but I'll move there, thanks! De grease, ca glue and send it or is there better way to patch it up. Mobula 7 I've trusted what you lot say ! ill leave it then. I did have one person reccomend just using e6000 on the smaller joints at the back. Ill just do that."
"How hard is it to swap frames? Like if I break a frame on my mob8, do I need to solder anything or is it just screws?","If you're swapping to the same frame as a replacement, should be able to just unscrew everything and move it over, no soldering"
Is there any tutorials or should I just wing it?. Or should I say *prop* it. I’m sorry,"Heh. No tutorial needed, just put everything where it needs to go, and be careful not to pull of any wires. Treat it like surgery. Be careful, go slow, and it'll be fine Remember the motor order so you don't mix up where the front is. had one guy do that and tell me he didn't do that after you have CA'd it, wrap a couple layers of toilet paper over the joint (only about 5mm wide strip) then drop CA glue onto it. it'll form into an extra hard reinforcement. take care with the prop clearance and don't add too much"
"so no random crap is needed,  like the radio sends pwm waves and the receiver is ment to do tht is what ur telling? or if i bind another receiver with is sbus it should work fine with fs ct6b radio","The radio is sending a signal to the receiver over whatever garbage protocol Flysky developed for it. The *receiver* takes that signal and makes it into PWM outputs. Those PWM signals need to be connected to an SBUS converter so that you can get an SBUS signal to the FC. *Or* you could just buy a compatible Flysky SBUS receiver that doesn't have any of this PWM crap in the way Aigh will give it a go. As for new  frame i see v3 in stock everywhere but v4, like mine, im having more trouble finding. icc. can i dm u abt the parts and can u tell me if they r compactable Either put the details here or in a #help-with-drones thread so that everyone can benefit from your experience"
"Hello, I can't save PPM as my receiver mode in Betaflight. After selecting PPM and pressing ""Save and reboot"", the receiver mode is reset to ""Serial (via UART)"".

are fixed wing drones essentially camera oriented drones that are seen in first person ?,They can be but aren't necessarily anytime i see someone with them they deck out the camera and always use goggles
What do you mean by decking out the camera?,"just having a good camera. putting a lot of money to the camera. i may be wrong though I mean I put the nice cameras on everything, personally, but I could guess that other fixed-wing FPV pilots are willing to put the nice cameras on an airplane because it's a lot less likely to get destroyed on impact. Again, at least for me, I like to fly my airplanes at altitude, no proximity flying"
"Hello!  I purchased a DJI mini 4 pro yesterday but I had a question regarding the limitations of controlled airspace.  I have attached a picture of a controlled airspace above the Rotterdam area. It says the following: ```EHRD ROTTERDAM CTR SUMMARY Red zones are regulated high-risk areas and operation of your drone may be hazardous or prohibited. VERTICAL LIMITS This piece of airspace is in effect between Surface and 3000ft MSL CONTROL ZONE Airspace in which local air traffic control provides clearances, instructions and information to air and ground traffic. To carry out drone flights in a civil CTR you need: - A permit granted by ILT. - Permission from LVNL, after you have reported the drone flight at least 24 hours in advance via GoDrone.  The maximum altitude in a CTR is 120 metres. However, the air traffic controller may order a lower maximum altitude. For object inspections you may fly higher than 120 meters, namely up to 15 meters above the object to be inspected. The only condition is that you have permission from the owner and that the drone remains within 50 meters of the object.  While flying in a CTR, radio communication with the control tower is required. This communication takes place in the English language. For more information on the flight process and radio telephony examples, see: https://www.lvnl.nl/ohd/bijzondere-vluchten/drones/vluchtverloop-en-radiotelefonie  For more information about flying with a drone in the civil CTRs of Schiphol, Rotterdam, Lelystad, Groningen and Maastricht go to: https://www.lvnl.nl/ohd/bijzondere-vluchten/drones. Please contact the local military air traffic control service if you plan to perform a drone flight in the military CTRs of Den Helder, Leeuwarden, Gilze-Rijen, Woensdrecht, Volkel, Eindhoven, Deelen and De Peel. REMARKS It is forbidden for the open category. It is a radio mandatory zone. It is a transponder mandatory zone. ```  So this means I am not even allowed to fly in a field, out in the middle of nowhere, at 10-20 meters high?  The DJI app also has the flight map with less restrictions, why would one follow?",Im getting a drone solely for the cinematic potential. i love photography and quite literally want to take it to new heights. it seems to me I want a hybrid of some sort. itd be awesome to see my footage in first person but theres no reason too if i just get a mavic
"Can you move this to #drone-laws, and just link the page rather than copy/pasting it?","I can tell you right now that fixed-wing *anything* is not great for cine-style footage, way too bumpy and susceptible to wind i definitely dont want one lol. i was just curious there function If you have enough extra resolution on your camera, you can stabilize the footage, but the other problem with filming from an airplane is it *always* **must** be moving forward to stay in the air--you can't hover, you can't turn on a dime, you can't film like you can with a multirotor"
Uhhh you mean a cinewhoop?,"what about a link and the text, it's an interactive map v_v If you just link the map and coordinates then we can find it and see the same thing you're seeing id get a defender 16 to test the potential out. what do u mean though by “you mean a cinewhoop” what comment of mine are you referring to Cinewhoops are meant to be cinematic FPV drones, a blend between camera and fpv acro drones"
oh.. bet lol. people slander them for not being open propped why?. ill probably built my own after too. also why arnt they open propped,"They are protected to keep any accidental bumps around people from turning into lacerations and uncontrolled descents. Cinewhoops are an incredibly popular niche That runs my heating system. Well, it provides room by room control, the backbone runs it's self thats what im getting then! thanks a million. theoretically, it wouldn't be any dark magic to build an FPV-style camera drone. You'd just take a basic DIY multirotor, attach the camera needed for the FPV part, and get a gimbal attached. could either be a gopro or a larger mirrorless or DSLR if you really wanted to, but iirc gimbals for DSLRs or larger are super expensive. or I mean. in true FPV fashion. you could totally DIY the gimbal for much cheaper. just need the knowledge on which type of motors would work best, and some gimbal firmware. the advantage to DJI, though, is that they have equivalently good cameras+gimbals in a much more compact fashion. but you don't get the freedom and DIYableness that those in FPV enjoy. you pay for what you get :PepeShrug: :KEKw:. https://www.instructables.com/DSLR-Brushless-Gimbal/ here ya go lol. would need to find someone to CNC for u. but all in all much cheaper than"

well. that would do it. is your throttle all the way down?,yep. it is. my controller is a radio master pocket. nope :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: can you take a screenshot of this tab in betaflight when i arm it or normally no just the tab with your radio on change channel map to ``AETR1234`` then send a screenshot of that page again. ok hit save and try to arm now. should work k. it works omg thank you soo much :slightly_smiling_face:
Why are the motors like not starting up at full throttle?? This never happened before.

"Depends on a lot more factors than what a single photo can provide, and if you cannot put it back into it's original pack, might has well throw it away, you don't want to have a miss matched cell in your pack. Hey there, does anyone knows the name of the balance plugs we use on our batteries ? The male version, cause I plan on making some really long extension for my balance lead and power lead of my charger so I can charge my jankier batteries inside an ammo box",That's a lipo. With tons of extra foil on the sides
Is there supposed to be continuity between the 5v out and gnd on my FC? Coz all the ones seems to have it even the ones which I did not touch,"no, but if you test it while the FC is powered your multimeter might read it as continuity. but no there should not be continuity between 5V and G. if you are getting that while they are not powered then there might be something wrong with your multimeter or how you are using it"
Is DJI rc3 compatible with old goggles and o3?,"I am using this mode. It beeps when the wires touch It usually helps when you specify the exact goggle model, but afaik the rc3 only works with the g3 that only works with the avata 2 since the rc3 talks via basically Bluetooth to the goggles that then send everything to the avata2 instead of having the radio send stuff to the o3 like the rc2 did"
How do I know what gyro log from my FC partners up with what recording for my quad?,You have to keep track yourself Weird because the logs dont even match up to my recordings. Hard to keep track of that. I have like 83 Flight Log files when I have a total of 9 Flight Recordings on my newly wiped SD cards No point in keeping old logs. I always wipe the cards for the logs and the video recordings all at the same time I didnt keep them. Its just a lot lot
Why are there so many?. What version of betaflight are you using?,That's the configurator. Not the version of betaflight
You mean my fc firmware?,(like say 4.3.0 or 4.5.0). Yeah I did. I didn't ask for betaflight configurator version That's what the version of betaflight means Alright well that's good at least. That doesn't help me explain why you have so many log files though. Hmmm
ok so all 3 of my gnd and 5v pads on the fc seem to be shorted and I am pretty sure its not from the pads being shorted so what else could it be?,If it's just that FC then your vreg has died
"Yeah. Or, some other 5v component has failed short. What happened to it?. Did the magic smoke come out?",well I was changing the fc from one drone to another. and during that I had to resolder the cam vtx rx. and after the first one I tried to check with a multimeter and it showed that there is continuity between the 5v and gnd. but since it was on all the pads including ones I did not touch. I assumed its normal. so I kept going. and then after I was done I plugged in the battery If there is a short anywhere it will show up on all pads. They have the same plane I felt the fc heating up and very small smoke coming so I unplugged it. yee I did not realise that Look for the burned component but this all sounds like the FC is dead none of the components seem burned
Are they still shorted if you desolder everything connected to the FC?,yes. I checked before I started soldering
so is there any hope of repair?,"If you can find out what is smoking and replace it, then it can be saved. But you are in to skilled repair territory here. If it got hot then the chances are it's not the vreg which is dead accha if it is smoking is that like confirmed destroyed or can it be fixed by fixing the short Likelihood is that the component smoking is the one which is shorted. Take some good photos using daylight. If your camera has a zoom it's usually better to take the picture using that, so the whole board is in focus. And post it. Maybe you have dropped some solder somewhere causing the short I feel like the smoking is coming from the underside. like a side of the board where I did not work on this is the most suspecious solder but I did not touch this one from the last build where it worked fine. what are the odds that if I did accidentally short a pad and now I fix the short that the problem goes away yeah if you can fix the short it will be fine. take a picture of the whole board, both sides"
@Mopatop well what do U think?,"well this person has confused their control signal with the video link so this comment isn't worth the crayons it's written with. with that being said, DJI image quality is better than WS and you won't find many people contesting that. WS can be better under certain conditions, and the price + features are also part of the conversation. O3 is just a lot better though. well these certainly look very bad. before you go any further you need to desolder these and clean them up. your iron is way too cold. turn it all the way up, use flux to ball up the solder, remove all the wires, and then test it again the one to the right with purple ik thats not it bcz iv flown with taht one and there isnt any continuity between the purle circle in the left. same with the one of the top ik its not that one since iv flown with it like that. so its the blue one then"
hm alright. what do you mean no continuity?,like in on my multimeter I have a mode where if the two wires touch it makes a noise and when i hold it on those two pads there isnt any noise
Ignoring image quality what would you say about ws in regards to this guys comment on its range and penetration. Is dji that much better to justify paying the extra price?,aahh yeah it's VCC mb. okay well I can't see anything so... I think your only option might be to try plugging it in and seeing where the smoke is coming from
well wont that kill the fc?,"yeah the range and penetration is a lot better on O3. as for the cost, it depends. if you have e.g. high end goggles and you are just buying the VRX, maybe it's not worth it. but if you need to buy WS goggles then the price different isn't really that much"
"well it's dead already right? it smoked the last time you plugged it in. that means it's dead. ideally you would find out where the smoke is coming from and replace the damaged component, but as there is nothing obvious then you don't have anything to lose by plugging it in again.  alternatively maybe someone else will have some different ideas about what to do if you want to hold off. some generally doesn't come from a pad but it could if the pad was bridged with the pad next to it",i have the dji v2 with O3. I dont really want to spend 400-500 on the newer goggles from dji just for them to release a new one and forget about older products as usual. I was really considering ws as i dont mind switching to a complelty new ecosystem since i can actually run HD  on all of my quads and dont have to worry about them losing any support 2 years later but obviosly if range and penetration is a massive issue then........ get ready to see the smoke oke so I think I know which one it is. lemme send pic well WS won't be any better than what you have. my advice is wait and see if an O4 air unit comes out
and if it does come out?,"ok that's the inductor which is part of the voltage conversion. my guess is that there is a short somewhere else which is overloading the 5V rail. first thing you need to do is desolder absolutely everything from the FC, all the wires, even things which were fine before"
"I said here that you need to desolder everything but you said you checked before you started soldering. but you're now telling me that the purple bits I ringed have been flown, which means you didn't desolder everything. correct?","I didnt desolder everything no. I only did the blue bits. but then after deosldering I checked. I have a feeling when i desoldered it there might have been some left. also desoldered the vcc and rx ports aka everything on the left side that's annoying, because it looks like you have bridged pads, and if you had actually desoldered everything we might have been able to save the inductor. anyway - desolder everything and check agian for continuity and check that there are no bridged pads. use flux and turn your iron up I think im gonna need a new iron coz I used mine at max power today. cna u reccomend some cheap ones to answer your question, inductors are common and can be replaced. but - you will need more than just an iron to do it. sometimes mobile phone repair shops are happy to do it for you. the same applies to pretty much any repair you would need to do. Pinecil well how do I find out what inductor it is and where to get it"
"I'm torn between building a 3.5"" sub 250 4s (don't think 6s is feasible at that weight) or building a 3.5"" that is not sub 250 but surely 6s. I already have an o3 air unit so thats fixed. And I'm based in europe (switzerland) and even though I don't think the authorities really enforce the rules regarding  flying not sub 250 self built in residential areas, so that would be a plus for sub 250 3.5"". But a not sub250 would be more durable, probably have a longer flight time and be more powerful. does anyone have any recommendations?","it's a massive step up over O3. like.. way more than V2 -> O3.. V2 -> O3 -------------> O4 (according to mad's tech) They're describing that there's very obviously something wrong with their gear, Walksnail doesn't just drop connection randomly and definitely not line of sight. My pair of goggles is faulty and I'm getting them repaired but even with that I don't have issues like that."
v2 being the original air unit?. hows your range and reliability compared to what he is saying?,"let's find the fault first. but... local electronics stores / ebay / depends on your country. yeah DJI for now is a little better in penetration because of their diversity. but if you have a proper Walksnail antenna setup there's absolutely zero issues. the thing is Walksnail is often misunderstood because they think it works like DJI, it doesn't yet. It's more like an analog mix receiver, it's not diversity If you have 2 patches you might as well have 4 basically. people like from the comment you shared will your goggles eventually be able to support full diveristy in the future. or is it a new hardware thing The goggles X are upgradable, that's the nice part. the new receiver they're working on should be proper diversity thats the one you said is coming later this year right well, that's what caddx is saying at least im really excited to see how the new ws vrx performs against the O4 and how big of a gap they will have It's hard to know since we already know the O4 will be able to do 60mbps, we don't know anything about the new Walksnail stuff the biggest attraction about ws is the transparency and cost savings. I can finally run hd on my whoops without having to worry about the company forgetting the older hardware but comments like the one i sent shake my view every now and then yeah Walksnail needs to compete harder in the areas where they're not directly fighting DJI"
what areas do you thnk that is?. aside from the moonlight sutff,"Things like tinywhoops, low light stuff, BNF stuff. They have so many things they can improve in that DJI simply can't"
dji will never attempt as lighter vtx?,"No point. Why would they. Tiny market held down by Ws and HDz yeah I don't think they ever will. The reason why DJI works better commercially is because they have the money to make super cheap goggles and get people into the system Heheh tiny market :winking_face: ye biggest choice for whoops HD is the ws and HDZ HDz whoops are cool af. Especially 75mm but also the signal is better for compared to analog and HDZero because digital systems like DJI can handle things like interference waaaay better which is an issue in commercial shoots and since Walksnail is a mix receiver, you basically either have a patch or an omni and that might simply not work for every shoot DJI goggles are £200 ish, walksnail and HDz are £550 I'm sure if someone went and compared the penetration and such with *just* patches the systems would be very close in performance i thought it was the other way round. Dji goggles 3 is 550 and ws is like 350"
talking about V2 vs WS though right? O3 is way better for penetration than both of them,"I don't know much about the O3 so possibly. I'm just trying to demonstrate that there's nothing wrong with the penetration Walksnail can offer... as long as you can just use patches alone yeah I think they are fine. but he already has V2 air units so.... probably not worth buying WS Srry £300 ish for DJI V2s and atleast £500 for walksnail and HDz. Oh yea I wayyy prefer walksnail The integras lack features and easy antenna switching and such, but they're dirt cheap because DJI can make them be. The Goggles X are probably the cheapest digital goggles otherwise, 450 usd. I am selling v2 either way the question is whenever I do sell them should I sell the o3 as well and enter ws or keep playing the game with newer dji goggles depends on your goals and depends on if you care about the company behind it I don't want to keep buying goggles every 2 years when dji abandons them. I don't shoot commercially and it's more of a hobby than anything but I do take it seriously so I want somewhat decent video setup. I have maybe 7 builds and I don't really like the idea of fitting a dji air unit to every one. Ws however solves this since as a company they are better in terms of community intergration and lower entry cost and maintenance cost. But that being said the relative performance between each other matters."
but the original goggles still work with every air unit to date?. they don't make them any more but they are not abandoned,"the O4 has a lot of speculation around abandonment. especially since stuff has been weird with the avata 2 yeah I agree I doubt that the O4 units if they ever existed would work with original goggles. anyway if I had DJI goggles right now... it doesn't make any sense to buy WS. it's more of a sidegrade in my opinion. wait and see what happens with the O4 units and then buy into that when they appear. the difference with O4 is crazy If you do really want to do something that Walksnail excells at like tinywhoops or long range and such it's a different question of course or even 2"" 2.5"" stuff Gezus it came out like a month ago :face_with_tears_of_joy: I hope the O4 will be able to connect to goggles 2 The v2 don't support O4. so even if the o4 came out I'd have to sell the v2 since it won't work with it. At which point transferring to ws would be easier since every new model I'd only have to swap the vrx on it not a whole goggles for 500. V1 goggles don't work with o3"
so if your running elrs on your transmitter you need anotherr rx tx setup for telemetry for something like arudpilot to understand?,"Yes. Unless you have Gemini you need 2 pairs of TX and RX, one for elrs control and one for mavlink Where can I check in which region which drone shop is available because I think there was a website for it whats better to get a cam with 4:3 or 16:9"
exactly this one thank you and btw. did these shops (which are shown when you search a product) pay anything to be on that list ?,Doubt it. Pretty sure is just a curation of all the sites alright thank you for your help i prefer 4:3 since you generally get a wider fov
whaaat. you mean the word machine that literally just spits out words in relation to what you put in isn't trustworthy?,"I want to buy a second hand gopro for fpv and I found a really good deal for a gopro 12 but it has this text in teh description and I dont know what it means: CHDHX-121-CN It's the manufacturer's model number code I really want to make my status a command, but then I'd just be a jerk chat gpt said its a model for china market thats why Im not sure Chat GPT doesn't know anything newer than Sept 2021. And even then it's wrong 50% of the time I *really* ***really*** don't understand why people trust it so much"
Lipo storage voltage is 3.8 right?,Hmm i seen a battery lipo and those was 3.7 volts. I am not sure what it was
did you set serial rx to the correct uart? on the ports tab. (the one you soldered to). and on the receiver tab did you set it to serial CSRF,I need help with getting my drone to work with my remote I move my sticks and the bars on the receiver tab don’t move it would help telling us what you have Sorry. I have the pocket ELRS radiomaster. And I have the solo good ELRS receiver that's a fake elrs receiver. did you bind them Yes the led stays blue did you set up betaflight Yes i did i just don’t know what to do in it. I’ve been looking at videos but I can’t find any that I can understand I’m new to this hobby Yes but the problem is that it says usb vs. Or sorry vc something like that I’ll show you a picture yes you don't need to touch that. you just press the serial rx button for the correct number and then press save Ohh okay but what now no. don't flip the configuration/msp. only the serial rx. and then press save
But isn’t that my uart?. So rx for Vcp?,"Do I choose rx for the top one The configuration/msp is to set a uart as something you can configure Betaflight with, like the usb port. Serial RX is to set a uart as a receiver. if you soldered your receiver to TX2 and RX2 you would flip only the serial rx for uart 2 you can't do that. they need to match I can’t. Oh sorry rx1 and tx1"
you're telling me you have 5 uarts and you can't match tx and rx on a single one?,"then flip serial rx on uart 1. and don't touch the configuration/msp one. then press save Okay it worked now what On the top right, select Serial and CSRF in the drop down menu"
is your receiver powered?,Ohh shoot sorry. Okay. I powered it is the stuff on the screen moving No. Nothing is moving. Idk why :frowning_face:
Did you solder tx to rx and rx to tx?,try turning model match on and off. while the drone is on and bound Still not working. I’m so confused please help me figure this out
C?. I don’t see it anywhere on here is it in a specific spot?,"you aren't bound. that - in the top right corner will be a C when paired with a receiver you should center your trims, unrelated to this issue but will seem like an issue later"
Okay I got ya. So now what?,"can you open your model menu and take a photo of page 4, should be called inputs somehow you fucked up your elevator input the one between Ail and Thr is blank. it should be Ele long press on it and click edit. with the roller wheel button Yeah. Match the settings This wont fix the other issue, but now when the other issue is fixed youll be able to use pitch I can’t get Ele on source"
did you set it on input first?,"if you scroll all the way to the left it should be the second option rud is first, ele after it needs to be ele, you already have rud I don’t have that one ok, you can back out of this menu then. Open your system settings and go to page 6, hardware. run the calibration Yes not working still. What are pots"
the twisty things. idk if the pocket has any spinning/twisting things. so moving the sticks doesn't do anything?,"yeah that counts as a slider, I don't think you have any pots. pot is short for potentiometer So I move my sticks but it’s stuck on the picture I sent. You. It just says move sticks. But it does nothing"
can you back out of the calibration and take a pic of your hardware menu?,Ohhh wait it says sf is pot Yeah but if the sticks arent moving something is scuffed. Wait actually it might be ok
Fr. ?. This important too?,"go back into calibration when it says move sticks and pots and switches you need to 1. move sticks in + pattern, up down, left right 2. switch all the switches through all their positions 3. spin the spinny shit 5. click to proceed It does nothing. I’d send a video but I don’t have nitro. Wait mine show dashes on each of them"
bad antennas?. https://www.racedayquads.com/products/speedybee-5-8ghz-sma-antenna-v2-2-pack-rhcp?keyword=sma%20antenna,I don’t think so. I just can’t get my drone to pair to my pocket ELRS radiomaster. Like bad antenna inside the drone or the remote. Hello I still need help https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/binding/ It’s already binded just no bars in the receiver tab move
These traces act as antennas right ?,"Idk what were looking at, but probably"
"Try to Hook up a new betafpv woop, new to fpv and im loosing rssi like it isnt anything to my tranis q X7, anyone know what i may be doing wrong?",That's just kind of how FrSky is.... that's why we recommend new radios and ExpressLRS
That reciever cant connect to a fr sky r9m correct? (Sorry if dumb question hella new,"r9m is also outdated. the qx7 and r9m are at least 4-5 years outdated at this point I believe. but no, it can't"
So at this point im just kinda sol?,"yeah. just look at if your antennas and such are all good. can't do more than that really. if you can return any of it that'd be good, an ELRS radio can be found for as low as 60 dollars in the US I mean i am flying multiple drones with no issues so this might be an intena issue because im failsafing 3 ft away"
How safe is it having the XT 60 like that?. also @Mopatop u were right I did have the 5v and gnd shorted and after I fixed the short the board started to work fine. ig I got very lucky,just get some zipties. and make sure you're flying props out
kk. but how would props out help tho?,think of the direction it'd be getting hit. same for everything else. props out is just better
Are the batteries charged?,"They should be, but i will try to charge them in the goggles again. The battery symbol is also kinda glitched. Let me try to shoot a picture. This one- when i did use 2s batts or the power bank i havent seen the battery symbol and i did use a charger to charge the battery before so idk. But i will leave the battery in the goggles now charging and hoping that it will fix it I had a problem(https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1239250743337287750/1239250743337287750) with my Drone and asked the seller how to solve it. They said ""Change the power cord and remote control settings to match those in the manual"" but I dont know what they mean can someone help"
"I see those boards everywhere from many vendors, is that a no go?",Should i get anything specific for 1s jstph 450mah packs in terms of charger or just grab whatever is cheapest on amazon. I do have charging board but my large charger struggles with those small ones and takes forever to trickle them to full You can either get a vifly whoopstor v3 or have something that will kill your batteries
https://tenor.com/view/lol-rofl-lmao-funny-laugh-gif-4993318. Did your dog take it off?,Na my pet rock nicked them ah great glad to hear it
"Yea my friend told me that, but what happens if i do? I havent done it just wondering",Just double checking that you know not to power them on without antennas It could overheat the goggles. They probably have some sort of safety built in but it’s best practice to have them on Ohh i thought they where for signal ngl They are for signal as well. I like to think of it like shooting a gun with the barrel plugged. Nowhere for all the rf to go so the energy just makes tons of heat
Im selling a drone with a vista which has wtf os on it to somone with the integras. Can I just update it or do I have to deinstall something?,Pic below for visual example  Im looking to buy the cobra X googles but not sure the best antennas to use with the module. Im considering the maple leaf with a lolipop. But before i spend my hard earned money id like to know if there are other antennas better worth it. Ive seen some long spiral ones on a YT vid (they look piccolos special beam cannon). Throw me some suggestions tho
if you wanna get better value and better antennas then don’t get on amazon they are way overpriced. US?,Buy from a US FPV store. and get actual antennas. TrueRC or Prodrone.pl. will be way cheaper. have you looked in your osd on why it won't arm is showing cpu overload :man_shrugging: well then your cpu is overloaded. screenshot your motor tab in betaflight. i needed the bottom and top bar too. your cpu load is quite high. don't know why
most likely the khz. but uh I kind of expected that to be in that tab. might be on the pid tuning tab?,Picture was for refrence. Also every fpv store is backing ordering these specific items :face_with_diagonal_mouth: Rotor riot/getfpv those are the only ones i currently shop from. Plus i work at amazon and get discounts so its about the same price anyway here https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1241081146901663805 probably isn't. Check the main tab for PWM or PID loop. looptime. it should be a khz value like 8khz
yeah just search all of them until you find it. <https://www.racedayquads.com/products/skyzone-cobra-x-v2-diversity-5-8ghz-fpv-goggles-w-60-fps-dvr?keyword=cobra%20x>. RDQ has them,"<https://pyrodrone.com/products/skyzone-cobra-x-fpv-goggles-with-steadyview-module>. i'll just. grab a drone and look for you. It's on the configuration tab Including shipping cost it averages to the same price (with my discount) on amazon i have no shipping fee nope. shipping is free. so Oh ok ill check into it. Appreciate that buddy lower it, save and then you should be able to fly"
should i decrease it?. 3.2? like you have?,"uh just a lower value i have no clue why mine is that low Most FPV stores will do free shipping at around a hundred dollars on top of that shipping is usually only 10~ dollars. so unless you desperately need something super fast, use an FPV store"
Anyone able to suggest me a way how do i get out batteries on radiomaster from that case?,on the boxer I assume you slide the cover downwards. like on other radiomaster radios oh just force. can't do much else
:/. Heating up case isnt good idea ye?,no you should be able to just take them out but arm and beeper is stll not working. crash flip shows warning then turn off your crash flip switch yes i meant it like crash flip is working but arm and beeper not
Oh nice took em our without much force found a strategy. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) batteries are 3.9v charge em?,li ion goes to 4.1. use the li ion mode on your charger. not the lipo mode. and charge at 0.5C it doesnt beep and doesnt arm
What is the storage voltage and what is the empty?,3.6v if i am right(storage) yes but what does the osd say when you try to arm that one can be ignored
I have 3.9 so i can use em ye?,yeah but it shouldn't prevent arming. so is there another message
is your throttle all the way down?,:thinkies:. I'm sus. did you make sure you replugged the battery after unplugging from usb
yes. cant be problem in the mods?,when you flip aux 1 it goes to the middle right lol well that's the problem. move the giant yellow bar to the right. so that the little yellow bar is inside the range of it
okay. and what about beeper?,"do the same for beeper. basically when the little bar is lined up with the big one it's ""on"""
I may charge liion on hota d6 pro ye?,"and when not it's ""off"" yeah if you select the li ion mode that is weird, when i arm push throttle up and then down. it doesnt go down do you have props on. and is it not constrained by evil hands that's the problem. it's basically trying to correct itself. but it can't. so it tries harder. and harder. and harder"
"okay. and i have one last question. question that is every time problem for me, props should be like this?",you want props out. so the other way. that's the general rule
There are 2 Blacks and 1 Red so 2 grounds?,"It's a balance connector I think on the main configuration tab of Betaflight or whatever you're using you can set when it should beep. But I think you should keep it like that. say the LR drone crashes and the battery disconnects momentarily, you want it to beep What shoud i connect where Yeah but for some reason my motors move and they beep when I turn it on I just checked bkheli 32 forward is up to date on my ESC @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) shoud i connect Black to - or. I am not sure  abt  this yes. but also accidentally plugging it in wrong won't damage it. your charger can handle that and will tell you if it's wrong"
does that say Lithium Ion or LiLon?,Quick note.. check the cells charging spec. If that hasn't happened already
some lithium ion cells can't take 1c I assume?,"most if not all can't. I said 0.5C to be safe, might need to be lower Most modern ones can take 1C charging, but for many it's not ideal 1 times the capacity of the battery Ohhhh. Okey lets now hope it wont blow for a 2000mah battery that's 2 amps. but yeah charge at 1 amp in this case. ah you need to make an adapter to be able to charge through just a balance plug"
Did you plug in both ends?. The balance plug and the power plug?,.. That is all i have Only balance plug there https://www.progressiverc.com/products/2s-jst-xh-charge-balance-cable. trivial soldering job The charger needs both plugs to be plugged in. The xt60 wires up essentially to the two outer pins of the balance plug I give em rm boxer will charge em :dotted_line_face:. Thanks for help. Ig :D
Can someone please answer this?,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) rip 1 battery :smiling_face_with_tear:. I pushed hard with screw driver. Dont ask why...
"Hey there, is an hq 8x3.7x3 and a 6s 3000mah pack enough for a 8"" macro quad ?","hello. i am upgrading my drone from quad to hexacopter and the motors i am using right has a newer model claiming to produce 20% more power using the same power as the older version, so my question is would that cause any issues as i would be only adding 2 new motors and rest would be the old ones motor is Sunnysky x2814 900KV Well, I just want to let you know going from quad to hex isn't an automatic upgrade, and basically you will be limited to the power generated by the least powerful motor. And it will hurt the fly performance a bit too"
Do you think is this any good?,"no. get a known brand. those are extremely fake Yeah nope. Get samsung. Well, in your case it would be worth doing. 6 motors will produce more thrust than 4 and thus will be more efficient than 4 for heavy loads i am implementing computer vision so a stable camera is also important Which is why we use x8 for cinelifters. Might want to look at an x8. You will be able to use bigger props than hex in a smaller frame. And you will have more thrust, and have all motors spin bi blades for more efficiency currently using 11inch props. s500 frame X8 on 11"" bi blades could work pretty well for agriculture. I know DJI has a huge x8 agricultural drone there is budget constraint as the project is university funded Idk how much motors in this size cost, but adding 2 motors and a little carbon fiber plate shouldn't be that expensive Upgrading to hexacopter is within the budget including the onboard computer, it was the x8 system that would be out of the budget. Anyways, thanks for your suggestion. Ok, well in this case hex should work fairly well"
Can I display altitude with my FCs onboard Barometer? Will that be acurate?,"It's one of the first settings in OSD section. I don't know how accurate it technically is but seems pretty spot on for me flying around the backyard And thats with the barometer right. Yes. I can't remember if it's labeled altitude or barometer in osd, don't think I needed to set anything else up for it."
"Guys my radiomaster zorro doesnt charge past 8 with stock batteries via usb c, what am I missing there? Not a big deal to carry small lipo but Id want that to be charged full before going out",I check it whenever I work on it again or clean it so I guess weekly or ever other day.. I also check my wiring there any my plugs.. Always good to check your hardware between flight sessions to avoid non wanted trouble
I mean how dirty would a mini 4 get compared to a freestyle fpv quad?,"Mine did some lawn mowing yesterday and got my entire quad full of gras. If you dont crash or hit any trees it shouldnt be that dirty and honestly I barely clean my FPV quads, it's hard to do so Exactly. I like cleaning mine just for looks and feel. the looks on mine are scuffed already haha thats cute tho. I like keeping mine all black is there anyone able to help me with an issue with wireless trainer with edge tx black is waaay too boring for me. I like bright colors. if my SO ever wants a quad of her own it'd probably be black and dark red I'd imagine. don't ask to ask that's what we're here for - though you might want to make a thread in #help-with-drones if it's a longer issue. oh wait this is already a help channel :KEKw: so yes also this Im asking if there is someone that is specificly well versed in using edge and the trainer function."
"I've done it before, what's the problem?",i just posted in help with drones if you dont mind taking a look. I would like to buy 10 inch 3 blades props for my quad in Berlin. Need them NOW. Tell your price in DM
In getting a new antenna for my drone which 1 should I get?,lollipops. cherries. flyfish. doesn't reallz mTter
"only possible thing is maybe the battery if they're just using dumb lipos. possibly you could just glue a fpv camera to it, that works, but is... suboptimal compared to an actual fpv quad or camera drone. you could check if the antenna is cut to the wrong length but not much else. _ what are you looking to achieve?","Is just a hobby for learning, like to thinker with stuff. Want to see how far i can push something using as little as possible, is fun. I guess if you have microsoldering skills you could try to reflash the chips... even our little fpv drones are basically made of the same components. the toy drones are just made worse our flight controllers have the pads broken out in a useful way, for example"
"That leads to madness, tried once, not again.. Anything that can make then any less worse and still be reasonable?","replacing FC, ESC, motors, battery, and frame"
Ain't that pretty much a new drone?,"yes. the thing is unlike hobby drones nothing is modular so you basically need to replace everything some are ""surprisingly modular"", you can change  and fit pretty much anything in the board if has the same type of connector."
"I guess flight controller and esc would work, if it's a brushless drone, there aren't many good brushed ESCs.. like?","e58, e88, e99 and the rest of the E generic family. You can just open it up, change the camera module, and motors for anything that plugs in. Problem is knowing what will or not work between each other, since there is a lot of variations. you can replace the motors but there's no point because they're brushed, you won't be able to get anythign better. the camera does look like it has an analog signal wire, you could possibly replace it with one of the high end fpv cameras. like a runcam phoenix or caddx ratel 2. other than that looking at the board there's not much else you could do. that's not saying much, you could just as easily solder or desolder the motors and cam. I was more talking about swappable esc or being able to run inav on it https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav Not worth it, those cheap drones get too easily carried by wind, some esp32 cam cameras also work with those boards, but hard to know which works which, since everything is generic and has variations. (There is videos about it, but those are hard to find)"
yea. waait a 30A esc is toomuch for a 1000kv motor?,which protocol does  simonk 30a esc support Pwm. It’s going to be a awful time for a drone
"3.1v ig?. or wait hmm. its for a 5""",No it damn well ain’t. 1000kv is too low. And 3.1v won’t even get props to spin up on those motors Dude you need at least 41 volts (8s) Because for a 5” on 6s you want 1700kv. 1000kv is like 8s territory
"ic. 1400kv?. what if not a 5"" a 10""?",For a 10” you want larger motors and a kv around 950 [this is a 10” motor](<https://shop.iflight.com/XING2-3314-Cinelifter-Motor-Pro2034>) ic. i quit building my first drone
[And this is a 5” freestyle motor](<https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/23xx-brushless-motors/products/iflight-xing2-2306-1755kv-motor>). Arnt you the guy who’s been told repeatedly to just wait until you’re back in the states?,So then just wait till you get back to the states. Grab a radio now if you can and start flying in a sim
And just hand tight right?,"So tighten every 3-4 flights, thanks ♡ Its not that deep. Just check the nuts and look at it using your eyes to see how tight they are Youll definitely be able to tell a loose prop trust me. mhm. You would want them pretty tight. Rule of thumb is you want them tight to a level that getting them back off might take a few seconds of struggle.. Often forgotten fact: Your ""struggle"" might be a different one that mine depending on how long your wrench is.. That would be called leverage"
Fix it or buy new?. Fixed it :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:,"yeah, I dont mean making the connection between the drone and the monitor. I mean grabbing the screen from the skyzone, which can already talk to the drone and then putting it onto another device. Maybe thats impossible though, thanks for the help"
How often should you connect your drone to pc to update / check etc?,I’ve not done it in years. Normally I update whenever some people start raving about the newest whatever
which software would probably be the best for a custom vehicle type?,I haven't plugged mine in in a year. We on BF 4.0
"Guys i have 2 presets saved in separate files and Id like to set them as profile 1 and 2 in pids so i can swap it while on location. But if i swap the preset from file it all gets wiped, do i have to manualy input it?",the presets your applying should have an option for which profile to put them on. use the dropdown Cant seem to find the dropdown Im using this to load preset and it nukes the profiles in PID tuning tab. Just took a screen shot and set it up again oh well
"whats the best site to find stats for motors? I want my drone to go even faster so I was thinking about just popping some new motors in and see what happens, found https://brushlessmotorsparade.com/ but it doesnt show my current ones :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:","https://www.aos-rc.com/aos-labs for more insight its worth paying chris patreon to get access to the PDF's and so on I should I guess, however I don't know a whole lot i'm kinda just assuming how this will work, I got a bnf nazgul a while ago I wonder if it will just fly better if i just shove on some better motors lol"
nazgul is usually fine. what are u missing that lets u think about changing motors?. props make a lot of difference,"it is fine and flys wonderful, I just want it to be faster lol. and im just genuinely curious too try other props. they are cheap. see if that helps. u might also want to change camera angle so u can fly faster"
"I have tried some other props. I kind of like the angle I fly at also, I dont know if I want to change it, but I know what you mean, do you think it would be silly to change xing2 2207 into the aos supernova 1980kv it looks a good bit better , tbh the main reason I want to do it is just because im bored and want to see if I can make it faster / better even? idk. seems like theres alot of tiny things u can do that cost a pretty penny in this hobby whether its worth that or not is debatable but ill try it for the fun of it I guess lol","if you have the spare money for 4 motors, sure go ahead."
how do i charge my batteries with the VIFLY toothstor(550mah 2s gnb)?,"but usually 5"" drones like the nazgul  isnt meant for speed like in a race. they are meant for freestyle"
"true but these motors are meant for either aren't they?, rn i'm trying to figure out if 55a is even enough, and it says 61a beside max current(5s) so I assumings 55a isnt enough, not sure why it says 5s though, trying to find a guide but nothing helped me understand it yet. https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/#Charging-Speed-How-Fast-Should-You-Charge, read this if its your first time, if not well I don't have that charger but im assuming its like every other one make sure the settings are correct then charge :face_with_tongue:","that was first. then yall were slow. then  i asked in gen cause thats where all the chill people are :face_with_raised_eyebrow: if u need 55A so often, u have the wrong drone. or more u use it wrong as in trying to race with a freestyle drone"
Pwm recivers can be binded thru wifi? (er6 to be specific it has wifi but i am not sure if i can bind it like that or i need external something to bind). ?,im not trying to race lol
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) able to help maybe if you have time? :3,ELRS pwm receivers with ESP's in them (which I think all of them) can do everything a normal receiver can
So I can bind with wifi. ?,yes. or just... flash it with a bindphrase Oh that is nice. I dont know neither of em how to do.... Need to find a tutorial for that but we've done that once before already
I mean ye but where shoud i connect it. Doesnt have usb c. Or shoud i do it thru wifi. You mean?,through wifi. most likely well it seems like u want to because u say 55A might not be enough
Oh okey shoudnt be too hard then ig. One more thing what if i use bad 18650 batteries what it can cause?,"not much. very low battery life Oh then good i have some chinese idc if they live long if you push them too hard. like, go over their limit. fires and such could happen"
"There is a very simple mod for generic e58e/e88 drones to improve wifi range and reduce camera delay where they take the wifi antenna and glue it outside the plastic case, and there  is also one where they change it for a stronger one like the one on this ESP32.   I was wondering if this actually improves something, since the case is made of plastic, there can't much interference right? and maybe there isn't a point on using a stronger antenna if the hardware itself is already bottlenecked.  Also worried on stability when using an bigger antenna, since this would definitely make it more unstable. any thoughts on this?","Mobula 6 2024 won't stay in the air on a fresh battery. Betafpv lava 1s, it just falls out of the air after 2-3 seconds.. Looks like someone else has the exact same issue as me lol everyone has been having issues with the thing"
Is my isp mad at me?  Or is the pirate bay down?,"STOP USING PIRATEBAY. it's full of viruses and has been for a loong time. and since you're getting the cloudflare message, pirate bay is the one that is down"
That's a private tracker right?,"Back in like 2006ish I got in.. Extremely private. It's like a job interview to get in.. Then the mods shut down invites. I've only been into RED and the other one to get some music I couldn't find anywhere If you weren't at at least 1:1 you were kicked.. That red thing looks rather interesting. They're quite awful honestly. First time around I got denied for having the ""what to know"" page open while in IRC with them"
Why though. I have seen goof review about it?,"no. if there is darwinfpv in the name then it's bad Tpb sucks. There are some better public options well with darwin there is a little perk, they let you learn to repair drones the instant you take the product out of the box It's okay when it works. But it's very easy to have it stop working but the product in itself is some cheap inreliable crap built by the expert hands of chinese kids with 0 qc that will break after 30min"
When using gyroflow to stabilise my footage should I turn off my O3s Rocksteady?,My mobula 6 hd won’t go into bind mode (frsky) can i ask non drone related but motor related questions here
Idk. Does your vtx support smart audio/irc tramp. And did you set up the vtx table?,i dont think so. nope
can you send me video or smth like that?,Look up the vtx table online and load it in betaflight. Maybe. Lemme see if i can find one Not really a good one. But. Basically. What vtx do you have. If you are sure it doesn’t support smart audio then you need to look up the specific model and vtx table for it. Idk why i said the model part. But the vtx table is different for every vtx
i have this. https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2021/07/27/happymodel-ovx300-ovx303-5-8g-40ch-300mw-vtx-openvtx/. ovx303. and fc is CrazybeeF411 ELRS. should i use tramp?,i will try. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Your fc problably supports both
okay. so which is better?,But smartaudio is more known I don’t know. But i’d go with smartaudio So.

Oh. Try pasting it into cli eh. when i click save
Wtf. Ok that is weird. But is the vtx table configured now?. Or still not,But in the tab does it say a bunch of number at the bottom. Oh wait. That is the tab. Huh
could there be a problem here?,"Maybe. What uart did you hook up the smart audio/irc tramp to. Like physically. On the fc here's the problem, it's a crux35 on a different frame it's a bnf Oh. Uhm. Try putting uart1 on smartaudio on the right in the ports. Otherwise try uart2 Yes. And if it doesn’t do anything try uart 2. And whatever you do DON’T disable usb vcp k c. i clicked save and it removed everything. i tried this now and it didnt remove everything after saving. but this. is still not working Why does it say smartport. Uart2 is the one below uart1. Not to the left lol i know. but. when i set it like this, it removes everything after clicking save. (i clicked save and reboot) That’s weird. Im sorry but i think im now equally as confused as you are. So. I don’t know what you could do tbh :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
do you know someone who could know?,"Can anyone recommend me a motor size for a 3.5"" build, I've seen anything from 1504 to 1804 recommended and don't know which one I should opt for. I know it's a terrible site. But, I kinda stopped caring quite awhile ago.  A lot of porn ads though :shaking_face:. I went years with out torrenting .  No usage = accounts closed. I have 1404's. 1504 sounds fun."
yeah I'm definitely going for 1504 or bigger but I'm a bit confused because the recommendations are so for spread out. for example JB recommends 1604 or 1804 motors on his site and chris rosser recommends 1504 motors. also what KV would you recommend for a 1504 6s?,I had t-motor 1504.... 2650kv or so.
would 3100 be too much?,But I gave them away in a contest here last year.. For 6s Probably start frying coils. I can't really say I have any more info about those motors. I've also looked at some 1804 xnova which are recommended on JBs site but I think they're a bit too big
I love 1804's. I got 2450kv 1804's and it's the best. You can't manually set the MSP port. Why are you trying to?,"anywhere from 1604 to 2004 depending on the  weight of the build, if you want to do a ""light"" (like sub250) 4s 3.5"" then a 1604-1605 would be good, 1804 is a good middle ground, and 2004 is good for a heavy 6s 3.5"". I personnally like 1605 for 4s if you can stay around 250g"
"I saw the axisflying 2004 and the test result of aoslabs (https://www.aos-rc.com/aos-labs/3.5in-freestyle-motors) are pretty impressive. Other ones I'm considering are the XNOVA 1804. And I'm going for 4s I think, because 6s isn't that much better in that weightclass (around 300g auw) right?","You're forgetting the voltage sag part. 6s helps tremendously so, the test results of rosser should be taken with a grain of salt sometimes, since in some cases we have diverging opinions. 6s is very good for 3.5"". even outside of voltage sag"
and what's the kv you would go for?,anywhere between 2400kv to 2700kv
If I'm going 6s maybe the 3.6 inch manta frame would be a good alternative to the aos 3.5 v5. which frame would you recommned?,"I don't like either. I prefer the grinderino Sadly it's out of stock in the shops I'm planning to buy from, otherwise I'd have gone for that one aswell I think the Grinderino also can fit a 3.6"" prop well otherwise the vx3.5 is kinda like a grinderino but different. (volador vx3.5)"
why is that frame better than the aos 3.5?,"cause aos has a reputation of screws falling out and crappy durability i don't know, I didn't see a whole lot of people actually use it, so I can't tell you much about it"
"Me neither, but it looks really solid. Is the grinderino squished X aswell?","you don't want squished X. just get trueX. flies better. also, the manta is a single bottom plate instead of a split bottom design, and the head part extends quite far away compared to a vx3.5 so that might be a failure point Ok thanks a lot for your help you're welcome, also, it would seem like the aos one has about the same design has the manta with a long body design and single plate. but with the aos the single plate is handled a bit differently and it makes the camera a bit more exposed than on a vx3.5/manta the Grinderino is just kind of designed to be beaten up. really hard. and be fine the grinderino is (in my opinion) the best 3.5"" frame. The grinderino is basically a scaled down version of the demibot, and the demibot was already meant to survive the apocalypse"
if i have motors like this. to which way props should be?,"They need to be oriented in the same orientation as the motors But also, run the motors in the opposite direction"
When using gyroflow to stabilise my footage should I turn off my O3s Rocksteady?,+ it makes your props last longer. and doesn't make stuff go into your camera So I just finished fixing/configuring my mobula8(i had to get a replacment board because the motherboard fried) and I just did my first test flight(thankfully inside) because right when I armed it shoots into the air. . .. i know its not something wrong with my controller and im kind of clueless whats wrong right now
Motors going in the right direction?,"Well it will send stuff into your stack so I don't really mention having a cleaner camera has an advantage I don't really care about things going into my stack. frankly there is barely any room to get anything in there I mean, sure, but also if you fly in a dry climate it won't matter regardless of prop direction, and if you fly in a more humid/wet climate it will be bad in both cases you're missing the entire picture"
Then what am I missing?,"having props out will have the whole quad bounce off of objects or deflect from them nah i just checked and the front right and left right motors are spinning the wrong way(compared to pictures online) props in will literally just make anything go into the camera. go into esc-configurator and flip them around Well props out will make anything go into the stack no aymeric a giant tree will not go into the stack That's a different issue no, in <https://esc-configurator.com/> A giant tree isn't a debris"
will it work with my mobula8 though? It doesnt have a dedicated esc since its an AIO board,just close betaflight-configurator on your computer. open that site in a browser based on chrome. connect to the quad (with a battery plugged in). then press read settings in the bottom right kk. yeah m1 and m2 are spinnning ccw once you did all that you can just use the drop down and change the motors to reversed or unreversed and stuff. and then press write settings
"gotcha, m2 should be spinning cw right?. ok so i only need to reverse m1. how i do that","""Normal"" and ""Reversed"" just change em and press write settings. also. it might be worth flashing those escs to bluejay 0.19 and 48khz or something. since you're in there now. that'd also mean you can have a fun start-up song. lol"
if I'm not planning on flying on asphalt (only parks most likely) would you still advise a lot against the aos 3.5?,"I don't know much about frames, but I have heard about a few issues the AOS has. mainly with resonance and durability"
but the resonance should be great no?,from what people have said here not so much
"alright lol, is there a big diffrence bwtween bluejay and betaflight?",Bluejay is firmware for the ESC. the current firmware you have on your ESC is blheli_s
"oh gotcha, will I still be able to betaflight for my configuration?",you might be able to squeeze more flight time out of the mobula by flashing Bluejay to it. yup. completely seperate
ahh alright. where do I install bluejay from?. flash*,"bottom right there's a button ""flash all escs"""
"hmm, but the flight videos (unstabilised) that I've seen look very great. Maybe those problems were with the older versions?","why does my charger decrease the amps going into my battery near the end of charging. like from 0.5A to 0.1A So PPM is something you're not using, we use DSHOT on quadcopters and you select which one to use in Betaflight. PPM is an older way to tell the ESC what to do, and with those sliders you set the range for the PPM protocol.. just like the discharge sag you learnt about yesterday, there's also charging sag. so the charger has to slowly ramp down ohhhhh. itll still make it to the designated V right. ope it just awnsered my question. Ty! if it were to stop at 0.5A suddenly it wouldn't be fully charged. even though the voltage says it is at the time can anyone  tell me if this configuration is stable  motors- sunnyskyx2814 900kv frame- ZD850 hexacopter propellers- tri blade 1170 esc- 40A battery- 10000mah 4s 25c/50c burst controller- pixhawk 2.4.8 application- object detection/agriculture drone gotcha. so now my drone is going beserk. whenever i try to arm(i wanted to make sure it actually flew before changing to bluejah)"
I think the resonance was more flight-controller related than footage. but unsure. huh?,"like on the props it says ""2023""/""2023R"". and my front right and front left ones say ""2023R"" and the back left and back right say ""2023"" props have a leading edge in the picture is props out"
yeah?. so that motor would spin counterclockwise?,you also want to make sure the text on all your props is facing upwards yeah its facing upwards I wouldent put the props upside down :skull: lol. I would. also make sure that on the motor tab in Betaflight you selected the reversed slider of course so Betaflight knows you got props out configured .... also i just checked and m1 and m2's props need to be the other way. just tried arming and now it just spins like 360 degrees or smth then disarms :loudly_crying_face:. https://tenor.com/view/whyyy-why-crying-cry-sad-gif-27338768
this station still useable or trash? found it in my basement - used it for RC cars years ago,yeahhhhhh I would not trust that
When using gyroflow to stabilise my footage should I turn off my O3s Rocksteady?,you shouldn't be stabilizing already stabilized footage is this motor compatible with this frame frame- ZD850 motor- Sunnysky x2814 900KV

"hi, I've always wanted to get into drone stuff but just never really got around to it. I have some free time now so I thought I would start now. I wanna fly fpv drones but I'm super new and don't really know the steps in order to start flying and what license (s) I need, could somebody help me out with this? thanks (not really a quick question but I didn't know where to ask and this channel seemed most appropriate)","I'm not really sure. I've seen some motors from the 3000-4000 size range used on it but it's not a super popular build type in the first place so I'd be guessing The steps depend entirely on your budget in terms of gear. Licenses typically can be disregarded for a hobbyist unless you're required to follow the law precisely welcome in :waving_hand:   usually the very first thing you start with is figuring out what kind of flying you want to do. Recording video, racing, freestyling (flips/tricks), long range, flying indoors, or just flying around and exploring etc. There's plenty of overlap between many of these (though speed, price, and flight time are all kinda in a tugowar with each other). There's also fixed wing stuff if you're into that, especially autonomy and *super* long range stuff (compared to multirotors). Or if you really wanna be weird, there's tricopters :KEKw:. in the mean time also figure out your budget as emilia said, and grab a transmitter (the remote control) in order to connect it to your PC and get on a simulator to practice I like freestyling stuff (while doing video from time to time), purely for recreational use :folded_hands_light_skin_tone:and I plan on saving for the dji fpv drone. I'm a photographer and usually for photography you get everything second hand, not sure if that would cross over into this hobby though haha. again, I'm super new and have no experience so any advice is greatly appreciated :folded_hands_light_skin_tone:"
Didn't mark rober make a 2 motor quad for an iphone?. He made it look kinda easier than it would really be.,"The DJI FPV drone is a mistake for most people. You're going to crash, especially since it doesn't fly very well"
what would you suggest?,"and when it does you'll have to pay tons of money and send it back instead of it surviving/you repairing it in an hour or two my budget is around 600-1.2k Maybe make it look more like a potato I'd suggest you try and get a DIY setup going at that budget. doesn't even have to be ""diy"". For that budget it can be as simple as buying 4-5 things and being set for way longer RadioMaster Boxer (controller) 120~ USD, DJI or Walksnail goggles 300-450 usd, Bind-and-fly drone 300-500 usd, charger 100~ usd and then you're pretty much there"
"I'll check it out, tysm, what about the simulator I was told about? do I need a high end rig pc for it or will it run decent on a medium level laptop?. meant to reply to the other message mb","it should work perfectly on even a potato. velocidrone definitely does okay thank you, if I have any further questions I'll definitely ask in here. you guys have been a very big help, thank you :thumbs_up: One thing to add if you go searching to buy:. buying from FPV stores in the US is far cheaper than Amazon or anything will be avoid amazon like the plague for fpv stuff. and in general its a good idea too A small list of stores is Pyrodrone (California), RaceDayQuads (Florida), Wrekd (Ohio), DefianceRC (No clue) and GetFPV (Florida)"
"I usually buy gear second hand, is that a good idea in this genre or no?","If you can find the things you actually need then yes I was thinking about buying a dji mini just to understand how drone flying works again because i havent flown since i was about 9 :face_with_tears_of_joy:, saw it on mpb for 200 in excellent condition A camera drone is very different from an FPV one A camera drone basically flies itself, it also has sensors so you don't crash and such. an FPV drone is full manual control ah okay. thank you again"
does the fact that i have a radio with elrs 3.0 and my drone has elrs 2.0 will make any problem with binding?,the receiver and tx needs to be on the same major release I'm guessing it's a tinywhoop with an SPI receiver. type `diff all` in CLI and save to file before you update Betaflight
It's correct. I can't show you the wiring because its already unsoldered. Could it be because i hook up a slightly   damaged antenna?,no. you probably had one of the power wires that broke off I get to test each end of the wire and they were fine
were all the wires still soldered on the receiver and on the fc ?. and did you test the 5v output of the fc ?,"Yeah. Every 5v pads are all fine, the 5v indicator is still on"
"did you try to send power to the receiver with a psu ? (like I know the hota d6 pro can serve has a psu with variable voltage, so you hook it up to one and select 5v)",Oh that way I don't have a PSU
"Nope. Also, what's the safe temperature for soldering battery pads?","like 350. c. it's the same temperature for everything I tried 440 because 400 just eont melt them 440 will fry the board. higher temperature isn't the answer when stuff doesn't melt has fast has you want. the issue is usually that there isn't enough watts being pumped into the iron, not that the temperature is too low"
Does doing this for 3 minutes long damage my esc?,"well unfortunately I left my crystal ball at home so I can't inspect your esc at distance. also, if you are certain the 5v is correct and working, you should just resolder the receiver on, see if you can reflash it in elrs configurator, and if neither works, personnally I would assume it's dead"
anyone have knowledge of frsky? i am having trouble binding a new drone,"If you just bought FrSky, returning it is usually the correct answer. but if you can't, then tell us the receiver and transmitter"
"verb or noun?. the gyro is only there to give you angular velocity. The accelerometer provides angle information, but it's all relative. A magnetometer (compass) gives you the actual direction compared to earth's magnetic field","in both ways. most of the time I think they say in the website how to flash your drone or how to flash your firmware.  I couldn't any other right example in the dictionary.. *find as a verb it just means to ""upload"" new firmware to the chip"
"@Vitroid how to 'upload' your drone? , how to 'upload' your firmware?","that depends on what you actually want to flash, there are different tools for your flight controller, ESC, radio hardware, etc..."
so horizon mode rely on compass ?,"Horizon/Angle modes only need a calibrated accelerometer to tell the relative angle of the FC. but if you need heading info (for self navigation for example), you need a proper heading source"
"if i enable the horizon mode while drone up side down, it will be upside down horizon?","it may attempt to level itself off again, but it would be quite jarring. I'd stick to Angle or Acro haha, gonna try that. thanks for your answer!"
Should I do filter tuning prior to PID tuning?,"My 5"" uses a mix of m3 and m2. The majority being m3 damn, i already purchased m2.5 Normally the screws are supplied with the frame the screws are prone to stripping Less torque or a better hex driver why do they made them hex socket. really hate the design choice Their cheap. Replace them if you want. But id rather just buy a £6 bag of all my screws needed every now and then. Or just get a stronger material"
@Vitroid  sorry for the ping. I used your diff file for the mob6 2024 (https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/546421137077305398/1241829322692493423) as i was not getting OSD on my HDzero googles with TBS Fusion module. but even after using it i still only get video instead of video+OSD.  any advise?. Mob is on BF 4.5,"hey which is the best software to design a model for laser cutting I like fusion, but you can also use solid works or onshape, but all should work so long has you select the right file format Any CAD program you can get access to will work fine. In the end, they’ll all be able to produce identical models Go to the CLI tab and click `Submit Support Data`, then send the resulting ID here 18ece668-564b-4485-898c-070640c659d8 flash again with OSD(HD) removed from the options list"
done. apply your diff again?,i have no idea how to design these can anyone help. inkscape*
ok shall use it. is it easy tho?,I would say the 3 are equivalent
can these be ignored?,"idk if that would work, parts are traditionally designed in a CAD program I find fusion to be a lot more intuitive to me I’m not saying it wouldn’t work, but I personally have no experience using programs like that"
so on shape would work?,"we have video+OSD :PepeHappy:. awesome, appreciated most mainstream CAD programs have tons of tutorials, both official and on youtube can anyone teach me how to use it or there r good toturals on youtube. ic yeah, I have used onshape for several years, its pretty good also, from what I see inkscape looks like a drawing platform, so it most likely won't support the file format. and I also doubt it will have the features of a cad software. also, fusion and onshape have free versions, tho iirc solidworks doesn't SPI mode isnt right, isnt it. pretty sure it was UART then set it back to UART yeah, i don’t think sw does :( ill send what i have designed in a few mins can anyone tell if it will work and iirc, (it's been a while since I used onshape) onshape is supposed to be a more streamlined/simplified version on a cad software compared to like fusion, *but I can be wrong, it's been a while since I used onshape* its pretty similar to other cad programs (especially solidworks), but it had a simplified workflow and is a bit easier to learn imo. it also has a really comprehensive learning resource library there is this platform called tinker cad will it work. it looks super easy as well ok, personnally I learned in school with solidworks (tho we learnt like how to rotate cubes, so I basically didn't learn a thing), and fusion was very natural ehh, i don’t think so. maybe for something *super* basic, but you really won’t get the accuracy you’d want so, tinkercad is a simplified version of a cad software, you should really go with fusion or onshape so you have a good base if you want to do half complex shapes also, I doubt you’d be able to export parts in the correct format for laser cutting nah its just a plane sheet of metal with a design tinkercad is basically dragging cubes and circles and that's about all it can do not complex at all just a few holes I know, but laser cutters usually use DXF file formats, and I don’t think tinkercad supports that you should still go with fusion or onshape yea it only has stl or other stuff. ok I would recommend looking into onshape or fusion, it’ll probably only take you a few hours to learn how to make what you want to make You should modify the dump in the #announcements thread to include ```feature -RX_SPI feature RX_SERIAL``` and remove the ExpressLRS config lines (especially the UID): ```set expresslrs_uid = 84,217,131,200,122,235 set expresslrs_domain = ISM2400 set expresslrs_rate_index = 1 set expresslrs_switch_mode = HYBRID```"
can .svg be converted to dxf?,i had to ping the other guys sry man
yeah but what's the question ?,"no idea, but I'm not sure why you'd do that instead of just exporting as a dxf i kinda used tcad befor so yea just use dxf, it's supported I would still just recommend using a real CAD program also, if you go with fusion (which you should) never ever update, all they do is remove features from the free version"
"btw, what exactly are you trying to design?",a frame for and rc. like drone parts r not tht good in india for planning to do smth in the mean time. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) WHAT TO DO this is just a preference thing DOWLOAD FUSION AND LEARN TO WORK WITH THAT
yea what setting?. well u told onshape. bbruh,onshape is fine too. (its what i would recommend)
so what settings should i put?,"cm or mm for distance probably also, I don't know how to use onshape or a laser cutter, I never had to use a laser cutter until now, and I don't like onshape either, so ping choco instead deg and deg/sec for angle idk which other options there are to change. but that's probably all you need to change now im getting runaway while trying to take off:confused_dog:   confirmed motor order and direction.  props are correct because i have flew already without OSD oh FC orientation is wrong. first gyro was CW 90 but should have been CW 0°"
"Could someone please advise me on the appropriate charging voltage for Li-ion battery packs? My charger suggests 4.1 volts per cell, but I am more familiar with LiPo batteries. Additionally, I would like to know the safe discharge limit for these batteries when used in flight.

Thanks
i just bought the dji avata 2 but i cant use the easy acro funktion it dont shows up what should i do is it because of the beginner mode?,"4.1 is correct, 3v is basically empty but you can run them down to 2.5v. most importantly you can't charge them at 1c The FlyFish ones look great. everything also does. But FYI Tracer and other things are an utter waste of money nowadays, it's expensive and worse than ExpressLRS"
"Excuse me, could you please explain why you are unable to charge them at 1C?. Do i go by the mah?","Most li-ion cells can't charge that fast, you'd have to go off of their specs to see what is save. I'd start at 0.5C Would have also preferred expressLRS but I was able to find a cheap TBS Mambo used. thanks even then it's worth getting ExpressLRS. tracer is *really* not worth getting into. you can get an ELRS receiver for 13 bucks"
you can get elrs modules for dirt cheap too. How much did you pay for the mambo?,"I could sell it for about the same With the Mambo you're always stuck with the weird OpenTX fork, and Tracer is just a struggle"
would you recommend selling the mambo and buying a radiomaster boxer? I could probably get elrs that way for about a 20 euros more,"It'd be loaaads cheaper. and way more future proof. and it'll also come on all the BNF quads and tinywhoops the thing is I'm not planning on owning a bunch of quads so I don't know if it's worth making the switch... It is. because even at two receivers you could be getting 4 or 5 elrs receivers. plus ELRS is just genuinely better and always improving on existing hardware i would have to try that haha - yeah 500euro You'd be spending 60-70 euros on soldering gear, Pinecil, 63/37 leaded solder from a name brand and some brass wire at the minimum"
"Do you already have DJI goggles?. The pavo 20 is okay, it just won't handle being outside that well",Glad i didnt burn the house at 2.5

are 650mah 6s batteries enough?,That's what I'd use on a similar setup. You might prefer heavier though
do you think 4 batteries are enough?,"and you shoud create a Tip jar or seomthing for all the help you give haah I'd ask about when that ISDT charger was bought, they've been having QC issues for over a year now. also, don't factor in batteries into the price i know its not been used and in new pakage You don't know where they've been and they might as well be dead"
which loading station would you suggest?,Hota for AC-integrated ones. ToolkitRC can be cheaper if you can find a cheap power supply

that?. and just screw the antenna on the it then?,"remove the little rings too I think ok. what are those for anyways depending on if your mount has a slot for it why r they there. oh ok the first one is just a washer I think, the one that is like not connected is a piece that keeps it from coming loose from vibrations and stuff this is as far as it will screw on. is that ok k and now to put the connector on the vtx split lock washer is the thing. well no, you put the pigtail through the 3d print first yeah. so how am i gonna fit this whole thing thru there remove the antenna -> push the pigtail through the print -> put all the washers and nuts on it to hold it in place -> screw the antenna on It should not be necessary to remove a motor just to put the prop on. Make sure you haven't accidentally cross-threaded the nut oh yes i will do this first. What i meant tho is that the connector is kinda long and there isn’t much space between the mount and the vtx cable bends. you basically just have to buy a shorter one or suffer"
"ok :(. well i’ll try this for now, when i was buying i didn’t see a shorter option. should i put all 3 rings back on? because if i do there isn’t a ton of space left for the antenna to screw on. There is enough space but it’s not as deep","you can do only the ""nut"" the lock washer would be nice of course, as it keeps stuff in place"
Is there a way to quickly switch like profiles i mean from my RC car running pwm radiomaster reciver to my drone running elrs?. I dont wanna each time bind em,i don’t see how this can even fit. The black part of the sma connector is not flexible and it seems too long to let the mount fit back in :slightly_frowning_face:
Isnt it like you push those pins into those 2 holes sma connector pointing back of a plane?,that's called a model doge
I can switch it on my radio?,"ok i will try. how much can i bend the sma connector the black part isn't really meant to be bent. but you can't do much about it so... yeah but with the pinkish part, can it be at a high angle. let me get a pic. this is with the mount not even pushed all the way in"
You dont own a printer right?,"i know a guy that has one. he got me this part well that looks fine. but. putting the receiver where you did is kind of a really bad spot for it anyways. like the last thing you want is to have two RF things next to each other i didn’t put it there, this is a pre built It seems pretty loose i would remodel it and reprint"
You will be putting on it the top?. Carbon fiber?,yeah there is a carbon fiber top if that’s what ur asking
here it states that I can simly put the empty file with the firmware on the sd card ?,that will hold it all in place
It means you cannot put it on because its too high?,i know manuals says that but something different is on the website ;s
Or the top doesnt effect it?,"My guess is that the ""video board"" is something else entirely. but you should ask in the Walksnail Discord. or the wiki Discord no, in the pic i didn’t push it all the way in because the sma connector is kinda in the way, but i will push it in all the way and put on the top plate after if fix this antenna issue."
You mean the cable right?,"yes i indeed did need to hold it with all my might but it finally went in and that's why I use T-Mount, I ain't strong enough for that yeah the pink cable is the sma connector https://discord.gg/hXNawdJ8 couldnt find a 14xx motor with 12x12 mounts in stock I am not expert but i would say its pretty bendable the cable and the part (Black one shoud be bendable little bit also. Its only hear shrink Take it out and try to move it carefully if you can bend it a little bit. :D i mean it looks like the part under the black part of the sma cable is metal because it doesn’t want to bend. i could bend it but idk if that would break it if it is indeed metal i bent part of it a little and i think that made it fit better I think all cables can be bend a little i think it should work now let me draw something on the photo I mean put it on and when you will be screwing the top it shoud gently press it. :D"
"i think the part in between green is bendable cable, but i think the part i between red is nonbendable metal. but yeah i think this should fit now. ok so i think this works, and now i just need to get the sma to plug into the thingy on the vtx. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) does this look correct?",yeah. I'd flip the vtx around lol
"is it a 5"". did you set it to 2A mode?","its a 5 ich and. and set what to a 2a the battary i have no idea. how do i check which one do you have. oh rip. does it trigger when the esc starts turning on. or making beeps yeah it makes beeps the stops right before you hear the turn on beep. then that means the motors are drawing too much power. if there's visually nothing wrong, then it's probably all good we usually recommend smoke stoppers like the vifly one. because you can change the limit to a higher one. meaning it won't trip from the motors"
"Which props are better, folding or non folding?",@emilia do i just plug it in without the smoke stopper. what does it mean when i saw sparks at the esc and fc. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) at the compaster connecter so should i just plug in the battary without the smoke stopper it didnt turn one of the motor wires poped off and. heard it for like a sec and thats it
Does my vtx rx go to my fc tx?,yup. transmit <-> receive
Quick question about my moonlight. Does this need to be connceted or only while updating?,I assume only when updating
Is 8mph too much wind for the mobula8?. 13 mph gusts,find out. if it starts floating away just disarm
ok so I today was my first flight on my 5 inch. I got too hyped and didnt notice voltage. it hit a lowest of 10v and rigth after unplugging it hit 13 while still hot. so how fked am I?,I hope you charged it asap
how long ago was it?. because if it's still hot after hours that might just be a bomb,I few like 4 mins ago. its cooling down keep a close eye on the IR and voltage also it feels very very slightly puffy and if it's getting warm and such. and if it smells sweet
Which 6/10 channel receiver?,"not any. the pocket doesn't come in a 4-in-1 version oh the cc2500 pocket can probably control that. nope, only cc2500 Just get a elrs PWM rx"
not the elrs version?,"however, you can get an even better reciever with elrs. it's 1-in-1 my plan is that i'll use pocket master elrs for my fpv and  a normal 10ch receiver for my rc planes. if this isnt possible that i cant take the pocket The get a elrs pwm rx for your planes. Best of all worlds"
what do you need 10 channels for?,"sorry, was looking at https://betafpv.com/products/superp-14ch-diversity-receiver the radiomaster ER8 is probably more than enough for you normally i need 4 channels but i also want to install flaps https://www.racedayquads.com/products/radiomaster-er6-2-4ghz-elrs-pwm-receiver"
can i bind this with the pocket?,"smaller, lighter. the elrs pocket, yes"
also im flying in 32c weather and I can touch the motors for 1-2 seconds before its too hot so is that fine?,its like 40 degrees here
u from india or bangladesh?,"Sorry brain functiont. Motor size Yeah sounds about right for them to get toasty. On the smaller side for 5”. Especially on 4s oh wtf I thought 2306 was the standard size for 5ich. like 2207 or 2306 Hey, I got a SMA FOXEER Pagoda PRO 150mm and planning to use it on my TBS SOURCE ONE V5 5"" body, can't really think of a way that it would be good. also got a 3d printer Cheers mate ill do that!. Ye that's the only thing. Otherwise the o3 perfect and motors spin by hand nicely."
You have the 4200mAh molicells right?,"Ye I ca t complain tbh. Only had a total of 6 flight, but can't really complain alright, I'll order them then I also have p42a for my 4s long range.. The amount of flight time is bonkers. 26 minutes. I'm planning on a 4s2p pack for my glider wing. and then a 5s pack for my SO's bicycle and my bicycle I only brought them cuase the oascar liang page and other youtubers said they were the best. I'm a nerd and looked at all the sheets That's a great price per cell. <https://liionwholesale.com/>. It's from a US wholesale site, it's awesome. it sucks that the 4500mAh ones are double the price lol I paid alot more per cell.. Oh my bad I use 4500 hah you're really good at leaking your info you need to be more careful, people have clients that keep deleted images up. and it also stays in the cache and Discord's CDN for a long time I'm currently on a night shift at work. It's been a rough one so tired as fuck I'm excited for them. I think I already have 4 of them in my goggle pack, but unsure I haven't had a flight yet where I've gone below 3v. I know I can and my warning is set to 2.7v. But it just kept going and going. I don't think I have ever charged my goggle pack. so that checks out"
Lol mental. How long u been running them?,"Probably a month now, and they're probably on about 20 minutes a day. I have to charge them soon though. they're very low 20 min flight time a day. You lucky person hah. I wish I had more packs"
BTW could it get potential moisture between the esc/fc cable that was causing that issue?,definitely could've been. I have never seen that before though. pretty weird It is if you're not running a higher power setup...  which you're not.. idk what cats is on about
well then if I can grip my motor for 1-2 seconds is that too hot?. its at 32c weather btw,Ye fair enough well I'll check the cable and I've stuck it on top of my PC which is on (exhausting 60c hest) to help dry it out. I'll check blheli as well.
well how do I fix it?. it was also similar to this on stock beta flight tune,"If the motor is too hot to hold, it's too hot.. With the KV that you're running it's most likely a noise issue gotta figure out the source of the issue. Make sure there's nothing loose in the drone, the props are clean, etc"
when i first flew it on new props and motors. it was like I could grip it for 1-2 seconds before it got too hot for me to touch. is that still too hot?,I have no idea how heat tolerant you are.  The general rule of thumb is a general rule of thumb.. The motors should only be considerably hot after flying hard. I would say maybe 38 40 idk
"Hello, Is  the FrSky Taranis xd9+ still a good radio transmitter? I am asking because I already have it and would like to get back into fpv drones after a few years break.","It's not an amazing radio by modern standards, but it can work with the newer systems... with some hardware mods Just seen what other people are selling it for on ebay or fb Thanks but i need to know how much ill get from the drone after 2-3 years. But thanks that helps me Depends on how many successive models are released, but generally around half its value after 3 years"
whats a propeller shaft?,it’s the small cylindrical part of a motor that the propeller sits on
Do they require the dual-band antennas?,"Yes there are four antennas, same as the goggles 2. The mods to replace them seem relatively simple, but do require some disassembly but is is weird that within 30 meters and one house betweeen the drone and i i lose signal with the goggles idk about dji but on like 300mW analog i think that seems pretty normal"
so if I have 3 blade props I use 3?,Not sure where you made that connection
So I crashed into a tree and the balance lead has broken.  I noticed some sparking when two of the wires touch … what do I do? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Do I put electric tape over it or something?,"Yes, look up his series on analyzing blackbox logs. Replace the balance lead and don't let those pins short against each other unless you want to make your battery catch on fire"
"I know I need to replace it, but in the mean time, tape them all?",if ita just that one wire thats lose and can spark then ye. make sure its wrapped good wrap them up individually
Break off the white bit entirely?,"if they're in there solid and no way they touch, you can keep them in"
How much volts? You use. 12 volts?,It's USB PD so it's 20V
Hmm on 12 volts it woudnt work Best ye?,I'm sure it'd be okay Depends on what you're doing. 12V may not be enough to maintain the tip temperature for a large joint. I have 3 options 1)buy another power bank 2)use current i have its 12 volts 3)buy long usb c cable that goes directly to outlet
what's your budget doge and where do you live?,Depends on price i mean not sure and Slovakia
"<https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802580965278.html> you could get something like this?. or a smaller phone charger, anything that's at least 65W","Link aint working for me I linked to a ugreen 100W brick, from their official store"
Wait wait @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) you mean brick as mobile phone charger those?,yup. any phone charger 65W and above (with USB-PD) will work fine I use that for charging 1s batteries for drone :D that'd work perfectly fine for powering the pinecil. as long as you use a usb-c to usb-c cable
Yep i have that for charging 1s batteries it came with that. Okey so only thing is getting longer cable for it. Because the cable what came with it its short. Do you think its better getting from original Site pinecil v2 or slovak site the difference is like 10 euro its about the warranty and if it arrives broken etc what you think?,I'd pay 10 bucks just for the faster shipping Nwm its 20 bucks now :skull:. 35 bucks USA and 57 or around that Slovakia. What you think
usa?.... I think you should just order from pine64,Oh that is good. Thanks for help :D How tf does Gyro Flow work you open it. then you put in the files. then you set your settings. and then you render
What amperage should this battery be charged at https://a.co/d/8riBHr6. https://www.getfpv.com/flywoo-explorer-750mah-hv-2s1p-80c-lipo-battery-2pcs-xt30.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DM+-+NB+-+PMax+-+Shop+-+SM+-+ALL+%7C+Full+Funnel&utm_content=pmax_x&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=&campaign_id=17881616054&network=x&device=m&gc_id=17881616054&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjLGyBhCYARIsAPqTz1_mpHQ4G2Lj0_jibAIJ5hCAc07jjXhtxUoj_hwgFAZoiYVv0-VpLrQaAjGHEALw_wcB. Same with this,Like 1.5A max. 0.75/0.8A
can someone take a look at this and tell me what you think. I heard WS had worse penetration than DJI but this chart makes it look like the difference isnt as high as everyone is making it out to be. if anything ws penetration is ranked higher?,"Walksnail penetration is fine. the reason people say it's worse is because Walksnail has a mix receiver, not diversity. which means you either have a patch or an omni, having both is useless"
you mentioned a new vrx that has a diversity support later this year right?,they're planning on doing that yeah
does that mean new goggles or just a new vrx you can replace the old one with?,new vrx you can replace the old one with at the very least
i think ive asked this before but does ws have transmission versions? I dont exactly understand how this works but what im getting at is does WS have something equivalent to DJI's occusync stuff ie new version has better range/penetration than the latter but is also incompatible with older goggles/vtx due to incapable hardware. I understand all of this is due to the transmission power but i think DJI has different multi pathing methods every iteration.,"so far Walksnail has stayed compatible with everything and has stayed basically the same i got confused since they have so many versions. There is the single antenna and dual version buts also things like v1 and v2 with the avatars and then there is the moonlight and the lite versions. everyone gets confused, it's weird too my understand they all have the same performance except the 1s and 1s lite due to smaller power output. so at this point excluding the moonlight what is their best product to date. is it the avatar v2 dual antenna dual or single doesn't matter too much but It's probably the Avatar V2 **Pro**. dual will have slightly better signal in very specific situations not worth it or just go with it as standard not worth it for something like a freestyle quad and whats the difference between the pro and the v2 aah right. and finally between these if im whooping whichever the lightest one is. which is probably the *race* one. but you can ask Ian for tips on that. I think the race one is just the 1s kit with no heatsink which is the race one im assuming the 1s is just the nano without the heatsink"
"Hello, how low of a voltage should I let my 4s battery get on my 5in freestyle before I change it out for a full one?","https://walksnail.wiki/en/hardware Change your OSD to have only average cell voltage. you land when you're *hovering* at 3.5v, anything below that will damage it"
honestly from vids its prolly gonna peak at 18 so should I go for 35 or 20?. coz like isnt 35 overkill,"overkill is better than having an ESC go up in smoke. you always want to have some headroom, if the motor was tested to pull 2A over the ESC rating, that's not gonna go well"
doesnt most esc have some headroom like a 40a esc for eg can do 45a for 10 second bursts?,"you want the escs to be a lot higher than what the motors will pull at full throttle. cause if you crash you can have a huge amp draw that will last maybe .5s, but if your motors pull 55A on full throttle and you have a 55A esc with a 60A burst but the motors pull 65A for .5s, the esc is not going to like that. that's why on most 5"" we use some motors that would pull like 35A at max throttle, but we use some 55A+ escs. and it won't stress the escs has much if you overspec them, so they will last significantly longer. so get the 35A, even if the motors only draw 18A each at max throttle"
that's a motor size... what mounting size does the stack need to be ? 16x16 / 20x20 / 25x25 / 30x30 ?,"3 inch cinewhoop on the cloud 149. V1 what mounting size I mean OH. 30x30 and 20x20 works why dosent my 1000kv motor power on when i do the right connectons Good question, without some photos and more context it's going to be hard to answer, it could be that you don't power it from an esc, maybe that the esc is broken, maybe the wiring is bad, maybe the motor as a broken windings, we would need some more information if you want a real answer so what info should i give Some pictures, what specific motor it is, what are you using to power it yada yada 1000kv motor. 3s 11v batt"
no. how do i?. when i connect makes beep sounds,"You plug it into a charger. And it will tell you the voltage ok. i have ripoff charger. it has no display. yes it has 11 volt i checked Also, check that the pmw receiver and the radio are binded wit a volto meter. yes they r. it works for servo That's a great way to lose your house Then either the esc or motor is faulty, so if you have a second motor on hand you should swap them and see if the issue persists, same thing with the esc"
did you swap the motor or the esc ?,i swapped both ecs and motor and interchanged
"well you aren't exactly working with reliable hardware here, so it's possible the receiver doesn't work ? I don't know",Wow thanks this is actually really helpful. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) and the esc makes some beep beep noise when i plug it in. to the batt
Does anyone know the name of this tool?. I know Ethix has a similar one but I want that long one,@NightEagle you need to calibrate the ESC throttle first. It will just keep beeping until you do this is the one thing you absolutely don’t want to cut corners on. it’s cheaper to buy a nice charger than recover from a burnt down house
"Getting back into learning my drone, decided to weight it with all the gear. Forgot to bring the props to the store to weight those with it, but counting the drone itself, the battery, and the GoPro 7; it totaled out at around 765 grams. Is this considered really heavy for an FPV?","That's considered perfectly fuckin average for a 5"" build Thanks!. Been trying to see what version of this drone on the steam workshop would be best to use in Liftoff"
Hello! Had my first Little crash today and my 3s battery got a little dented. Is it still safe to send?,"So, I didn't try velocidrone micro, I only used it to try some X class quads, but I did use extensively liftoff micro drones, and if you don't want to train for races, it's pretty good, and relatively accurate in my experience"
Does it smell sweet? Is the IR still the same?,"So I've heard... I really don't care about racing at all, only interested in freestyle. Bit of a hard choice atm, some people are recommending velocidrone and I think it's quite fair, seems like an industry standard, but at the same time I've read that big quad sims have a different physics engine, which don't reflect as well on micro quads, therefor something like liftoff micro drones with dedicated engine for micros might be better ;/ But not sure if it still stands as new updates come out and things tend to change. :face_with_rolling_eyes: micro drones doesn't fly very well at all looks stable, just treat it extra carefully. and try to write down the IR and if certain cells are lower and such So, if you want my advice, just go with one that has a lot of cool maps, because at the end of the day, the physics won't ever be perfect, and also your quad most likely won't be the exact same as in the sim, personally I was lucky since the fractal 75 open prop of liftoff micro drones very closely reassembled my 75mm open prop, but if the specific quad isn't basically based on the same components has yours, it won't fly the same, so might has well just go with the one that has some cool obstacles, you only really need perfect physics when you race, when you do freestyle you aren't trying to repeat exactly the same movements to the tenth of a second like in racing Well, cool map wise probs would pick uncrashed then. But I really don't care for all the as much. Been playing lot's of fps.skydive and the building site and canyon map was plenty for me. For drone variety, done some DRL and it was fun, but now looking for as close to the actual physics as possible. ATM and I think for a while only care to replicate mobula7 and crux3 1s micros to build up the muscle momery and get really good at them. Well, as far as I know liftoff micro doesn't have a crux3 equivalent. But I think velocidrone does. Not sure"
"Hello, what is the current limiting factor ? The motors or the ESC ?  As in if I put the throttle to the max, will the current be capped by the max motor amp draw or by the ESC ?","It will be ""capped"" by neither. The maximum current you can reach is determined by how much current the battery can deliver, and how much current you can pump through either the ESC or the motor without them self-immolating"
"I see. Here's my problem, the motor spreadsheet says that the max current is 5,46A with a 3S. And my ESC is rated for a constant current of 13A. So how do I avoid burning the ESC ? Is there a way to artificially ""reduce"" the max thrust of the drone by moving the max input from the transmitter ?","I don't see the problem. 5.46 < 13 Here's the spreadsheet, and I believe that the values on it are for a single motor Right, and 4-in-1 ESCs are rated *per channel*. So your 4-in-1 or AIO that has a 13A rating can handle up to 13A *per motor*. That's 52A total Oh, thank you very much, I didn't knew it was per channel."
can i just loed my batteries for the radiomaster zorro while they are in the remote via a usb C cable?. load*. or do i need some loading station for that aswell,"It's called charging. and yup, bottom USB-C port most likely english is a hard language hahaha. thx tho :slightly_smiling_face: I very much understand the loading thing in Dutch It's opladen so I'd think it would be loading too. lol yeah i am german. aufladen. hahaha"
lol. how would i realign if that was the case?,"I've had the same symptom before and it was a result of the gears between the motor and prop being loose or misaligned or smth if you were to stop that prop with your finger, it would immediately stop and slowly spool back up to speed oh i see. ill take a look **only do this with a toy grade brushed quad that you know is weak**. (if you do that with a brushed quad of that size, you'd likely end up in the hospital and walk out with 9 fingers :PepeHappygun:) It depends on what the exact cause is, but I remember at least one of my cases being that the gear on the motor was coming loose from its shaft, so I just carefully put some superglue on the very end of the shaft/gear. you have to be careful cause clogging the gear's teeth with glue will likely lead to it not biting right and also don't want to weld the shaft and motor stuck lol. and if you put the glue on the shaft *then* put the gear on, the glue would likely get pushed down to the motor and seize the whole thing as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. sometimes, though, you just need to push one of the gears back into place so that the gears are properly meshed together cool. ill try it and let you know how it goes. tysm"
its a 3s. Is there anything I can do to make it usable?,"yes that's pretty bad. might still be usable though. unless that's a 4s I mean it should be usable. it'll just sag harder. keep an eye on the cell voltages being lower than others Like turbo lag, but the boost never goes positive. Hello, one of the cells on my 4s battery I’m pretty sure is dead. So could I just replace the dead cell with one of the cells from this old 2s battery"
So should I just take out the dead cell?,That's pretty much the only option sadly
"Ok, do u have any recommended guides or tips on how to take it out safely?",what i was told is that doing that kind of work is not worth burning your house down. I'm farrrr from the brightest light here.  But even I have done that.. I followed procedures from a yt channel. It was the soldering part that kinda scared me.
My 450- 2s battery on the Acrobee75 with o3 drops from 4.14v to 3.75 in 14 seconds. Any idea why?,it should hold around 3.8-3.7 for a while. that's kinda normal for heavier micro builds Mmm they didn't stay there tho :grinning_face_with_sweat:
are these batteries new?,Usually I stop flying at 3.65 but they just bleed... I couldn't land in time. Yes. New quad new bats Yeah and the recommended battery was 450 so :person_shrugging:. And I tested it on two batteries
what specific batts are they?,"2S 450mAh 80C GNB LiHV Battery - XT30 By Gaoneng. (I also bought a pack of these just to see, but these aren't used yet (Explorer 750mAh HV 2S 80C Lipo Battery (2pcs) By Flywoo)) hmmm GNB LiPos should be good"
Are you already logged in on your account on velocidrone.com?,"how do i change password on veloci drone help me asap Log out and then go here https://www.velocidrone.com/password/reset ongod thank you so much. i love you Why they don't have an option when you're logged in is baffling to me. Easy tiger, I'm already spoken for"
Is that just a little scuff?,Yea mostly but it's smelly and slowly bubbling out oh. leave it outside far away from anything flammable. and on concrete Yea that's a punctured cell and needs to be neutralized
The little antenna cover at the tip of my O3 antenna fell off... Is my quad still safe to fly?. This part,"That cover protects the antenna from physical damage in a crash. Physical damage to the antenna can diminish or completely ruin its ability to transmit. You *can* fly without it, but GL in a crash Will use this for a few more cinematic flights that I planned. No more freestyle for now. Ordered a new one already Personally I like to heatshrink or wrap those in electrical tape so they don't fall off. Because they do like to fall off IME Ill super glue the next one on there..."
Should I get the original DJI antenna or a different one?. Is there better ones out there?,"there was just a convo on this in #fpv-drones. and read this. https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/ Thanks :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: I heard good things about matchsticks Nice it worked and i learned how to handle lipos thanks :3 so like this with a pigtail, https://pyrodrone.com/products/truerc-matchstick-5-8-sma-long-antenna-lhcp"
Is that EU available?,"I don't know, check the EU stores"
am I right saying the matchsticks are better then the regular O3 antenna?,Not sure but what i see they shoud be. But depends on what purpose you use
"well, I think matchsticks are for VTX antenna no?. do people put them on goggles as well?",I am not Best at this topic i never used dji goggles or any of dji stuff i mean only camera drones.... I use only after market antennas
what antenna are you using now?. I got the cherry rush,"no, not really. the VTX antennas that come with dji and walksnail nowadays are perfectly fine. don't really have to change them. if you want something super durable get the matchstick. personally I just buy a bunch of flyfishrc antennas instead of 1 expensive matchstick"
how can I compare antennas?. is there like specs or is it just by asking people and testing them?,there's specs in the descriptions. but there's also the build quality and correct tuning of every part that's important
If i plug balance plug wrong lets say on battery tester may it damage the battery? Or tester. Or only the main XT60 plug matters?,depends on your tester
"wait, what is a tester?","ehm, nice and small. might cop Idk who idea was to put tons of Black cables on balance plug but i got only confused :dotted_line_face:. Just plug it right as you send me the guide"
Do you think its worth redoldering all 10 batteries with Bt2.0 connectors? From the original ones not sure rn name,soldering batteries seems really dangerous to me Nope those small connector for 1s. Risk ur life for 1 second of flight time :thumbs_up: 6 minutes. Too bad i broke my soldering Iron :smiling_face_with_tear: I left it on for too long. So the tip got Black that doesn't break it if you got the pinecil That is the issue :smiling_face_with_tear: just... tin the tip and then clean it in genuine brass wire I would say i made an bad decidion but ye i didnt know because i didnt know anything about soldering How do you know what your radio erls is like 1.0 2.0 or 3.0 by checking the version. or just... update it to the latest because it should be anyways How do I know what my receiver is because then I only have to do one. Ok it’s v3. I have the radio master zorro I looked everywhere and couldn’t find what it is Just update it to the latest Is  v2.10.0 da new one 2.10 sounds a lot like newest EdgeTX Yea. It’s not giving me the build and flash option
What happens if your radio dies mid flash?,just press flash. they renamed it most likely fine. bootloader generally stays okay My radio has been saying it’s batteries low for 20 minutes I’ve been trying to flash for two hours
Follow the flashing guide. And why are you flashing such an old version? Flash 3.4.1,well i think i have to do a old one first or sum <https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/#via-etx-passthrough>. You don't. Follow the guide
"i just recieved a supposedly new mob 7 board elrs from aliexpress that seems to be in 3d mode, is there a way to turn it off in betaflight? it doesn't show as enabled in the motors section.... but when the transmitter is bound it goes all flippy dippy on either side of pitch except dead center.","You need to change the mode using https://esc-configurator.com/ ha, alright. many thanks!"
And then plug in USB cable and it will work?. Because currently I cannot connect to Betaflight,Do I have to solder both pads together or what did the support mean by this: Yes they want you to bridge the two pads It will enter bootloader and you will be able to re flash it. It's what they said in the email
I need to replace my O3 antennas.. Should I go with Stock DJI ones or should I go with different ones like flyfishrc?,Hello I need some help with my fpv drone. I had the tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle analog express elrs and I sold the drone and I bought the babyape 2 freestyle analog Express elrs. And the tx and rx don't want to connect
"What do you consider lr,   i'm planning to fly around 2km's to open sea with my drone. Will the stock suit me? Or do I need to order the long one","Get one of the long flyfishrc ones if you do lr, otherwise get the stock one"
Is it an lr focused quad ?,"no just freestyle 5 inch,   I chase windsurfers, like race car style.  So i'm like 1-2 meters low over the water. I always had analog  trueRC singularity long's. worked perfect Well if you will only ever use it over water then maybe get the long one. Otherwise, get the stock one, it'll be more durable yeah I never crash. oke thanks"
What is considered long range?,"Depends on who you ask I mean I never intended long range flights. Like 5km dives down mount everest. Dont have the battery for that I consider it being after 3km since it's the furthest you can go on a regular 5"" quad with a 1300mah 6s without killing the quad or loosing it. (well, 3km was the most I could do in ideal conditions with a ""regular"" 5"" and a 1300mah 6s) I thing my very max might not be more than 1 even... With a slightly tweaked 5"" freestyle on the same battery I went 4km out doing mountain cruising I ordered the default O3. Can always order another one and change. Thankfully you only need to plug it in and thats it"
This is not the correct way to calibrate batt v ? BF says batt full but it's actually at 13v !,"is this fixable. the shaft is through the bottom pretty sure it's not. it's happened to a number of my motors as well sometimes its fixable if the motor bell is not bent and its just a grain of sand in the bell. e.g. sometimes its a tiny particale of magnetic dust is difficult to remove turns out that the bell just came off the shaft. i put  the shaft back in fully inserted, and put the bell on and it works fine just like the other motors now. just a bent arm to replace now"
i want to make a small airplane but for formfactor id need the propeller on a long shaft like for boats... what could i use  as coupling that is lightweight? or is that a bad idea? i want to use something small like  a 0805 motor and 2inch prop but spinning at high speed,"hey guys i got a 6s 1400mah battery, and while trying to charge after not using it few days i get errors while trying to charge. when testing each cell with a multimeter i see the first cell is at 1.4v while the others are around 3.8v... what to do :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: if it arrived in that state, contact the retailer/manufacturer to get it replaced/refunded"
is there a place to connect leds on this fc?. thanks. wait is this the one to power the leds?,"No, it is the LED_STRIP pad to control WS2812 LEDs oh im sorry for the misunderstanding i meant the place to power the leds. if there is one. idk if this is even possible if you want to do it all on one side"
Can you show the LEDs you are trying to wire up?,those battery wires will get 3-4.2V. you need 5V for most LED strips Bump https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1243212607654068225
yh i know. one color is enough for me. by the way. why dont people add led strips around micro whoops?. it seems like a cool idea,"im not sure if these can go on a drone but by looking at the name i think they do ive had my hglrc motors do this, if you push hard enough they will go back on, however theyll just come back off again after a couple flights those won't be controlled from the LED pad, I think they just need power and GND Does somebody know a nice 3SP pack for 12V around 8-15 aH woah thats so cool why havent i seen this before @Only Bans probably has some even better videos. there's also people who put like little cob lights and stuff on the whoops. <https://www.tinywhoop.com/collections/leds>"
build your own pack maybe? what's the use here?,"i think i prefer the leds being all around the frame This is the densist one I have, at this thickness 200 leds per meter seems to be the limit. Betaflight has a limit of 31 adressable leds so it's a balance to get what you want mkay. im not saying that you are not right but imo that doesnt look like 200 led per meter. just saying Idk, i havent counted. I bought this one off tiny whoop, 200 per meter is the best i could find on aliexpress. Price goes up pretty fast with density so i dont have any of the 200 per meter rolls"
Did I kill my 1s batteries by leaving them charged overnight? I think it was maybe 12hrs from charge to flying. Was getting maybe 2.5 min flight time before and today they all instantly dropped to 3.5v after takeoff and lasted maybe 30 seconds before barely having enough power to lift the quad.,shouldn't kill them. but they could've been on their last leg already Appreciate your reply your always here helping me and others. I don't think so these ones were almost dead since they are only a week or 2 old. I could be wrong though.. I'll have to do some troubleshooting because the charger thinks they were almost still fully charged. Around 4.1ish V
What quad?. mobula6 2024?,"2022 Meteor 65, it had been flying pretty good but I've bashed it up a lot also just check all the main connections. mainly the battery plug and the esc pads Sorry didn't mean to leave @ on. Will do, I'll give it a look over tonight and see. Was just so confused by it earlier if you don't leave @ on then how am I supposed to know you responded lol probably just experience from other servers. ""i'm right here why'd you ping me you idiot"" kinda stuff :KEKw: those people infuriate me. if you don't want notifications then turn em off. doodus. doofus is this battery safe: yeahh, it looked a bit sketchy I don’t think I’ve ever seen an image after the words “is this safe” that is safe"
The 2 or the integra?. Cause the 2 are the best cause they can do everything pretty much,"https://www.getfpv.com/dji-goggles-3.html I guess that makes sense. I just know you all get so many questions already. Don't want to bother anyone. Appreciate you all have a great day! @Yikes. That’s the ones you ideally want, I believe. Cause they do vista, 03, and with some adaptors, analog, ya know if you wanna do some whoops"
Random question. Should you practice flying without googles?. In acro,do you want to fly without goggles
No but will there ever come a time when I have to?,not unless you want to
Wouldn't it be good if somehow someway your googles disconnected?,"line of sight (LOS) has a totally different feel than FPV. It's harder but not much of the skill transfers. I mean, maybe try it a bit just to be kinda comfortable with it, as a tool on your belt your quad is fine even if it falls 3 stories high. and if your goggles disconnected, chances are you can't fly it blind long enough for you to take your goggles off Damn i didn't know it could survive that high of a fall plus the most likely thing to make your video signal fail would be a massive obstruction to line of sight hehe"
Is there any negative to charging my high voltage batteries to 4.35v?,they'll last less long. like life-span wise
Is it significantly cheaper than a pre built one?,Depends on what you want to make
How long did it take to build?. If you don't mind,"I'm quite a perfectionist generally and a lot of things went wrong, so building took me 3 days in total. I also struggle with motivation. You could do it in a few hours if you know how to solder"
What are the tape and zip ties for?. Oh nvm. Thx!,No one ever remembers a fume extractor. I don't want that stuff in my lungs. I love mine. I feel as if that should be on the beginner's list Chanel
why mobula bad? ive heard good about it,"no current will go into the camera if you leave only 1 power wire on. may it be the ground or positive wire I see. I don't recommend buying the Mobula 6 2024 yeah the flying is fun #announcements. the 2024 version, the original one is still good wow thank fuck i read that i was 3 days of buying a mobula or some of the series it's only the mob6 2024 that has qc issues"
ok. if i were to buy a bnf elrs whoop got any suggestions?,"the mob6&7 (non 2024) mobeetle and mblite 6/7 are still good i would go diy personnally. especially since it's a whoop, it's really easy to build truuuuueee. id love to diy a whoop with a mate. ive got a flylens 75 that im setting up now but i want a whoop too"
yeah well all tinywhoops are small. what do you want to do with it ?,whoop small just for indoor freestyle and or race if you want to do racing you have to go with 65mm. which is the smallest size. cause almost all whoop races only accept 65mm
oh ok. does it make any difference to freestyle inside??. size wise,"well, 65 and 75mm are the two sizes people fly indoors it doesnt matter tbh I dont see why 10mm would make such a difference i would say that same but who knows with fpv also, just beware that going with a diy 65mm will require some soldering, and if you set your iron to 440c like some people and wait for 2min with the iron on the board, you will fry it. well it does. it really does i have a little experience soldering other things. i should be ok there"
do you have a 3d printer and some tpu btw ?,"noooo thats pretty much the one thing i dont have and dont intend on buying any time soon i dont have that kind of money. lol BlueFang just buy the Mobula 6/7 non 2024. If you just want to fly then don't diy ive been looking at the mobula 6 and happymodel stuff ok, well if you want my build recommendation for a 65mm betafpv 65mm air frame c03 or fx-17b camera (c03 looks better but has a worse dynamic range) happymodel mobula 6 2024 canopy betafpv f4 5a 1s tbs unify pro32 nano happymodel 0702 26000kv mob6 eco antenna (you can easily build one like it, but if you don't want to, you can just get this one and save a lot of weight)  hq 31mmx3  if you put that together, it's a relatively easy build, and you will have the potential to go ultra light rather easily in the futur, and it will outperform by a lot stuff like the mob6 (non 2024). diy doesn't mean less reliable it took me 45min to build my tinywhoop yes but it was you, for me it took 2 hours to only setup my drone with controller (the Mobula 6 2024). Now Imagine if I build it myself it is really really easy to build a whoop, you just need to plug the motors in, since they have connectors, you solder on the vtx to the aio then tape it on, put the antenna, solder the camera, put the camera in the canopy then screw the canopy and it's done. the software is really straight forward too, you just setup the modes, select a preset, bind elrs (takes 5min using the wifi) setup your osd, check motor direction, then put the props and you can go fly yiiikes i got a problem with my motors on my flylens 75. when i arm the motors everything seems to be normal but the spin up and prop direction"
Actually you are right but how much does it cost?,the prop direction is sorta random and doesnt always go the direction its supposed to go
which FC do you recommend?  This one:,"the betafpv f4 5a 1s is good, it's the lightest you can get that isn't a SuperX (since the diamond boards are discontinued) but you will need a vtx. but also it's not the most durable thing ever if you fly outside like me hold on sorry im gonna watch this last video then annoy you with this problem"
Why ? What's the difference?. Does the FC dont like to fly outside or what? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,"that crashing into concrete at high speed is worse than crashing into carpet at low speed. especially when the fc was made to be gently crashed into carpet Maybe thats why my Mobula6 is dead. I crashed into a metal bar at high speed maybe. the aios we use on 65mm whoops are some really thin and fragile boards that are optimised to save weight, not to get crashed into concrete. if you want to fly outside, a 2"" 2s like a mob8 or a 75mm where you can put a board like the x12 would be ideal since the x12 is much more durable. (the one I had on my toothpick for like 4 months survived through hell and water) yea Mobula 8 was my first option but then I saw the beginner shopping list yeah, but a mob8 isn't great for indoors. the 75mm class is a great middle ground, a 65mm is great for indoors, and an 85mm+ is great at outdoors So you are saying I should buy the Mobula 7. elrs Not what I said, but it's a great whoop for outdoors and indoors At this point I just want a drone which I can fly in peace. With No Errors Well the mob7 is pretty durable, and the stock tune is really good"
How long would it last if I dont crash it?,"But it isn't as good as like a mob8/bassline for outdoors. Sorry, I left my crystal ball at home am i better off trying to tune the pid myslef or using a preset for the flylens i have Take the props off, go into the motor tab, go into ""motor direction"" then into ""wizard"", and you will be able to adjust the direction of each motor. Tiny quads are a pain in the butt to tune, I would say just use the stock tune but its inconsistent, the motors will sometimes spin clockwise sometimes anticlockwise"
Do you have 3d turned on ?,"You can see this in the configuration tab I believe Well, do the wizard and see if works afterward And check that all the wires are well soldered on. And that they aren't bridging"
it also has a problem where ill increase the throttle a little then it does this weird feedback thing where it'll slowly increase the throttle until its maxed. not bridging either i can see through the frame. the motors wires right?,"Oh yea my 5” does that. The issue for me was my radio applies like 2-3% throttle when it’s at “0” just cause nothings perfect, then it feedback loops. I just re calibrated the gimbles and it made it better Hey:)  so the use is watercooling for a VTX,  will use a Water pump that pulls about 1 amp   and possible UV lighting in the future.    Will be for an underwater live camera, analog style.   I don't have a spotwelder tho"
"Hi, is there a compatibility table for all walksnail Camera with VTX combinations?. I can't find any information for this topic",that's just the pid loop doing it's job
so that means its ok?,it tries to stabilize the quad but if it can't then it tries harder and harder and harder ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah if the motors ramp up it's perfectly fine
at higher throttle it wont take off it'll just scoot along the floor. and im pretty sure the motors aren't supposed to be twitchy and jittery right?,"nah. that means either the motor or the esc is dead well shit. all my motors do that oh, that. yeah that's normal the notchy feel is perfectly fine gooooood. got me scared it's just the magnets interacting together with the stator. I thought you mean like they were twitching when you power it up the props look upside down yea the whole thing is upside down. i think theyre mounted upside down to keep them out of view as part of the build yeah the quad is a pusher, doesn't have anything to do with props in view, but you also need to put the props upside down since the motors are upside down"
yea aren't they on upside down?,"you need to put the props upside down relative to how they are mounted on right now so if i flipped it upside down id put them on normally no. you have to put them up side down when you flip the quad. so when it's up right the props are also upright. cause right now it is trying to push air with the wrong side of the prop, so it doesn't have enough lift to fly Oh ok maybe that’s why. Lol that's definitively why Can someone explain too me why whoop drones are not good for freestyle flying they are. cinewhoops aren't, tinywhoops are But bigger whoops so cinewhoops are not good because i have a tinywhoop and would like a bigger drone for faster freestyle flying but i don’t know if i should get a open drone or whoop drone the issue is the drag caused by the prop guards, it was especially noticeable when we used litteral whoops that were like 7cm long and it created a ton of drag and all the momentum of the quad was getting instantly stopped, so basically, if you try to fling the quad, the added drag from the whoops will make it fling less far. if you want a bigger quad  for freestyle, anything over 2"" really, then get an open prop But would you recommend this kit or nah thats shit: https://darwinfpv.com/products/babyape-ⅱ-fpv-drone-rtf whoops are only here so if you crash into the guy you are trying to film (since cinewhoops are usually used for cinematic chasing and stuff) you don't kill him has fast. no Oh well thanks for explaining every kit ever and that will ever exist is trash. it's just a constant"
But for example a crux35 + Cobra X V2 + Radiomaster Boxer ELRS would be good?,"yeah. just do not cheap out on the charger Do you know any other open fpv freestyle drones at around 100 too 200 bucks. I would not want my house too catch on fire :winking_face: yeah but the crux35 is about the ""best"" I know of at this price point, the other bnf in this class I would recommend are at like 250 bucks (like the avionrc ones) Mhm okey then i guess the crux35 is the best. Thank you"
How do I insert a one of those red squishy things into the ESC OR FC?,squish it in. use a screw driver if needed
You can put 2 wires on 5v right?,I have this beeper it says BZ do i connect BZ to BZ+ or BZ- dunno. try both i guess Yeah BZ+ is 5v BZ- is BZ or PWM use 5v and gnd. then connect bz to either bz+ or bz-. its probably bz+
"ELRS should use UART. And you can use a GPS, the GPS itself uses UART, and the compass is on SDA and SCL. That's quite the jank ass FC. Missing SCL too. Is it old?. Looks new but it's missing so much",Yeah it got discontinued Yea I'm not surprised tbh
So no gps for this build?,GPS but no compass. So you know where you are but no direction
What is the quad for ?,"Well then you *need* one. And if you use betaflight, a compass is basically useless. And inav doesn't need it either. That's not that big of a deal since betaflight and inav can work around needing a compass and still perform very well even without one"
So what do i not use scl and sda or TX and RX?,"Yeah well ardu is another story. You just connect tx and rx if it doesn't have a compass/baro If I can't use ardu I will fight with my life to use it, never going back to anything else"
What is so great about ardu ?,"It will do anything you want it to. It's much harder to use and learn but it will do whatever you want, from autonomous sailing boats to race drones. Antenna trackers, rovers Well BF is still better for freestyle. But I see what you mean In terms of ease of use absolutely, I also haven't flown freestyle quad so I don't have a lot of input"
"Well, also, doesn't ardu have pretty bad compatibility fc wise ?. How messed up ? Like what happened?","Oh definitely. Assuming you're just talking about FPV quads i forgot to change my profile and now i dont know how to turn it back to normal. (if this makes any sense) Well about anything. Well you can just take 20min and configure the osd like you are used to With fixed wing FCs they almost always support ardu, and proper autopilots usually only support ardu Or switch the profile back to the old one It usually requires you to manually flash ardu onto them tho"
how do i put words with an odd number of characters in the middle? that net thing doesnt let me do it,Yeah but I don't see what you are talking about give me a sec ill send a picture. that thing
"Yeah I know what the osd is, I mean where are you trying to ""put words with an odd number of characters in the middle"" do you mean you are trying to put something at the center and it is slightly offset when you try to center it ?","Ardu has more freedom and it'll play nicely with whatever you want to add later, it has some more autonomous flight modes, like I'm working on an auto soaring plane yeah. OH SORRY I HAVE TYPED IT WRONG. yeah that is what i meant Well you can't perfectly center it since the betaflight osd works with a grid system that is an even number :(. Also I haven't messed around with osd stuff on ardu so I'm not really sure what kind of support it offers https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1230243684398796911 I am working on setting up a camera in my little glider so I'll let you know what I find It will work on pretty much any FC with 1mb or more flash, just not F411/F722"
"Ok, so f405 and f745 will work ?",I don't know what this means
i know it depends on me if i like it or not but is this good?,"It depends on you if you like it or not  (But you would want to have the average cell voltage, and I like to have the throttle level somewhere)"
like replace battery cell voltage with avg cell voltage or have both?. okay ima add the throttle level. i have a idea. im gonna make my pilot name as >< and it will make a crosshair that is actually in the middle,"I like to have both so I know if the battery is discharged or not. Cause for exemple a discharged 6s looks to betaflight like it's a 5s battery just have only average cell voltage. unlucky if your battery is dead, you'll find out once you try to lift off Have both so if your battery is empty you know it and you don't kill it cluttering osd is lame Killing a battery because you wanted 1 less osd item is lame just don't plug a quite literally dead battery in. it's not hard"
cant you lock the information that it is 6s in the cli thing? (i hope i have typed it correctly),"If you just use both it won't freak out if you ever fly a 5s battery (like if one of your pack has the first cell that died) Most people end up using just the average cell voltage, since plugging in a dead battery is generally not something that happens. You'll also know as soon as you arm that it's dead, and if you have Betaflight locked to 6s it'll yell at you. Well, plugging in a dead battery is something that happens to me quite often. Since I sometimes have an empty battery that fell with the full batteries I said most people. Print some green and red xt60 caps and solve your issue if that's an option. also, leaving batteries discharged for long is kind of awful for them Using the average and battery voltage is easier no, it's a bandaid for a non issue At least with the two you know if one of the cells died. Well I killed one of my batteries this way so it's a bandage for an issue that very much exists. And having the choice between multiple bandages doesn't mean there is only one that is acceptable i think ill just see if i need both after some time Well, either get both or just the overhaul cell voltage and learn the landing voltage of the batteries you use Yes and having multiple solutions doesn't mean only one of the solutions should be used"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) What does that even mean ? (The emojis). I believe it is showing all the time,"that you don't get it and I'm sick of this whole conversation so I give up i think time will say if i need both or not personally, i like cell voltage more, because it's easier for me to understand and I'm not sure why you'd need to know the temperature (unless you're leaving it on the ground for a long time). Temperature is useless, you can just set an alarm if it overheats and that's all you really need it won't overheat mid air, that's for sure. just don't leave it on on the ground for too long and you'll be fine i have core temperature warning on but for the esc there only is esc fail. im not sure if i need throttle position tbh Hey, i hope someone can help me with my DJI Avata 1  sadly i crashed it about 2 weeks ago, tried to fly it today with new props (the old broke) now the drone won't start correctly. im trying to start it with the motion controller and the ""start button"" im getting ""start failed"" in the goggels"
"I don't know, as I mentioned, I never used DJI stuff, so I don't know if they have protections for that too. could you send a picture of the drone with all four props clearly visible?",Yes. The pads labeled TX3/RX3 can be remapped to SCL/SDA in software
and how/where do i set when the alarms turn on?,"okay maybe i saw the problem. the original avata props do have a marking, the master airscrew doesnt..."
Walksnail?.... If it all works it all works,Quit using video tutorials or whatever. Literally grab the box and open the manual. It's all explained there in literally like 3 steps i threw it away. :crying_face:
Why do you need to lift your aio ?,"The ceramic antenna is taller than the gummies. and interferes with the frame Just use another set of gummies. Or use nuts okay.  I was planning on picking up some extra hardware anyway.  I think I've got another set of gummies at least. actually another set of nuts would probably be the most convenient because the screws not liking to stay in while I'm working on it is annoying anyway Using some nuts under it will actually greatly increase flight performance too Basically, with an extra nut you block the screw and it can wiggle around anymore, so less vibrations to the gyro, so a better flying quad"
"makes sense. Another whoop specific question.  My AIO came with a cable to connect the camera with only one end.  The camera came with another cable that is close, but different.  Do people usually hard solder the whoop camera in?. or do you splice the cables?","Both, but I prefer to solder mines, cause often those camera connectors wiggle loose. And if you don't isolate correctly where you spliced the wire, it can cause issues. Also, it's a micro, not a whoop That's what I was worried about. that's true.  First time not working on a whoop. like specifically the caged version Yeah, whoops have ducts/prop guards. If it doesn't have whoops/prop guards it's just a micro I've got a couple of those and this would be my first that I'm both building and without a plastic frame. hard to break the habit in speaking my brain goes ""has an AIO, is whoop"" Well we have some 5"" quads using aios, so that's not a good definition for a whoop no, it definitely isn't (it's very popular for 2004 ultra light 5"" to use aios) that makes sense.  When you can cut off half the board weight, you do it It's also so you can use shorter standoffs, assuming you use analog. Cause the weight of an aio is similar to the weight of a ""true"" 20x20 stack (so not counting the ones that are just a 30x30 but with 20x20 holes) makes sense. I've never looked much into ultralights. I'm gonna run into stuff, so some durability is necessary"
"well, that's a fun video. Which side do you solder. Hard on the camera or the board?","couldn't try it. started to rain .-. it's always the rain :/ if you try it and it doesn't work, feel free to @ me with a video of what happens and a picture of the drone"
Did you put your backup config in?,"I just updated to betaflight 4.5 and now I dont have an osd (HDZero freestyle), I also dont have any osd config options in betaflgiht I did but there was an error, I ignored it because I couldnt figure out exactly what the cause was but that seems to be it this is the same error (applying hdzero preset here). even if I ""save anyways"" it doesnt work that's still a command though :thinkies: yeahhh lol. its strange"
`set vcd_video_system = HD`. could you just try that alone in the CLI?,``` set osd_displayport_device = MSP set vcd_video_system = HD ```
are there still no osd config options in Betaflight?. no tab at all?,"nope, instead I have this error. *and no tab*. well the error is fixed by pressing ""save"" but still no OSD"
I also see this. is there any way to check if I did?,uhh maybe if you do `dump all` it'll list the features. but not sure
and did it do this properly?. Is all the OSD stuff enabled on the configuration tab?,;-;. How is that not turned on by default I don't even know how that's turned off :loudly_crying_face:
That's what I figured. Then I guess I just solder to the plug pins on the camera?,No pads here. Plugs on both. For the plugs you use the one that came with the board
Afternoon all. Do we have any prop guru's in here? :D. Just going through a shopping list for a 3.5 cinewhoop. I am going to be using the Xing2 2205 2300KV motors. I noticed though with cinewhoops people are using various props. From tri blade up to 8 bladed. Surely 8 bladed props will just destroy efficiency. My understanding has always been less props more efficiency?,"Yes, but with less blades you have more noise, a lot more, and cinewhoops are already really noisy with Penta blades props, and more blades also (usually) generates more thrust, so you would want something between triblades and Penta blades, and props are pretty cheap, so get a few ones and see which ones you prefer (I would just recommend you stick with hq, their props are better balanced on average) Cheers bud, ye from what I have been seeing people with 3.5 whoops have been using the hq 8 blade props. to help with that noise reduction Yeah, but 8 blades won't be great for efficiency ill make sure i get hq and just get a bunch like you said and play round with it. On any fpv stores, usually tinywhoops use m1.6 for the aio mounting and m1.4 for the motors yh i need screws to mount my fc"
"is it possible to get a whoop setup. (packs, kwad, charger). for sub $140?. what are the good packs? ik the webleedfpv ones are good, are the tattu ones folded cell?","It's the parent company of tattu who makes the folded cells oh ok. so ima get the tattu 300mah ones since i can get 4 for like 22$ Shouldn't be impossible, but a bit hard since a whoop is like 100$, a whoopstor is like 40$, and batteries are 5$ a piece. You should be able to get 5 for that price yeah 5 i meant. im dumb. didnt check the listing Ok yeah cause tattu sells the batteries by 5 whoopstor is 33. is the nbd hummingbird v3 good You will be stuck with an nbd board tho, which you don't really want"
what about the betafpv whoops?. meteor65 pro etc. ik im gonna need a mobula but its never gonna be in stock istg,"Well, the meteor65 pro is very popular for indoors, but doesn't have the power at all for outdoors, otherwise it's a good quad. #announcements oh thanks. i had no idea Well now you know, I find it a little dumb they didn't ping anyone when sending it i might get the mobeetle 6 or the old mobula then. if i can find for cheap. then ima have to convert to bt2 Mobeetle6 is also a bit underpowered with the whoop frame. Since it uses the first gen 0702 motors that were really underpowered ahh kk. so maybe either the betafpv or the old mob Yeah, if you only fly indoors, the betafpv meteor 65pro isn't bad the plan was to get it for indoors and maybe a little bit on my front porch. the main goal is to get more stick time. and just practice more Yeah the meteor 65 pro will work fine for that, it just won't be very good at like dive recoveries because of the low kv. But you could always go 75mm correct. i could, but like i feel like im gonna feel too big indoors. like flying a 5inch in a small park. i dont wanna feel trapped yk Not really. 75mm is popular for indoors and outdoors i might go mob7 then. or sum like that Yeah, mob7 is a great 75mm i kinda want the betafpv for the sake of lazyness It would be quite a bit better than the betafpv imo i dont wanna solder a new connector. lol Just splice in the new connector, it's pretty easy yeah i mean you rigjt. so my options: mob7. m65 pro. maybe an old mob6 kk. il see if i can find it for cheap. then i have toget 450 packs what  fpv drone size is the best for a begginer who wants to do a bit of freestyle maybe later do some filming and just fly normally. i dont have any plans for racing in the near future i just want something thats nice to fly and still can fit thru some tight spaces when doing some freestyle. if that narrows it down my budget is around 200-250$ for just the drone and i wanna build it myself well, anything between 65mm and 5"" is fine for a beginner (if you are feeling particularly brave you could even say up to 10"" is fine for a beginner), depends on the space you have"
200-250? for a beginner i would recommend 3.5in,"depends on the space they have well i was looking somewhere between 3,5"" and 5"" 3.5in feels almost just like 5inch, while being safer"
ahh so you are flying outdoors yes?,"so, it's not safer, it just has less power while having the same flight characteristics, if you get hit by a 3.5"" you will still cry maybe some indoors flying asweel. aswell*"
"yeah but is it like a big field, a small backyard ?","not really. i have hit myself several times. some light scratches but nothing compared to getting hit by a 5inch. a 5inch could cut down to the bone you are not flying inside with anything above an 85mm whoop i dont have a backyard so i will mostly be going to parks so space is not a problem. oh I hit myself with my 5"", and no, it doesn't cut to the bone at all, it doesn't feel great, but it doesn't cut deep at all in my opinion 3.5in is perfect for parks for a park flier 3.5"" will be better whats the flight duration on both of these maybe even 3"" if it's not a super big park like 4-6min of freestyle for both do you want freestyle performance or a cruiser if you get a crux35 you can fly for freakin 10 years. and you said you want to build right"
with a 250$ budget? you can get a really good powerful freestyle build,with 3-5 mins hard freestyle
"also, in the 250$ budget, do you just need the quad and batteries ? or do you also need the goggles, radio and charger ?","well 250 is max for just the drone and batteries but i dont rly wanna go past that so either 3.5 or a 5"" so more like 200 budget. then ur def looking at 3.5in if the drone lasts long i can maybe spend a bit more so for the frame def volador 3.5in but i just dont wanna spend 400$ and crash it the next day. so prob somewhere around the 200-300 you are gonna crash regardless. but youll be fine. my 3.5in lasted 1 month before i broke a motor. then again i dont fly bandos. but yeah for the frame volador 3.5in. its cheap and durable. for the motors brotherhobby vy1504.5 how much do lipos usually cost more like 16 for a 4s 850mah thats not that bad. whats the deal with 6s and 4s whats the difference 650mah cheaper. and better imo ye but what does the 4s in the name mean"
the more cells the better?,"no. there are pros and cons 6s better. But you need to adjust the kv of the motors. But 6s will give you more power. And more efficiency Yeah for 3.5"" 6s is better if you don't try to hit 250g and you dont get more power. on 3.5 voltage has nothing to do with power if you scale the kv accordingly. 4s 4000kv = 6s 2640kv. you will have the same rpm at the prop Why do you think we use like 1960kv on 6s instead of 1600kv when 1600kv is the scaled kv from 4s, cause when you go higher in the voltage, you can use lower kv that is more efficient so you can have higher kv compared to what you had on 4s if you just compare the rpm doesnt really work on micros It does. Ask @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) on micros you can use effectivley the same She runs 6s on her 3.5"" 4500kv on 4s is about 3000kv 6s. yeah ik. and its not worth it. all you get out of it is less sag But on 3.5"" you usually use like 3600/3800kv, not 4000kv and bareley less sag. no you use 4000kv+. for the best performance And on a 6s 3.5"" you usually use like 2700kv That is a too high of a kv bro 2750 6s = 3650~ 4s. not really People usually use 3600kv on a 3.5"", 4000+ kv is used on 3"" 3600kv is too low. the brotherhobby motors i like are 3950kv Don't make an exception a generality, most people don't run 4000kv on a 4s 3.5"" look at bnfs then. what kv is on the smart35. 3950 Hey guys i got a question i ran a test run on my bench and from one of my motors came smoke however the motor is not burnt and after removing screws the motors spins luckily. But screw are becoming hot i checked all the screws and they are not touching. The motors so there are usecases for both 4s and 6s Hey guys I got a question, I am trying to get into camera drones, what is a good drone with a good quality camera thats on the cheaper side (preferably under 120-150) 6s will give more power than 4s, it's just a fact of life, and it will give better efficiency if you run a directly scaled down kv because lower kv is (usually, you do have some outliers obviously) more efficient"
"kv is just how muhc ""power"" does go to a motor right?","And with 6s you can also more effectively use bigger motors like 1804 which will give a better flight feel, and will be better at spinning higher pitch props im pretty new to this Kv is just a measure of the rpm/volts #camera-drones we have a channel for camera drones so it just means how fast does the motor spin Pretty much. And more voltage on the same kv will make the motor spin faster. And more kv will mean more current draw, so less flight time"
"right so with my budget i should go with a 3.5"" with 6s batteries?. and whats a good budget but safe lipo charger?","Babyhawk uses 3700kv Aos 3.5 uses 3100kv Crux 35 uses 3500kv Baby ape 3600kv Not all bnf use 4000kv (and I didn't cherry pick those, they are just the only 3.5"" bnf I could find at my usual fpv shops). Hota d6 pro"
that can hold only 2 batteries at a time? is that enough. ?,"I would say go 6s, it will fly better with the right motors, but 4s also flies really well, so you can also use 4s if for some reason 6s will be out of the budget"
aand what motors would you recomend for 6s?,"Well, we only have 2 chargers that can charge more than 2 batteries at a time (the hota f6+ and the cybertruck inspired one from toolkitrc) sr if im annoying at this point 1804 or 2004 2700-2900kv 3000kv will work too, but I would recommend staying a little under it"
"alr ty. anything else i should note with 3.5"" drones?","Well, for the frame you want either the grinderino, or the volador vx3.5,  or the siren f35 split, I heard it was good, for the batteries you want 650mah 6s, 550mah 6s will also work even if it will be a bit small. And don't get any speedybee electronics"
no? i wanted to get the speedybee v4 stack. or whatever its called,No. Do not get speedybee. Get skystar or diatone or hobbywing Xrotor instead
whats wrong with them?,"Speedybee will just crap out on you in 2 weeks. Idk how much money they gave to Bardwell to say they are good, but speedybee is bad, get skystar or diatone"
"Alr. And stax is good? Bardwell used it. In the drone step by step guide. But thats 5"" i think","It doesn't look bad, but it's 30x30 so you won't be able to use it anyway on your 3.5"", since you need either a 25x25 aio, or a 20x20 stack, I would stick with diatone/xrotor/skystar personally, simply because I know they are reliable (if you want absolute reliability go with xrotor, it's bullet proof) but"
Whats the difference between an aio and a stack? Aio is just one board and stack 2?,"An aio is a sandwished fc and esc, a stack has two separate boards, one for the fc, one for the esc practically the same on a 5"". sag is extreme even at these sizes. the battery price is the same. no reason not to 6s like usual"
Can drone be bound same way as pwm reciver? From radiomaster,"As far as I know, a pwm and non pwm elrs receiver bind the same way"
@Sea_Kerman bntechgo was the wire you recommended me right? Been about a month since I looked at drone stuff lol,"Hello, I cant seem to get connected to my moonlight threw the goggles X (both updated to latest firmware)"
"What gauge are the smaller wires on a drone like the camera, vtx and GPS wires? 26awg?","26awg is pretty thick for a signal wire, I believe 30awg and sometimes 32awg is used i don’t think there’s a single standard. i asked a similar question (because i wanted to practice soldering wires) and was told it can be anywhere from 26 to 30 awg I can't seem to find any heat shrink for wires that small either I had the same issue, so I just use tape, not the ideal solution, but it works well enough"
Should I buy radiomaster boxer elrs or 4in1? If elrs should I buy it with ltb version?,Elrs. And get the fcc version if that's an option
With ltb?. Its sadly not but i heard i can chnage it even if i buy ltb,Lbt basically means it's locked at 25mw You can very easily change lbt to fcc with the ELRS configurator And vice versa. Just get elrs
Ok. Is fcc legal in europe?,No but yes. Everyone uses fcc even if technically it's illegal. But literally nobody has the tools to enforce it
"About a year ago I bought my fpv drone, a Nazgul Evoque F5X HD 6S Nebula Pro Vista Kit BNF w/GPS By Iflight - RX: TBS CRSF. With dji goggles 1 and           Zorro MAX ELRS - Batteries Included - DFR Edition By RadioMaster. With like batteries and all other stuff you can think of. I think I spend just over 2k or something or even more. What do you think it will be worth if I was to sell it? I tried to set it up but in the process lost interest somehow and now it’s been sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust","(lbt is the rf thing for the eu btw) I'll find something not gonna use tape, may just desolder the original wires Yeah, as I said it's not a good solution, especially on a lr quad. You can also use conformal coating, it works well"
So would it be easier to buy an lbt and then change it to fcc?,"And one last thing if I order fcc wouldnt they see that I ordered it. And idk cancel the shipping or something probably not, however if your importing it, it could create problems with customs yes, also gets it though customs easier I think Ok and is there like any tuto how to change it you just select what you want when flashing the module"
well none of that has to do with binding right?. Did you press the bind buttons in the order given?,I can't seem to be able to pair my moonlight with the goggles X Have flashed the newest firmware on both devices and followed manual only one command didn't go threw in bf
"To use a self powered buzzer as a buzzer basically? Well yeah, kinda the point, of a buzzer even if it's self powered","I snapped of my buzzer pad and wanred to remap rx for example. But i heard that buzzer draws too much current the buzzer pad usually gets pulled low by a transistor to drive more power hungry buzzers. if you have a self-powered one, a pin on the MCU might be able to sink it, but I wouldn't risk it"
Damn it :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. What are my options ?. Any idea ? I have cinelog 35 on 6s maybe a esc buzzer?,I'd risk it. I don't really care about having all MCU pads Haha me too to be honest :p. As long as it flies.and is reliable. I found vifly beacon but it will not charge the battery. Oh wait it has a usb port for charging i may get that instead
What's a good antenna to get for vtx? Has to be mmcx,any omni antenna honestly. it doesn't matter much when it comes to the vtx antenna. 5 dollar flyfishrc ones are nice. you can also get a truerc matchstick and have one that never breaks
What about truerc singularity?,"not worth getting such an expensive antenna for the vtx. unless it's super durable. which the singularity probably isn't yes it is. for a vtx it'll perform just about the same as a 5 dollar antenna Well there isn't any cheaper ones that I can see, and I don't really care about saving $10~ foxeer lollipop. rush cherry. those come in dual packs For 35, all the mmcx antennas are $19"
are these canada bucks or?,This reminds me I need to 3d print the housing for the helical antennas I'm gonna make for my goggles. USD
does anyone know where to buy gimbal stick extensions for the stock boxer gimbals? smth like the pocket gimbal stick extension kit,"there isn't a ""kit"". If you want something simple, get a RadioMaster transmitter with ELRS. then get a TBS source one v5 frame. 1950kv motors. <https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner> This is one option I was looking in to. https://www.getfpv.com/fpv-quad-kits/diy-drone-kits/beginner-diy-fpv-drone-bundle-qav-s-2-bardwell-se-5-dji-goggles-2-dji-o3-air-unit.html.

Any quick and dirty tricks to make them say in a bit better?","Tape around the battery. also, next time you should get folded cell batteries probably with a bt2 or a30 connector as you'd get more flight time and performance. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250 Hmm not sure if it will fit the width but thickness wise it might deffo work.

"can anyone explain to me the difference and link between uarts, serial ports and tx/rx please?

Serial RX on the ports tab. CSRF on the receiver tab?,"Hello, my RX is a constant green / blueish colour but I can't seem to see the buttons pressed in bf"
Does your radio say you're bound?,"no, but if i got to the [Bind] it almost instantly binds you should just use binding phrases No like I turn my Tx off my Rx starts flashing colours I turn tx on the Rx stays greenish"
"anyways, it doesn't have a C or full bars on the top left in your radio?. Can you open up the ELRS lua?",There's a model match setting somewhere
yeah i see it. do i click on?,turn it back off. we're just kind of checking everything that could be wrong. back out of the lua. go to your model settings -> mixes tab
Not drone related but this is smart people here who might know solution.  I need a bluetooth adapter for Jack in headphones.   So one bluetooth adapter part goes into Output and other part goes into headphone input. Any such adapters on market?. Basicly turn wired headphones into bluetooth but with jacks,CH1 0.0 -100 100 -> CNT
"So, your uart is set to the correct serial rx, your receiver tab is set to csrf, you have wired it tx to rx rx to tx on the same uart, model mismatch is off, your mix and output tab is fine and you're bound properly?. Plenty, but they're often pricey",could you show the wiring I guess. if no inputs are working in Betaflight But i need both sides adapter. I need a bluetooth jack to jack in. and bluetooth reciever to plug headphones in I coloured them so it wouldn't be a paint in the ass to figure out lol where's t7. T6. okay but if I were to believe your wiring. with the colors. your rx pad is going to rx. and your tx is going somewhere random

DRL still hadn't implemented 6s and most of the parts on Liftoff you could build a quad with were ancient.. You probably wont be able to find the exact parts you used in any sim.. Freerider is good on your phone too, with an OTG cable you can plug in your open/edgetx radio and play at work while you're on break. But there's no customization."
This is for that motor. Scroll down for the graphs https://www.racedayquads.com/products/t-motor-v2808-1300kv-motor?currency=USD&variant=39870326702193&stkn=ed68f1cb6bdd&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=20014426060&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3tCyBhDBARIsAEY0XNkyd65By-56BJ9Z_Jbzn4zd3vuwtECaGl_CBouvsqB5oOjFFnhitQQaAhD8EALw_wcB. It seems that that’s not the f 90 it seems but that’s what to look for,"Depends of motor kv, size, prop size, prop number of blades, and prop pitch. Usually motors have tables showing draw and efficiency of the motor with different props well prob size is probs 7 inch but ya u need all the rest of that info to make a rough estimate It can also vary from the number of instruments(gps, barometer, etc) and the vtx power but that would probably add +/- 5A. Maybe more depending. For a estimate most of what you need is to decide on a motor 7 in props, 1300kv tmotor F90. I may need to do 8s Ok so probably 280 ish. At absolute maximum, thanks, forgot tmotor has those fancy graphs. That's a lot of 18650's"
is your esc a blheli esc?,"then it runs things like dshot, does firmware updates through the flight controller and can be configured, submits telemetry and such. so it needs the tx and rx to communicate that right. so i can use the s1/2 pads on the fc for one of the wires. sorry im just tryna wrap my head around this. i get confused when its tx to rx and vice versa <https://oscarliang.com/esc/>. this seems to explain a bit The ground of the ESC needs to go to the ground pad on the FC, the signal wire also. The power wire is a power output and it's used for powering an RX, your FC doesn't need power from the ESC so you don't need to wire this. On my wing I used this 5v ESC output to run the lights lol"
"isnt t for telemetry, s for signal and g for gnd?. i dont think mine has 5v out from the esc thats why im still confused. cos ive got 1 pad on the fc for a signal and 2 from the esc. im making a wiring diagram in paint rq :face_with_tears_of_joy:","I'm not sure actually I don't have telemetry on my ESC, I was wondering why it's called ""T"" and not ""5V"". But on that diagram it's where the 5V would be the wiring diagram on the iflight website says its tx soooo you want to connect the telemetry wire to any rx pin. I think the Speedybee FC literally has a telemetry plug thing on it. with a uart nicely for it yeah im using rx 2 from the telemetry for sbus sbus :loudly_crying_face: but there is other spare uarts. i dont have the budget for elrs ok :loudly_crying_face:. i will oneday sell all my kit and get modern stuff with elrs and life will be good. but for now i must persist literally sell your sbus stuff and you probably have the budget to buy like double that in elrs i have a jumper t16 - the one with the messed up ribbon cables and i didnt get the free fix cos it was fine for me until a few months after the saga 2 r-xsr's  and even a flysky receiver from my first quad. plus i wanna get digital stuff too. but i dont fly enough to justify spending on upgrading. anyway The cost of loosing a build just because of the range limitations of legacy systems is gonna be much greater than buying entry level ELRS gear"
i dont fly enough to consider losing stuff :loudly_crying_face:. year 12 got me cooked bruh. does this look alright?. or do i need to switch the t and s wires. or do i need to send the s wire to an rx pad. sorry im confusing myself at this point,s goes to s2. t goes to rx4
alr lemme update my 10/10 diagram and double triple check. do i need to use the ground pad at all?,yes the ground goes to the signal ground oh wait facts im silly for that one. sweet thankyou vm!
nah cos i browse and see fpv stuff in freedom units all the time. can anyone help me get my channels to move on ardupilot?. got the rxsr bound with just a solid green light and solid blue light which is sbus output. i think I may need to change parameters on mission planner but not really sure. ive got this set in serial ports. and the rx is connected to the sbus pad with the s.port wire going to rx2 on the FC. if anyone has any input please @me as im heading to bed :slightly_smiling_face:,"Damn legacy systems... I fly fixed wing with some guys and they're on FRSKY and Futaba and they get signal warning alarms when the plane is in VLOS 50m away :Harold:. I even stick ELRS in my VLOS only fixed wings.

XM+ is supposed to go 1km and I've had that have appalling signal 50m away behind a tree. Radiomaster pocket: $65 Happymodel Ep1: $15  Now you're on ELRS or an ELRS TX module for like ~$30-60 This too, I just quite like the pocket. I run everything on ELRS now, no need for a radio running a 4 in 1. i think id go for a boxer since i already have a 'traditional' form radio although it would be nice to try game pad style. besides im in australia so everything costs double. cos currency conversion. ik it doesnt actually cost more but 50 sounds alot cheaper than 75 or whatever it is yk it shouldn't. you should be used to your currency"
Hello! I have radiomaster zorro with ELRS support and I've just bought a prebuilt drone with tbs receiver on it. What is the best way to go with this? Switch to a transmitter that supports tbs - like tbs tango 2? Buy and solder ELRS receiver on the drone or find tbs module and somehow add it to my radiomaster zorro?,"Buy an ELRS receiver. They're very cheap, far cheaper than buying a module. Elrs receiver will definitely be cheaper and in the end the better solution"
I just feel like tbs is the golden standart or am I wrong?,"That's very outdated. For a while now ELRS has been the golden standard. TBS fell behind quite massively. In an apples to apples comparison (900mhz elrs Vs Crossfire, or 2.4ghz elrs Vs tracer), elrs wins on range by quite a lot, even with a higher packet rate. Additionally, ELRS is open source so you have so many manufacturers making receivers with ELRS. Happymodel, radiomaster etc. TBS are more likely to be out of stock which can prove to be a PITA when you need replacements Even when considering the more common 2.4ghz ELRS, the range is incredible."
Aint worth buying chinese antennas?,"Either E (get the hdzero monitor) or C, a straight rp-sma to sma that is pretty thick (the thicker the inner copper wire, the lower the resistance, the lower the dbm loss, so don't get the super thin and super long ones)  (or B if you feel confident you can resolder those tiny pads) I mean, half of the antennas in fpv are from china, but cheap crappy antennas will just destroy your range For just a mob7 maybe. If you’re just flying around your house A football field (lenght) is maximum i can go. Lets count like that I would still get some good antennas, since 400mw can easily get blocked by trees and stuff"
That HD zero monitor cost more than goggles twice as múch. :smiling_face_with_tear:. Are worth buying antennas on AliExpress?,"Then just use the goggles I mean just saying :D Just get a truerc core and a pico patch, it's like 30€ here for the two"
Hmm do you think are those worth buying when i ll be using that only little bit? When some People want to see?,"Worth buying is subjective What Range do you think ev800d has (clear Range). Doesnt need to be right just what you think I am not the right person to ask that (bought a 100€ monitor and a singularity+truerc x-air so I was able to show *once* my fpv footage to someone). Can't tell you. Depends on the obstruction and vtx output power and antenna setup. But I would imagine, in a perfect world without any trees in the way, you can easily get a few hundred meters away with a mob7 and decent antennas"
With those antennas what came with it. :D. I mean its not worth it if i am not gonna show it much i mean adapter looking cheaper. Or shoud i solder rather?,Use an adapter. Probably a few hundred meters away if there is no obstructions I have 3 antennas for my goggles so 1 will go to monitor and 1 will be normal there ig. I dont think it will improve Range much. Thanks for help btw :)
I need rp-sma to sma right?,If you have rp-sma on the goggles and sma antennas yeah
Rp-sma pin goggles and antenna sma pin. So I need rp sma hole to sma hole right. Shoud i order from aliexpress?. Do you think its safe to order this stuff or from my country?,I'd say no. If I knew your country maybe
Ye i tought about that aswell. Because from france will be big shipping. Do you think they will give me hole hole or pin pin?,you would want a straight or 45 degree connector imo. but the rp-sma->sma should be what you are looking  for I wanna get all 3 types :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Just in case the sma->sma and rp-sma->rp-sma aren't adapters. just like an extension No no i mean like 45° 90° and 180° One of those antennas i wont use so the left one needs 90° the Right top needs 180° and bottom needs 45°
At least any suggestions maybe. Lets say under 100. ?,"hdzero monitor is the only good one I can think of right now. but if you  can handle a little diy magic, you can build one yourself"
you gonna use it for spectators i assume right?,"you can also just output video from the goggles to the monitor I am not sure if i shoud rather sell ev800d and buy new or rebuild ev800d you will get a far better signal then using the ev800d receiver (wont be used as often for sure). Hmm good idea. Idk, what is your opinion just get a cable to connect the ev800d to your goggles I mean i wanna have display not half box"
"Hey guys, I just did a search through a few of the channels and didn't find an answer for my question: Before I go into a rabbit hole, I was wondering if it would be realistic to diy I sub 250g camera drone with a better camera than a DJI mini 4 pro, or am I better off just picking up a used mini 4 pro ? The goal is to stay within canadian sub250g laws, good for photography, have fun building, and come out ahead money wise at least 200-300 over a used mini 4 pro to make it worth my time","Idc rn about connecting to my goggles. I mean if its better go rebuild ev800d or buy new display you should have a 3.5mm input/output on the goggles and the screen. both will be fine options, I would say just use the ev800d since you won't be using it often"
Is it worth the 80 grams of filament?,"#camera-drones but also, it's rather unlikely you will find any camera and gimbal that are both better,cheaper and as light as the ones in the mini 4 pro, simply because dji has bizillions of dollars to throw at the problem. 80g of filament is cheaper than a new display 6 hour of print time :smiling_face_with_tear: i am very impatient just run it this night sleep on the couch, or move the printer I live in a flat so there isnt much options That's what I figured. I guess no fun project for me for now haha. Thank you for the quick reply it's what I did when I did a 12h print to do a 0.01mm layer height 3d benchy I rather wont ask why you would do that maybe it was 0.001mm layer height, I don't recall. cause why not. tho I would still suggest you head to #camera-drones so they can help you choose which drone to get"
Cheap 50 euro monitors arent worth it right?,"depends. but probably not what is dshot_bitbang It's an implementation of bidirectional Dshot, you also have a timer based one, but that's all I know"
"Hello, I have dji goggles v2 on my way. Can I somehow steam view from them to my iphone? Usb-c/wireless?

"I have an old 3DR DIY quad. It has a Turnigy 9x8c controller and receiver. In the controller, I don’t see any models programmed in. How do I add my drone?","Besides being *incredibly* outdated, the 9X ran OpenTX firmware. Almost nothing about the OpenTX UI has changed in the 12 years since it came out, so literally any tutorial on YouTube should suffice. Quads have come a *very* ***very*** long way since then though, so if you need help with the old firmware, there's a very good chance you'll be on your own, as there are *very* few people here that were even in the RC space that long ago, even fewer remember enough to help with those firmwares"
So it does work?. On the Website its Not made for a30 but on a forum a guy said it works,Does any1 have 1s lipos with an a30 connector and User the whoostor to charge them yes just about everyone with a tinywhoop here does bt2.0 and a30 can plug into each other. please make very sure you're buying folded cell batteries. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250
got new motors for my mobula 7 hd and now it dosnt fly motors dont idle and one motor is turning off and on and beeping at me on the motor test?  anyone know what might be the issue?,Search how many amps your aio can provide. for 5v
how does it fly?. before the motor switch was it fast or was it slow,no it did the fale safe stuff. it was just eh before hand i want more punch.
u got some recordings?,"I've been recomended this by someone these motors. RCINPOWER 1002 22000KV why the heck is my fpvdrone erupting like this when i arm it 1002 aren't great for 75mm whoops I searched for a bit and have no idea where I can get this info.

It's not an amp issue cuz the others pop up just fine when I boost the master try setting the rampup power higher in the esc configuration software. or startup power, however it's called. basically this #deleted-channel"
"Hey, I bought a runcam thumb pro for my crux35 and I have a few questions.   Can I just solder the wires to my FC 5V pads ? I heard conflicting opinions online that it could overload because it draws too much for the amperage rating of the fc.  Is the given mounting thing for the runcam compatible with the mounting thing on the crux ? If not how can I fix that (I can access a 3D printer but it would be a bit of a hassle, and even then I wouldn't know what to print)","yeah im on a budget and have a 35a spare stack so i wanted to know if i could use it on 4s. if not I wouldn't on a 5"", but it will work great on a 3.5"" or 4"" 4s then im jus gonna get 6s 60a someday. when i have the cash. kk. i might build a 4in lr then with my old 1404s. make analog great again is so valid yeah, I wanted to do a joke about M.A.G.A. since it was the nuclear codes for  the usa during the trump area, and Make ~~America~~ Analog Great Again was the best I found, and I genuinely like analog too"
SD Card Cooked?. Cant open my FCs SD card to access my BB data BF reads it. Did a Format and it seems to be fine now,Ok so there is only 16mb in my blackbox and it always seems full even if I fly for only 10 seconds. Is that normal bcz I can't seem to use the data and idk if it's me who's doing it wrong or jus the storage filling up too fast

i wanna conformal coat my 5 inch analog quad. ive got an acrylic based one. Is there anything i need to know before i take it appart and coat everything? also are acrylic based coats fine to use?,"Don't cover the barometer, buttons or any connectors"
outta these two which one had more range?,"you need to pick the elrs version for the boxer. and the radio on the right is basically garbage what's called ""2.4 elderly"" for some reason on your screen"
ok thx. so this is a decent starter radio?,The Boxer is pretty much a forever radio when you pick ELRS. don't really need to upgrade it
perfectt. and u said the dji goggles werent ideal?. or something like that?. cas they mad expensive,Digital goggles and VTXs are expensive. The Integras are cheapish. DJI is very proprietary and is expensive VTX wise. Walksnail is an alternate option
ok. but still work with the cinelog30. ?,"If you pick the DJI option for the cinelog yes ok ty. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) last question i swear. which is better the V2 is easier to upgrade and you can put analog and stuff on it. integras are newer and very locked in, but will probably be supported longer https://tenor.com/view/kiss-gif-1495747928058999276"
How do I go about making a quiet drone?. With a clicker?,wtfos makea the v2 the best dji goggles honestly. opensource guys made two abandned products still the best dji options in 2024. but dont pay 461 euros. its an old unsupported product and buy at a price that refects that or you can say most white color radio are garbage
"absolutely not?. what a weird thing to say dude. I'm a Walksnail enjoyer. High pitch props, many blades. and efficiency","I know I'm just agreeing with you that v2 are better than goggles 2 I'm just telling you :p. I know the v2 are better, some will disagree though goggles 2 has video out via USB to an ipad or phone which might be very important to some peope. wtfos can do this kinda but not great.

"Folks, I was watching Bardwell, and a guy said ""I don't think any all in one (ESC) supports 2205 (motors)""  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJj4U9yfY9s @ 1:55)   That got me curious. My build uses a MAMBA F55_128K BL32 4IN1 ESC 55A 6S, and my motors are Brother Hobby 2808 1350kV. Am I going to be in trouble?","55 amps is 55 amps. your motors likely don't pull that much, so you're okay. try to avoid aio's when you can though, it's just inconvenient. diatone is a good brand too right, also consider that right now I'm on 7042 bi-blades"
really? I thought they were the standard,"well, I've ran the build on intofpv forum, ppl said it were OK :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: (nervous) yeah OK but nothing past OK. brother hobby themselves recommends 80A. really anything 5"" and above you just want to do stacks"
usually more than just fc and esc too. but 55 amps is still low. is this a long range build?,"then you're most likely okay. just never try to go full throttle lol. it could maybe handle a blip or two of full throttle. but I wouldn't do it. also, going 915MHz ELRS instead of 2.4GHz is basically pointless for this build"
"> just never try to go full throttle lol hmmm, risking frying ESC? Upgrading BLHeli would give me EDT, so I could monitor temps on the OSD. But the recommended version is the one I'm using already, which won't support EDT.  > also, going 915MHz ELRS instead of 2.4GHz is basically pointless for this build you say that because I'm on digital VTX? makes sense. I have a few big gain directional VRX antennas that I plan to try with. But I'm still exploring the limits. If ever needed I may switch it back to 2.4GHz. However, I have a 2W 915MHz module that I think it's cool, so I wanted to use it :grinning_squinting_face:","You should probably upgrade to AM32 firmware-wise. and yeah, you would risk up blowing the ESC going full throttle but your li-ions probably can't handle that anyways I have one LiPo though, and 2 full-sends Li-ions 915MHz ELRS won't really give any benefit over 2.4GHz if your video system is 5.8GHz or maybe even 3.3GHz. your video would always cut out beforehand, interference-wise really matters on where you are but with gemini on either that wouldn't really end up bothering you at all never even heard of it It's like Bluejay but for the 32-bit ESCs I'm going to search about it. I'm migrating from BF to iNav tbh, still configuring stuff. I may also try Arducopter at some point, I'm more into the automation side of things I've decided to skip on iNav. I'm just going Ardu. I don't really see the point of iNav Neither do I to be honest, but since I'm here already, I figured I'll give it a try, Still building my GCS btw. I'm building my first wing at the moment but sadly I have to leave the country soon. not enough time for me to figure it all out nice, some day I plan to play with wings. good luck with your travel and project o/ whats a good tempreture for the drone what part of the drone"
like what should I avoid?. I think its the vtx. but i cant tell,"vtx hot = bad. if you're on the bench, point a fan at it or put it in pitmode I need numbers. atm fan is on it and its 57c most people won't have numbers. most people ring the alarm when it gets uncomfortable to touch transmitting video with the drone stopped for more than a minute for me is already concerning. especially under the Sun.. especially on hot places walksnail sucks for that, to the point people put power switches on the vtx"
had to drill a hole on my goggles lol. what ESC current rating is recommended for my build?,"you'll be fine at 55 since low throttle. hobbymotor doesn't seem to have a test chart for that motor which is obnoxious. but they recommend 80a for an 8"" prop true.. I might start to think for a 80A, IDK, better safe than sorry depends on the cost. people seem to pick hobbywing xrotor for pure esc reliability"
What motor are we talking about ?,"Brother Hobby 2808 1350kV with 7042 props A hobbywing xrotor will work just fine then, I know people who run some 10"" macro quads on 65A (with some 3115 1050kv motors)"
this is the current one: Mamba F55_128K BL32 4IN1 ESC 55A 6S. what do you think? Emilia said for me to avoid full throtle,"I would go with hobbywing personally, just because it's basically indestructible so long as you don't try to draw 80A for 5min, even if mamba is still very reliable, but, better safe than sorry, especially when it's a little hard to find an lr quad 7km away from you, even with the gps coordinates, it's already hard to find one that fell 1km away. So, if you extrapolate a little from the 2808 1500kv with a 6"" 3.5"" pitch prop that draws 47A at full throttle, the 1300kv on a 7"" prop shouldn't draw more than like 55A, so yeah avoid it, especially since it's a rough estimate that I pulled out of my butt, but it's an lr quad, so you would melt the li-ion packs before the escs burn yeah, I should really pay attention to the current draw and ESC temps during these first flights then. also this hobbyking xrotor 80A ESC is huge, I'll need to check if my Rekon7 will fit it. (we use some 35A to 45A rated li-ions for lr, so you would need a Ns like 5-6p if you want the li-ion to not melt at full throttle). You can also get some individual escs. You can get some foxeer 80a, or some apd 80f3x iFlight Fullsend 22.2V 8000mAh 6S Li-ion 15C is my li-ion If you are really stressed about life you could even go with the apd 200f3xv2. (But that one is overkill for anything other than a beast class quad). So it's rated for half of the amps the motors would pull a full throttle. But you shouldn't go over like 40% in an lr flights anyway hahaha, too expensive! (just check the p/w ratio so you know where you will be). Yeah I know, they are already overkill for most beast class, it was just a joke"
Do you know the auw of the quad ?,"Not with the 15C battery, as I'm still waiting it to arrive. Without the battery with weights 590g. With a 4S 5000mAh I have here it adds up to 1096.3. (This bat. weights 506.3g) The battery weights 896g so it adds to 1486g. 1.48kg (it also has a test with the GF7042) Yeah. Wait I'm stupid, I forgot to account for the fact there is 4 motors. You would be at like 25% actually"
my bottleneck is the 15C bat or the ESC?,"The battery. It can deliver 120A total, and the esc can deliver 220 total (with the 55A mamba esc). So as I said, the battery will melt before the esv"
So I should keep the motors below 50% throtle on the 15C?,"Yeah, you shouldn't go over 50% throttle while hovering. Stay at around 30-35% during cruising. And you can go higher if you do a dive or what not, but just don't stay too long at high throttle Current draw is jumping right into my OSD tonight after this chat. my project ToDo list keeps on growing, but hey, many many thanks. I think we have chat before, I remember your nick.. many thanks to you and Emilia That being said. I just checked the 8000mah 6s full send listing and they say it's rated for 45A discharge. So maybe don't push it too hard, cause the 40T have a 35A discharge rate, and in a 6s2p you have twice the discharge rate so 70A. So that is a 17A budget continuous, so don't do too much acro while you fly"
so the bat is in fact a 8.75C? (70A/8A). IDK if that's how it's calculated tbh,"I guess, but that will still let you go to like 50% throttle, just don't go too much higher for long. And yeah, the C rating is calculated like that (even if they do play with the numbers a bit)"
"monitoring current draw on the OSD should be enough, right?","ok, tomorrow I'll revise this whole chat. I'll take some notes. Sir., tremendous appreciation. thank you so much I'm going to drive to the gas station, buy some stuff and sleep, almost 3am here. cya, stay safe!"
Is it a signal wire (like say the wires between the camera and the fc) or a power wire ? (Like a battery/motor wire),be use for the receiver and also other stuff on the board. nothing for battery or motor 30/32awg will work fine
fk me that is small no?,same as for any size quad Even if some crazy people use 26awg
"I bought a used Foxeer Wildfire analog module and got two patch antennas with it. As I understand it, a better option would be to use 1 patch and 1 lollipop antenas combo? Im plannig to buy foxeer Lollipop V4 Plus, 10cm one. Im missing something or it will be good?",That isn't a tinywhoop
?. what argument are you trying to make and win here?,"2.5inch isn't a tinywhoop. https://quadmula.com/products/djinn-f25 Well you said for any size quad, I'm just saying that 28awg would be heavy for a tinywhoop stack mounting is 20x20 and vtx mounting is 20x20 that makes such an incredibly small difference. if you care about weight savings so much as to change the wire gauge from 30 to 32, might as well just use enamel single strand wire"
(>@_@)> i don't care about weight not sub 250 build. just want to know what is good size so i don't get roasted again from the discord. so 28 awg? or 30 awg?. because 32 awg i ain't solding crap to anything that small,"That's actually not a bad idea, I'm probably going to do this on my next tinywhoop whichever is more available. I'd say 28 is more common"

Any such thing as a zoom lens for an FPV camera?,why is my drone erupting like this when im just slowy accelrating the throttle Props on backward/spinning wrong direction
"wait, so just swap the prop direction?",no. You make the props spin in the correct direction. Send a pic of the motors tab in betaflight
………. fuck me. reorder motors then?,no. Take the props off. And check if each motor spins in the correct direction Good. Wait no. Uncheck motor direction is reversed because you’re going props in instead of props out. Or use the motor direction wizard to flip them all. I recommend the latter because props out is better
so press rorder motors?,Also check if the motors are assigned correctly. Spin motor 1 and see if the rear right motor spins
every motor is assiged correctly. try the drone agian then?,"but i didnt change anything, the motors are still spinning the same way You unchecked motor direction is reversed so now the fc knows you’re props in not props out. They should rename that to propeller direction"
It would probably interfere. could you put it in the front?,"If you have space, I'd legit print like a mast for it. Or at least a mount where it's above the VTX antenna Probably can't out it at the front. Only option right now is to have the antenna slightly off to the side.  @Vitroid ye I've seen people prints masts for there GPs. I'll have a look into that. Using foxeer m10q 250, thought the performance was lacking a bit.. That would explain it then. I'm curious if there is something i can get to charge my batteries all at once but i think the answer is no because of the mix of types and mAh. i have a Hota D6 pro and charge 2 batteries at a time. i have 2 gnb 530mah hv lipo. 2 gnb 720mAh hv lipo. 3 R-line 550mAh lipo(non hv). Generally for people like you Hota chargers don't get recommended. Usually a cheap route would be getting a bunch of ToolkitRC chargers with a strong power supply @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) wait whats wrong with the hota d6 pro. i did a bunch of research before i bought it It's more expensive in your use case well its already bought, quite a while ago like last year. also the batteries i meantioned are all 4 cell"
"Wanna ask what connector is more commonly used ph2.0, xt30 of XT60?","bt2, a30, xt30 and xt60. they all have different purposes"
Oh okey nice i was thinking about it aswell. Only difference between pH 2 ans xt30 is size?. Or maybe how much current it can handle?,ph2 is garbage and you shouldn't use it for anything. it's about current it can handle and durability
Shoud i rather buy 18650 battery charger or solder up XT60 to 18650 doble case so i can charge on my charger?. What awg cable shoud i get,should i repair my 3.5in with new motors and a new frame. or should i get a tinywhoop. i have about 130$
which one do you want?,"i dont know. to be honest Mobula 7 is inside and outside :D i have no idea how a tinywhoop flies Can do freestyle but harder if i had a sample of how it flies tinywhoops don't fly fantastically if you're only doing outside. but they do fly EVERYWHERE i want to learn inside you can rip the thing in a neighborhood, mall, wherever you want my friend has a th3. but idk if thats gonna be anything like a modern tinywhoop I have mobula 7 and its great inside and can withstand some wind outside with the performance 65mm rigs have now. mob7 is nice but i want something for exclusivley indoor. since i have a 3.5in. i want a 65mm thats for sure just fly it exclusively indoors then if you're willing the risk it the mobula6 2024 is the best BNF wise its too big. too fast otherwise get the meteor65 correct. but i cannot take the risk tbh. i cant afford to. thats the plan. and then upgrade it over time. with 0702s and a better frame you will have to make sure it has a bt2.0 or an a30 plug on it. it's crucial im not getting a mob7, i want a 65mm no matter what. if course. yeah it has bt2 i just dont know, i barley have space in my house anyways"
Anyone answer what cable shoud i get for xt30 and 60. ?,"dont get xt30. get bt2 or a30 Nah for other project :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Ev800d is big fat and i aint using it so wanna make it to display. With 18650 batteries ahhh. then like 20 is fine i mean you don't need to fly in your house, like you can actually just fly it anywhere... maybe watch some botgrinder whoop videos to get inspiration XT30 would be 18-16AWG, XT60 14-12AWG. You can vary those based on current and overall cable length (larger AWG for longer wire or more current) id say 20 is fine. tbh For what doges is doing I think I'd agree. Short run, low current yeah its not gonna be drawing much"
May i get 1 cable? I mean XT60 will be used for charging 18650 with charger  and xt30 will be for powering ev800d with 18650 batteries,"im just reallly conflicted bc i want a whoop but also i want to fly my big quad too Top left is hardly spinning I did a goggle cable with an XT60 and 20awg at one point tbh, about 30in long The tinywhoop is most likely never breaking, it means you'll always have something to fly meaning you'll have the money to spend on the 3.5"" later they are hard as shit to break. waittt. nvm im getting the whoop. i can get gates. bc whoop gates are cheap. and i can put them on my roof and shi. that will be soooo cool that would be cool as hell lol So uhm what shoud i get i just wanna get something short nothing like 1 meter long. 10 cm maybe. Not long Who would be the guy/channel to help me find a drone for real estate that's around $500 you want a real estate drone. as in indoors. fly throughs no lol like still shoots around the house i know nothing about drones so one that will take still photos. of the house then you are looking at a camera drone i was think of DJI but idk anything. yes yep. dji. probably a mavic Is that a type of dji im not really equipped to awnser this i dont know much about camera drones. yeah"
Will a broken coil in a motor ruin that motor?,"that’s way more than $500 yep thats what i was gonna say what about DJI Mini 3 (DJI RC-N1) i used to have an air 2. i really liked it for dji oh yeah, i kinda forgot about those. i was thinking about the current generation of mavics but i got bored really quick bc its slow and i cant do flips and i have tiktok adhd brain drones under 250g don’t need to be registered or anything over 250g needs to be registered with the FAA and you need a p107 license. or whoever else is flying the drone"
is that hard to get? like is it worth to go over 250,the part 107 can be a bit of a chore but rego is easy. just pay your $5 and get your trust cert i just need the best drone for still camera shots that won’t work in this case. trust only applies to recreational use. and this is a commercial use
still gotta get it along with the part 107. and the rego. 4:3 or 16:9?,"the trust cert is easy to get though. the actual p107 license is going to be the hard part. if you’re okay with going through (what i believe is) a somewhat tedious licensing process, a >250g drone will probably get better shots. but if you don’t want to deal with that, there are still good drones under 250g. i don’t really have any specific recommendations, but that would probably be a good thing to decide first I would like 3:2 but 4:3 is fine get a mavic air 2 then. it does 48mp 4:3 shots"
can i get this new on dji website?,(as long as you’re okay with going through the certification process) no grab it used of like ebay or fb marketplace. goes for around 300-500 usd with the flymore
Now if i dont want to go trough the cert what should i get?,rego is easy. just a sticker and a $5 fee. mini 3 pro you still need to get the remote pilot certificate though. which makes things more complicated
is that not just the trust?,not for commercial flying
Does anyone here own ev800d?,"if you’re just doing it for fun, then trust is all you need but they want to do real estate photography. so they’d need the full certification"
Are you willing to dissable it? :D,Damn. I wanna know what version you have. :/ already killed a pair of goggles tearing them down. not again Oh oke :D. If you have newer version for sure. Ig i might get the DJI Mini 3 Pro or the DJI Mini 3 there’s an exemption in P107 that makes it legal to fly recreationally with a TRUST certification. but that’s different from an actual RPC i think
You have sma hole connector on em?,"commercial flying is such a headache. RP-SMA it really is. the FAA really doesn’t make things easy Hmm so that means you have the same thing. You have after market antennas on em or same ones they came with so glad im leaving this all behind soon. stock Oh okey thanks. Ig i am not the only one who has this type of goggles :D im leaving the states they going back to kangaroo land. to hop around. and have closer-by furry cons. like any cat would want i will be living a good day plus away from every single one. or any major city because small town is nice and we own a house there. we could move to Adelaide i guess ill have a drivers licence so i can drive trains are way nicer. you just kind of sit and do whatever you want vs paying attention and endangering yourself heres one of the cons little overnight train or cheap plane or a 13hr drive then spend a few days on the beach. can get there and back on a about 3 tanks of diesel eventually you'll learn how unfun driving is lol yeah. with a car i can bring a MTB and do some trails too it’s not that bad tbh. just put on some music and let your brain autopilot esp when every road is 500km+ of this oh yeah, that probably wouldn’t be that bad. just really, *really* long stick on a movie and fall alseep. ill either wake up at my destination or i wont maybe don’t do that :loudly_crying_face:. but like an audiobook. or really long playlist that entirely depends on the specific person. I know that it would be too overwhelming for me. and for my SO it's too boring i guess, yeah. maybe i just got lucky can confirm this is insanely boring. even worse from Sydney. the downsides of a massive country with nothing inside it roads suck but at least there is stuff inbetween the places yeah, i think i might actually go insane on a road trip in australia oh its not that bad. just enjoy the radio static. and the nothing thank fuck our long distance car had a dvd player doesn’t help when you’re driving though :( Can I interest you in some books"
while driving?. sounds dangerous,you kind of need someone else with you for roadtrips like that
but then whos gonna drive?,Can't be any more dangerous than watching movies while driving
what about playing a ps2?,Oh that's fine. Actually playing PS2 while driving is encouraged
Gta while driving?. AWEsome,"my SO basically has to have a movie on long drives because otherwise she can't pay much attention to the road lol Bro wont beat a single story mission with a screen that small hook a sim racing setup to your actual car. so you can drive recklessly in a game while driving recklessly irl lmao. have a beamNG map of the road your taking The hoes won't run over themselves if you tried to drive there in beam.ng and irl at the same time, i wonder how long it would take to desync and cause a crash time to find out. imagine making a sentient tesla FSD from Sydeny to Perth that might be the one way to *not* go crazy on that trip. tbh i really don’t understand how people can drive that far make the tesla go crazy instead. ask my dad i got no clue. (I cant drive) that’s tesla’s problem, not mine :3 until it tries to end its suffering by hitting a flock of emus idk all the people I know. enjoy driving. maybe its a cultural thing well there are different types of driving too like you can find driving fun and still hate long road trips the longest drive people do here is like 8 hours from across the entire country i’d love to spend 10 hours at a track day, but the same amount of time on a road trip wouldn’t be very fun. i know people who have driven that much in a day and called it a “short trip” :skull: correction. its like 6 hours. and like, you never actually drive all the way from the top down ah. tbh i’m surprised you could do a trip like that in 6 hours. i would’ve assumed it would take longer well that's none stop. and good traffic. with a stop to eat and normal traffic its more like 8 ah yeah, that’s closer to what i would’ve expected"
"Evening all, earlier I posted about my gps having interference from my vtx antenna. Before I pay someone to create a 3d print for me was wondering if I moved the gps to the arm here would that suffice?. That's like 7-9 inches away.",yeah it would. probably at least be good enough
Can I connect the flight controller with ArduPilot firmware to the betalfight configurator?,to try check to match the orientation of my motors to my current quad because it is flipping no that wont work. betaflights config tool only works with fc's that have betaflight installed on them. you can use the esc config tool to take a look at your motor directions if they are compatible Tekko32 F4 Metal 4in1 65A ESC (65A). which one is that blheli32... annoying. <https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli/releases>. make sure to set `SERVO_BLH_AUTO` to `1` in Ardu
"hi guys, im building my first plane with inav 7, and the cable for gps broke,  i disconnected gps module and set fail save to do nothing, but gps warning still there,  how do i disable gps system in inav 7 ?",I'll just drop this here for anyone having ESC issues https://esc-configurator.com/
"Did you untick ""use gps for navigation""?","nope, untick it already"
"hmm, no gps warn now,. then how do i disable fail save?","It's in a failsafe state because it's connected via usb. If its not connected to the configurator it wont be failsafed Also ""do nothing"" is like the worst failsafe don't use that. You use that if you want the aircraft to fly away when you lose signal"
is fail save can work without gps?,"No it can't. If you are running without GPS your failsafe should be set to ""drop"". So the aircraft instantly shuts off it's motor and drops if you lose signal"
What's on your modes tab?,"yes it is, my fail save mapping is reverse. thank you for be here with me:PepeCowboylove:"
are you flying with others?,Sometimes. The 1.2 is alone tho I had this issue recently and it was because the antenna on the goggles were broken on the inside. but ouside they looked fine
What kind of cable is it?,"You don't have a serial port selected at the top Yea, but it says nothing there. My tx is connected with usbc :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone: just a charging cable, but with my old drone I used this cable with the betaflight config. Also I play sim with this cable"
So I need usb c on 1 side and usb a on the second side?. It is c-c,"The radio may be missing the components necessary to passively report to the pc as a ""slave"" device on usb-c. With Usb A this is not necessary.. It's an annoyingly common issue I did it with the a-c. And. Nothing"
"Does the PC react in any way to the radio being connected?. Check if device manager refreshes. You may be missing some drivers, idk. I just now noticed this message lol.",It reacts. The windows sound lol You'll have to check device manager then.
A what?. Dang I need to learn English a bit,There is a program on your PC called Device Manager@Prints 4 You!. At least in English..
"while in full throttle there is some electric sound from fuselage, what could it possibly be?",Define electric sound a 4s with 40a esc. pzz pzz i try to make it again Okay I don't know what I expected from that one If I turn it on I hear a peep but on full throttle nothing
https://tenor.com/view/cat-huh-cat-huh-etr-gif-15332443943609734737. send pics of your motors. Could it be the plastic washers on the prop shaft rattling about?,nope. from battery:PepeHands: https://tenor.com/view/monka-cross-gif-4035178244594551512
do you have a capacitor on there somewhere?,The drone connects to the tx configurator:skull: but the tx not
are you plugging in the controller when it's on or when it's off?,try when it's off. some stuff works that way for firmware update Still the same problem
did you check for any problem devices in device manager?,"in start menu search (windows logo button on the bar), type this:  devmgmt.msc If you are trying to do a firmware update, in case you didn't try yet, you should try to unsolder everything from the fc, I never was able to update the firmware while I have used uarts, idk why, but it's been like that on all of my fc you're completely out of context xD. dealing with a crappy E8 radio Oh. Yeah I thought you were talking about an fc also, stuff on UART1-3 does this because FC's can be flashed through those see if there's anything with a yellow triangle on it with the radio connected. when powered off and powered on. I gtg now.."
"btw, your radio is the ExpressLRS version, right? :Harold:",send the screenshot from their website again  the one with the appp. so that vit has context
And now? Has the transmitter a chance or. Cz idk the version. And I can't connect it. No screen. You know,"this the batt. 4s 25c 14.8v. fully charged This actually sounds like a bad bearing to me im gonna try again. pray for me, i will put the motor on right batt on left, and my head in middle. if i didnt reply in 10 min, call ambulance. yup it is from battery"
Quick query regarding cable length. If you have to have a really long set of wires going from GPS to FC does that hinder performance due to length of cable?. I reckon it will be around 22-24 cm length of cable.,"That's a lot of wire. Make sure you twist them together to help with noise rejection. You might consider wrapping them in copper tape and grounding that to act as a shield as well. For what you're using it for I wouldn't Cheers, ye i always copper tape my gps cables and ground them. Will ensure this is done. :red_heart:"
Guys hei - how do I check which one does my drone have ??,"Less voltage sag, better durability, better flight performance, better flight time, even if for a mob7 a bt2.0/a30 connector would be better than both, cause you don't need the bulk of an xt30 on a 1s whoop. Also ph2.0 was designed to be a like motherboard plug, not to be used on a quad, and it sucks at being a battery connector"
Note i wanna make a poretable display. So I think XT60 would be big?. There is jst type connector on ev800d and its seems fine :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:,"An xt60 is ideal because size is less of an issue on a goggle battery, and you can pretty easily plug an xt30 the wrong way and dry everything, but it's basically impossible on an xt60 Do you think people have more commonly XT60 or xt30 or jst or other small connectors Depends on the usage, but a jst ph2.0 really is garbage"
Idk i got jst and will be ordering xt30 and 60 so ye it will be project turning ev800d into portable display so ye and i wanna power it by 18650x2. So I shoud rather put there XT60?,"I would say yes, also, an xt60 battery is also easier to charge since almost every 6s chargers use an xt60, so it's always one less adapter, and you won't be able to fry the electronics by plugging it the wrong way"
Who tf is plugging in XT30s the wrong way?. Literally never heard of that happening,"for exemple, there was a guy here who fried an x12 in the #help-with-drones, I'm going to look if I can find the post. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1242809158403625101 here"
What do you think? :D,"you should just get some 18650, the fatshark case, and an 18650 charger But shoud i do it you need to unplug the whole thing or rather just take batteries out and switch take the batteries out, charge them, put them back in Okey thanks for opinion :D cause you aren't going to charge some batteries with this case, since it will not be able to balance charge because there is only  2 wires Oh ye good point thanks Hmm. Without images as hard proof and several more instances, I would say this one report is not enough to justify changing my opinion to ""XT60 on everything"""
Does anyone know what connector the White one is?,"I didn't say xt60 on everything, but that on goggles batteries, where weight and space are secondary, an xt60 is a good idea (also idk how to fly said it was stupid easy to plug them wrong, so there's that too). But xt30 is still superior on stuff like micros where weight and space is important Wait so that means i dont even need XT60 on that because i can just connect it straight into goggles it wont be taken out Anyways"
"Fair enough. Honestly all of my goggle stuff is XT60->barrel plugs just so I can use my flight packs. So I think the real answer is itself a question: ""what battery do you want use?""","if it's for a case that will stay connected and where you swap the 18650, xt30 is fine (I will always love the xt60 more). well, that's my point"
I think i wasnt too specific on this topic what i want :D. Its ev800d board and i wanna make a display so the box will be on outside and i wanna connect it i was thinking about XT60 or 30 but i dont need it because it will be connected full time and you just switch batteries. The cable on the case will be cut. And also the battery will be removed. Do you know what i mean or?,"well, a dc barrel plug is just as good if not better than an xt60 in this case. so might as well keep it"
Hey @everyone Can you suggest any lightweight material for the arms and landing gear of the drones ?,"I'm not sure which I'm more amused by: the fact that you just pinged a random person, or the fact that you just attempted to ping almost *nine thousand* users to get an answer. Drones don't typically have ""landing gear"", they're built from carbon fiber which is plenty light and durable."
Can you show what you're trying to set in a screenshot?,"Also, just to get back on this, I just tried to plug in an xt30 the wrong way a dozen time because I had time to kill, and while it does take a little bit of force, it's not actually that much force sometimes (not sure if my alignment was different or something, but I had 2 times at the beginning where it was really easy to get a reverse polarity) so I could see a beginner just try to force it in, but granted I only managed to pass current through 4 times out of 10, so it's unlikely someone who has basic understanding of a connector will actually get a reverse polarity (but also I tried with some amass connectors, and the knockoffs are not always as stiff, at least the knockoff xt60 I have are less stiff than my amass xt60) Hi , I have an problem in Ports tab. When I'm trying to set in any uart for example gps after save and reboot it isn't still set, My betaflight version is 4.5, idk what I'm missing"
VTX and GPS on the same thing?,"That's not going to work :detective: Express Lrs is on Uart 2. I soldered GPS to TX1 , RX1 and VTX to VIN , VOUT , 5v , GND , ET, so Probably VTX and GPS is on the same uart 1, and i can't probably use uart 2 cuz I'll need to bridge reciver.  (this is my AIO): https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2023/02/07/happymodel-crazyf411-elrs-aio-4in1-flight-controller-built-in-uart-2-4g-elrs-and-20a-esc-for-toothpick/. idk what I'm doing wrong VIN and VOUT are just video signal. If you have a GPS On UART 1, then you will not be able to connect the VTX SA to TX1 for smart audio control. You cannot use more than one peripheral on a single UART.. On this page, set your VTX peripheral to disabled, leave the Sensor Input on GPS, then click save"
then where to set vtx?. @DædalusFPV,"You don't need to. With no Smart Audio control, the FC doesn't have any control over the VTX, and therefore doesn't need to know anything about it I think they're compatible. But you might want to ask in the Walksnail Discord idk why i can't set anything in transmitter tab I'm fairly certain they are though, the Moonlight is basically just a v2 VTX with a DVR board glued to it **Because you have no Smart Audio connection**. If I had any hair left I'd be tearing it out"
so it will still work in 400 mw ?,The VTX will operate at whatever you set it to *manually*
so how to set it mannualy?,"Ok, thanks. Than I just gonna try"
I assume there's buttons and LEDs on your VTX?,"I works, got an image and no smoke. Gonna try it with my new build, but first 60 seconds on the bench looks fine"
"Hey guys, I've trying lately to build a drone using a fpga card.. and it worked! now.. 2 of my motors should be reversed. how could change the direction through the code and not by soldering it different? thanks. using pwm, bheli ESCs",I don't think it's possible to reverse with PWM on the FC side. you'd need to configure the ESCs
"Betaflight uses dshot telem for reversing the esc, yeah?","it's DShot yeah. with some sort of programming interface, and a configuration tool like esc-configurator.com"
"are all the parts on vitroidfpv.com compatible with eachother? for the 5"" build?. excluding all dji video systems w/ analog parts i know they dont work","I don't know the guy, but from a quick look it all looks fine yeah I made it so that most if not all of the parts should be compatible it's hard to pick incompatible parts just check that your chosen frame has some mounting holes for the larger VTXs so i can just choose most mid-range parts from that list the different color designations just show price, doesn't necessarily mean the orange stuff is better than green"
I'm assuming thats a remote. I'm using this. https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/pocket-radio-controller-m2?variant=47236836327655,"You can opt for a cheaper receiver if you want, this one has a neat feature where it basically sends 2 signals at once. However to my knowledge that radio doesn't support it. Check the happymodel ep1"
Ye. I take it you know how to solder yes?,"No but my dad does lol That reciver is tiny. Like 10mmx10mm tiny Id would definitely recommend learning, it would help you greatly. It not hard just takes practice"
Do you think it would be okay though?. Yeah I’ve been wanting to,"Yeah it's a great receiver, i have it on my quad Generally RadioMaster receivers have bigger pads. also it is just kind of worth it to get your own soldering gear Ok, thank you for your time :) If you do, the cheapest worth will be a Pinecil (about 30-40 dollars) and some genuine leaded 63/37 solder"
Would this receiver be using one of the DSM protocols? I can't get it to bind to my TX16S  https://www.spektrumrc.com/product/srx210-fhss-2-channel-receiver-and-esc/SPMSRX210.html,"A radio doesn't need to ""support diversity""  RM pocket works fine with super d :Harold:. gemini and diversity are not the same <https://www.multi-module.org/basics/supported-protocols> Yeah ik, I'm trying to figure out which protocol the receiver uses. I tried DSM on Auto mode since it's a spektrum receiver but that didn't work FHSS i assume. no clue I also tried this one since it says FHSS but that didn't work either"
So this might be a bit of a dumb question but can you build an fpv drone with a gps unit so if it crashes you can see where it is?,"yes. but like how far away are you going. because on a freestyle drone it's pointless. just install a buzzer Well I was thinking more like return to home stuff, should have said that lol yes you can but not really on a freestyle drone Well because especially using analog, you're never going to unknowingly go outside of range. but on top of that if somehow ELRS fails which it never should, chances are you're BELOW something and going RTH would fly straight up into something Other reasons to crash. Motor or battery failure, video loss. Other random bs. Plus  I admit I have flown in situations where ELRS flaked but GPS was golden   Betaflight and iNav both have options to relay GPS loc back to your controller or RTH."
What controller / RC prototcol are you using ?,"You don't, it uses a set home position that it gets when first turned on You basically just need to yeet a gps on there"
Ok that sounds good. How much do you think a decent one is?,"Oh thats not bad at all Don’t expect magic from it. It’ll be finicky and sensitive. Not too accurate. And unless you upgrade to iNav or Ardupilot (loosing out on freestyle performance), the RTH is really basic. But IMO (others may disagree) it’s a nice insurance policy for $40 and you get GPS speed read outs :)"
That sounds nice. With a buzzer I think that would be good. I'm assuming a buzzer is on the drone so if it crashes it makes a noise so you can find it?,Yep and some have their own battery so even if you loose a LIPO it’ll buzz
What gps unit would you reccomend?,M10Q based ones are nice and small
"Yep. To one of the UART ports (TX-RX, RX-TX) usually. If your lucky (or match specs correctly) the connector on board will be the same type and you can do it solder free.   Usually each FC has a diagram as well giving an example including GPS.. https://www.getfpv.com/mateksys-m10q-5883-gnss-compass.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DM+-+NB+-+PMax+-+Shop+-+Under-index+-+SM+-+ALL+%7C+Full+Funnel&utm_content=pmax_x&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=&campaign_id=20800417087&network=x&device=m&gc_id=20800417087&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD8cN5KG_ig1Mjlo_uTPSxe-ltn5t",Make sure you have one powerful enough That has ALL the ports :D Get an F405 or above. Not an F722 or something I'm getting an F405 v4 Consider Skystars or Diatone or something
… why the dislike to speedy bee just curious ?,"They've had severe issues. ESC wise, and the v3 FC was useless Interesting. It’s been the first brand I’ve had stable good luck with. Work uses them a ton too. But more recent and more winged variants, non ESC. Noted… The wing boards are fantastic Diatone is solid tho. I haven’t killed my diatone stack in my Roma in 3 years.. Ahhh there it is then. I’ve been loving their wing boards"
Ok so should I not use the v4?,I'd get a similar priced Skystars or Diatone. Airbot even. maybe even iFlight
Something like this? https://www.diatone.us/products/mamba-f405mk2-v2-fc?variant=40145178591319&currency=USD&srsltid=AfmBOoqEhyis0EKQfYyazywe9jbER7v67JAQBq-A_TntjF5HDTvmN5dGqJ4. What type of severe issues?,Some ESCs just have had random failures
Their own website. I'm assuming thats what you mean. Wait a second that also says f405. Does it have the same issues?,"I meant for everything else. and no f405 is just the microcontroller on it. or ""CPU"" would be a good explanation for you I see. A ton of different ones gosh you should just. pick one or two. RDQ or Pyro should have everything you need"
I do have two except for the diatone stack. Also why is it better to just buy from one or two websites/sellers?,Shipping costs. Shipping times. And support services
Fair. Is there a difference between these two frames other than the addition of 3d printed parts? I don't see a difference but maybe theres something I just don't see. The 3d printed parts one is also 8 dollars cheaper which doesn't make sense to me.  https://www.racedayquads.com/products/rdq-source-one-v5-5-freestyle-frame-kit https://fpvcustom.com/products/tbs-source-one-v5-full-package?variant=43227301118115,source one v5 is the source one v5
Is 2200mah 35c 12v battery compatible with 30a esc?,"That's not how it works The ESC needs to take the voltage of the battery, and the battery needs to provide enough current to the motors I saw on a yt a guy said that if the esc is not strong enough it can explode"
That's what I'm asking. How to know if the esc can handle the battery?,"Look at what cell count it's rated for All ESCs will be rated to a certain voltage, as you change the series cell count of a LiPo battery, its voltage will change"
Do you know of any place I can buy one with a prebuilt controller?. with a receiver and transmitter,does anyone know what controller and receiver I can use for long-rage (at least 2 miles ) Get anything from RadioMaster with ExpressLRS. 2 miles isn't very long range
want to ask so if my battery has 2 separate GND wires it the charger will charge each cell individually ? and if i have connected those 2 wires into 1 ground wire it will charge it together or ?. i am not sure so i am asking :D. btw its on 18650 2 battery case,"So, we have a little something called a balance lead, with the ground and positive of each batteries on it, plus a power lead, and the charger charges the batteries via the power lead, and sucks back power through the balance lead so the cells don't get unbalanced, so, assuming your battery is 2s, you would need 2 positive and 3 gnd, with 1 positive and 1 ground for the discharge/power leads, and 1 positive and 2 gnd for the balance lead, like that"
ohhh understood in rm boxer is neeed those 3 wires or not ?. without the balance plug will something happend to battery or ?,"The boxer is powered using a balance connector. Since it also charges the batteries inside it needs the balance connector may i power it also with main plug (jst type) Yeah, cause if you try to charge the two batteries without a balance lead you can end up with one battery at like 4.0v and one at 4.4v (which is not good) since the charger will have no idea that one battery maybe fills up faster than the other"
ohhhh. so its nessesary to have balance plug. also on boxer. because it will know what battery is charged. and what is not. is that right ?. doesnt matter where i solder ground wire ?on the back. because the connedted. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) one question how can boxer charge 18650 but charger hota cannot??,"Both can, the hota just need an adapter"
Balancer to main plug adapter?,"Balance and main to balance combiner Is there a way around getting XT60 to make that I dont have XT60 and i wanna charge on charger is that somehow posibble If you only use a 2s battery you can just buy a toothstor. Amazing little charger, and it charges via the balance lead 18650 battery case. 2 batteries 18650 If it's 2s it can charge it. But only a 2s battery. (and since you need to select the cell chemistry in the charger you might not actually want to do it if you need a different charging curve for a li-ion compared to a Li-Po) Still dont undestand why boxer can charge with 3 wires only and hota needs additional main plug... because the hota's main method of charging is via the main port. it is a different design. the hota simply does not have a mode built-in to only charge using the balance port"
Is there a way around getting an XT60 connector to plug it in?,"It only uses the balance port to suck back in some of the power. Just solder on an xt60, it will be easier :dotted_line_face: I asked is there a way around getting an XT60 because i dont have it and you said solder XT60 i dont have :D Yeah. Cause the only way around it as far as I know is either to get an 18650 charger or to get a toothstor. But I don't know if the li-ion cells will be particularly happy to be charged like a lipo Okey so ig Best option is to charge on radio or get XT60 because i have no other options. Thanks for your help The xt60+balance lead would be ideal I got jst connector set and some wires so i just need xt60 Yeah, a pair of xt60 if you want to plug it in the monitor"
Help me please. 1300kv for 4s 5inch build drone good?,"not at all. and there's no point building a 4s 5"" anymore. I recommend you follow this to pick your parts. https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner I wanna build this on frame Mario 5. With this speedybee stuck. tell me this is compatible, I need it for freestyle not strong and for cinematics this page says everything you need to know. and also why to avoid that stack and why those motors won't work this page says why that stack is to be avoided"
https://www.defiancerc.com/products/foxeer-f405-v2-flight-controller-reaper-55a-esc-8s-stack im using this stack on bf 4.5.0 and i cant seem to use 8k pid or dshot600. i have the options for both but when i save and reboot it just defaults to 4k dshot300. any ideas?,Show how you're trying to save it
because you're not putting it in brass wire. are you using the pinecil yet?,Its on its way but the old soldering Iron the tip came. I got one from drone fpv racer
But its meant for soldering Iron. I dont think they will be selling fake stuff on big webside?? @Emilia (XT90 Janklet),That is weird. This one @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Get a golden looking one (actual brass) and it'll work loads better. yeah
Which vtx is better for using AKK race ranger or speedybee tx800?. On AliExpress. Just there,"No. Bad rosin can leave burn marks on the tip, but it can be cleaned off it kind of damages it but it's also fine. like it's fine"
Solder doesnt stick to it. It was brand new. Why is sponge bad?,"It's not, brass sponge is ideal. It's soft enough to clean the tip without damaging it substantially. Long looooong life on soldering tips used by hobbyists when cleaned with brass sponge"
Its normal when it leaves little bit of solder on the tip?. Or all tin shoud go away,Solder on the tip is fine. Burned rosin is not. In fact when you're done soldering you can leave a bit of solder on the tip to cool--that will prevent the tip from corroding
Does this look like rosin to you?. Ik i shoud be using rather flux in tube but rosin in this image is also fine or?,"that looks like burnt sugar. not rosin Looks like rosin paste, but not like any paste I've used"
Maybe is that the cause why my tip has burned? Or bad  solder cleanrr?,"This is for *welding* not soldering. Completely different use case There is soldering Iron image. :dotted_line_face::dotted_line_face: Yea, you can also find this image online too, doesn't make it less wrong"
Golden brass shoud be like soft and small?. Seems fine enough. :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:,"Brass is golden by color, the fake ones are made of copper-ish which is why it's red If you like the smell of fried chicken, I suppose"
Mine is like soft and small. Is that good?,I mean... brass isn't the hardest of metals I guess
"Any tips on how to reduce the motor's temp. here?. apparently changing the motor cooling condition from ""good"" to ""excellent"" fixed it, lol","I use the syringe tbs flux, and it's fine, I would expect the paste version to be similar"
How do I know if a gps unit or buzzer is compatible with my flight controller?,"anything that looks like it was made for fpv pretty much all the buzzers should work with anything will be compatible pretty much. Get something like a Vifly Finder, can't go wrong with it i got a hellgate but ive heard the viflies are better"
Ok thanks :D. Wait how does a buzzer know if a drone has crashed? Is it like a switch on the transmitter that you flick or something?,Either the flight controller tells it something is wrong. or it suddenly disconnects
Interesting. Sorry for all the questions but with a gps unit can you see the location on your phone or something? Like if it gets lost how do you know where it is?,Your DVR will tell you. and your transmitter will also store the info if configured properly you're young. owie ouch. digital video recorder footage that your goggles recorded
help! anyone i need quick help my Radiomaster boxer is not turning on for some reason. the tweening lights play but they just freeze and the screen never turns on no matter what. what do i do? im in quick haste and preasureeeee help,"Open it up, unplug everything and re plug everything. I Had the same issue, and that was the fix"
Does anyone know why my motors won't reverse? The motor is spinning the opposite direction what the camera fps makes it look like.,"so, funny enought I had the exact same issue as you with my whoops yesterday (running bf 4.5 on configurator 1.10.0) you should go on https://esc-configurator.com/ via chrome and it should be able to reverse the motor direction nope. oh well, guess im props out now you can pretty easily change the motor direction by just switching the position of two cables yeah but id have to do all 4. might aswell just stick with it well, it's not really a bad thing, props out gives better flight performance and rejects obstacles, so you're not loosing much"
"wdym by ""nope""?. just change the motor directions with the esc configurator","i did. they didnt change direction then you didn't change the directions You did something wrong. it works. Connect ESC configurator, Read Setup, change the directions, Write Setup. did. appreciate the help anyway"
"2 mobula  frames broken in the same spot. All I fly are low to ground circles under trees with all landings being on grass. Starting to think they are just trash. Any better 75mm frames? Does carbon ones with prop guards make sense or stick to plastics. Mind it its rear prop, I'd maybe understand if it was front one during crash but how does rear breaks","did not. I've yet to see that fail, ever. the BF Configurator thing fails all the time, the dedicated configurator (you have to pick the correct one for your ESC) never fails. the carbon frames like the fractal 75 (in case you want whoops) will still use some plastic whoops"
The battery on the mainboard?,"but if you fly outside exclusively, I would say get a carbon frame and try it out. it will be nearly indestructible, and it will give a different flight feel that you might prefer. the battery is connected on the main board yes I like how it looks, now just to find it in UK somewhere... also, if you want to try a more exotic frame, you could also look at the hachidorii v2 from cnc-drones, that being said I have no idea about the quality of the frame compared to the fractal"
how can you use more than 8 aux channels again?. i can't find anything online,"I have an issue, it fell in on itself when I was putting it on.  I can no longer unscrew it because it spins forever"
"So I think I've made a booboo not sure. Just made another 6s1p lion pack. However I forgot to finish the xt60 end. Plus it's to long. It's all wired up. If I cut it now and start to solder it, will it go boom boom?","just dont cut them both at once. its like its like alcohol and pregnancy, both are fine alone but together is bad So cut one. Solder it into xt60. Wrap that with tape to prevent touching whilst I do 2nd. How important is it to get my 107 if I’m doing real estate photos with a drone and a camera. I am making money btw"
And it’s about $130 right?,in my experience the actual testing is more prohibitive than the cost. Idr the exact dollar amount tho
Hey does anyone know for the get the latest elrs firmware onto the radiomaster boxer?. Im tryna set up my new 5 inch drone,https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/ Yea but it wont let me connect my boxer to the wifi
Then don't use the WiFi?. use the edgetxpassthrough. way simpler and faster,"Who did you use to study, looking for videos Just did it thx. Now gotta do the drone :loudly_crying_face: use betaflightpassthrough for that one I don't recall at this point, just that I gave up at some point because I realized the tedious hoops I was being made to jump through just weren't worth it for me. I only fly recreationally still.   Making money for flying is the dream tho- I'll probably get back to that eventually but I know I wouldn't have given up easily as well.. it was at least like a year or two ago when I was seriously looking into all that"
kk well ill have to do it tmr or smt coz I broke the balance lead and cant charge the battery. also im reccording these flights in angle mode but I usually fly in acro so does that matter?,"That is way excessive, set debug mode to gyro scaled and record another little flight. I'm leaning towards a mechanical issue with something like this Not really, unless you notice your setpoint in the logs jittering"
So I plan on flying a 2s toothpick drone and it suggests batteries from 450mAh to 650mAh. Should I get a higher capacity battery? Will it reduce agility?,"Higher capacity will be heavier, yea"
But it will also make it last slightly longer?. I think I will go with 450mAh batteries because they are like 2x cheaper and probably perform similarly lol,"Something loose such as the flight controller, a motor, or the antenna. Something coming into contact with the flight controller. Extremely damaged props"
well the 3d printined mount on my vtx antenna does have a little wobble. and as for things coming in contact with the fc it could be all the wires. can u tell if I send a photo?,It's 5 AM. Send it anyway someone might look. or use the forum feature. but i'm gone
"Need help. Tried to fly my drone. Once I turned it on, I saw smoke coming from one of the motors, and shortly afterwards the esc that is connected to it flared up. What could cause it?

Anyone that wants to watch will very likely see nothing but a blurry mess. *However*, if you insist on trying it, here's how I would do it: - EV800D composite cable to an HDMI output converter - Converted HDMI signal into an HDMI capture card  - HDMI Capture card plugged into a PC with Discord open streaming that video input hmmmm. god the stars are aligning. everything is telling me to upgrade to dji but i cant afford an o3 rn. wish i could"
what voltage you mean?. always charge up to 4.2v. no higher,"when you land it should be at around 3.2-3.3v, and when you land it should come back up to like 3.6-3.7. when it recovers back up, it should be no lower than 3.5"
so when i see IN AIR 3.2-3.3 i gotta land?,set your low battery warning in betflight to 3.35 yeah. mid flight 3.2-3.3. that should be low battery 3.1 should be land now and another question. I have the meteor 65 pro and when i connect it to betaflight its just not working ah im about to get one i litteraly just ordered the m65 pro 5 minutes ago are you using a proper data usb cable
i think?. i connected it to a 3.0 port,go into your windows search and type device manager wait. lemme connect it again. rq. okay im at the device manager. where do i need to go show me a screenshot of it. the window. click ports(com and lpt). go to betfaflight and click connect again. you might want to get this. https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads. go to impulserc driver fixer
it says searching for flight controller. should it take that long?,at most maybe like a min or two
ok. ima wait. ... how can i know if the cable can transfer data?,"yo actually im not entirely equipped for this, maybe someone whos a little more experienced can help you"
maybe its because of the cable?,"i have been doing this for about 2 months. yeah maybe its that bc the same thing happened when i was using a non data cable. to set up a buddies quad. maybe the com port was sum else yeah. thats why i asked This is true of *normal* lipos, but not of LIHV packs, which is what @ItsGal is using. yeah u right. i thought the betafpv werent lihv yeah that COM is somthing else i disconnected it from my pc and its still there. let me see if i have another cable. brb so nice those default packs that the m65 comes with are not terrible LIHV isn't on the wrapper, but nominal voltage of LIHV is 3.8, where noromal lipo is 3.7, and full charge is listed on the product page as 4.35V. They *are* shitty batteries though the square cells are obv better. ahhhh kk. yeah i am gonna use the default charger that comes with the quad. but i got the tattu folded cells. /square cells or whatv. i wonder if i will immideatly notice the difference between the two"
Why is your com port on manual selection?,i dont have another option. its only that
ummmmmmmm. no. should i. ?,"If you've tried a different cable, the ImpulseRC driver fix, and restarting Betaflight itself, then yea, I'd try a reboot. Drivers are weird sometimes, especially COM ports"
is there a store that sells ph 2.0 connectors in the US?. Like home depot?,No major chain of anything is going to sell that
hmmm.. is there a smaller store that sells them?,"If you're lucky enough to live in a city large enough to have one, you might find them at a local niche electronics shop or an RC shop, but that's about your only hope dual post :loudly_crying_face: Just delete the other one"
Is it bad idea to charge battery and then after that discharge in short interval?,then try the other suggestion. a different cable yeah. i need to buy one. ima go buy rn. brb
I charged battery from 3.8 to 3.9 for short testing shoud i discharge or leave it?. It was like for 2 minutes of testing,"Define ""short intervals"" I don’t stream my goggles. I steam from a separate capture device"
"Is using an adapted cable the only way to get the AM32 bootloader into the ESC? I mean, is there a way to do it via the FC's USB? I guess no, right?

rx to tx and tx to rx?,"Hi, new to the community. I have built a drone. Flashed the done elrs and rc. RC is showing a 'C' to confirm connection. But when I connect to betaflight it does not does not show anything in receiver when I move the controller. I have RadioMaster boxer controller and speedybee 55 405 fc Sorry dont know what that means :slightly_smiling_face: The way you wired your ELRS receiver to the drone. did you wire rx to tx and tx to rx I would have to double check that as the wires are hidden. I am quietly confident that I mapped it correctly"
What should that be set to?,"It should be set to the corresponding rx/tx that you soldered to on the flight controller Its serial via UART and CRSF at the moment. ok, I will check"
"Hm does anyone know where I should solder stuff? Live in an apartment right now, options are roof, courtyard, or some third place outside of the building",ventilated area because of fumes Just get a little fan and a carbon filter. as long as it sucks away the flux. Show a screenshot of the ports tab
i did whatever the instructions stated on speedybee. so that corresponds?,"i dont trust these things lol. i might just assemble them at my parents house or something (since im moving to a place with a patio soon) And i dont understand it enought yet to pick and choose :face_with_tongue:. RX went to T2 you should, they literally filter it out. if that didn't work I'd be like dead right now So it isn't on UART6, it's on UART2 then you should put serial rx on UART2 and not UART6 rx went to t2. ok, that makes sense. Thanks for the advise, appreciated"
Will putting biblades on my tinywhoop make it faster than tri blades?,at first thought about these.... :skull: Not exactly what i meant. But. Also cool. My question still stands though
Why would you do that?,Maybe. Depends on the pitch of the prop
So. Does the fastest pitch depend on the motors?,"Higher pitch = faster but also less flight time because it demands more torque to turn. And a bi blade with the same pitch as a triblade will be quite a bit slower But then why does my mobula not even take off with quad bladed props (a good rule of thumb on bigger quads is that if you remove a blade you add 1"" of pitch, but idk if it scales well with tinywhoops). Maybe it simply doesn't have enough torque to spin the blades fast enough to fly if it's the 2024 with it's 0702 motors, but maybe you just put the props on wrong. Or maybe you used a discharged battery and should I conformal coat it in case I decase it. I would decase it to get under 250g Tried multiple batteries, works fine with tri blade. It flies with quad blade but only for 5 seconds. So i guess i said that wrong. It does take off. But only take off Or you can just not decase it and be over 250g, or cut some weight elsewhere, cause a vtx is not made to be run decased yes but over 250g puts me in the same weight group as sub 30kg drones in my country lol Maybe it pulls too much current and the battery sags like crazy and it falls, I am going to need some more info here, like what mobula you use, what props you use, what batteries you use and how old are the batteries if you wanted sub250g you shouldn't have gone with DJI really. but decasing is probably plenty durable How about you become an evil criminal. Like all of us your camera shouldn't ever take a hit Instead of decasing an already fragile camera Mobula 6 hd with some new tattu 270 mah batteries, nowhere near the c rating that it says but that might not be correct"
Can you send of photo/link to the cells ?,"They’re the square ones not the round ass shitty stuff yes I thought about too, but I don’t really know how strict they are in my country (switzerland) Square cell and folded cell is the same thing"
https://www.conrad.nl/nl/p/lipo-accupack-3-7-v-270-mah-hardcase-molex-stekker-2324622.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping-feed&utm_content=free-google-shopping-clicks&utm_term=2324622&adcampaign=google&tid=17222081939_pla-2324622&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0_WyBhDMARIsAL1Vz8tW-PAlvne395IM0qbLLCuia4ebUvyl3gDBe2gSGkhzeMy0Kn5iY4saAryXEALw_wcB,"Just don't do anything stupid, fly in a remote place etc and you will be fine. Yeah that's some folded cells"
I kinda live inside a city so that’s easier said than done. do you have any experience with them?,"I would assume you have a car That’s a good thing right Cause flying in the city is a big nono. Yeah. Folded / square cells are the good ones But you would want to use tri/bi bladew. I personally have been really enjoying the 31mmx3 The stock tri blades are really slow though If you can find them I would encourage you grab some I might try them then yea. Is it normal that it’s literally impossible to do a powerloop because of the lack of power on 19000kv or is something else fucked Oh. Then i might get higher kv motors first Tinywhoops are just really underpowered. Yeah, and maybe the camera too I like recording in hd though Imo it's just some added weight, cause a tinywhoop already isn't super stable"
True. But if i get like 27000kv motors it should be able to at least do a powerloop right. Right?,"What I would personally do is to throw the hd camera and DVR board in the garbage, get a c03/fx17-b/nano 3 instead and save a lot of weight, and get a lighter canopy, swap the frame for one of the ultralight frames (such as the mob6 2024 frame, the meteor 65 air or the newbeedrone light af, even if I don't have any experience with the light af, even if it's the lightest 65mm frame you can get) and some 0702 23000/26000kv motors, even if they do limit the prop selection (you would want some ultra light props, like the 1209s or the 31mmx3/2) and not only will it fly a lot better, it will also have more power"
I do not have the budget to rebuild the entire thing rn. And does that camera also support hd recording?,"It's just the camera (about 20 bucks), canopy, frame and motors that you already wanted to change, and the canopy and frame are worth like less than 10 bucks together. No, the c03/fx17-b and nano 3 don't have any way to record in hd, you need a dedicated board for that Oh well then i might look into it But, from my point of view at least, performance in a tinywhoop is way more important How bad is it if i keep the camera. Because i REALLY want to record in hd. It’s so cool Well, it's heavy. Tinywhoops are not meant to be heavy. And if you keep it, you can't really go with some 0702, since it would be quite a bit of load on these tiny motors So just as a general something to know the power, will i be able to do a powerloop or catch myself even a little bit if i get the really light frame and 26000 kv motors. With the hd recording camera But if you decide to keep the chonky hd camera you will need to use some 0802 motors"
When i have the budget ill just build a new one for performance i guess and keep this one for tiny recording. Will that not make it worse because of even more weight?,"Look, otherwise you can tackle the problem the other way around, and take out the hd camera/boatd, put in a lighter camera, then later on make a 75mm whoop that will handle the hd board better That is a good idea now that you mention it Well yes but no, cause 0702 is really only suitable for ultra light whoops Ok. Gotta get some money firsy. First*. But i have gained knowledge now. Thanks. Damn a lot of stuff is not available here. Holy shit 4 props are €2,50. Damn. That is cheap af. €75 with shipping costs. Sometimes i hate the prices here, sometimes i love them. Right now i am hating them. Oh forgot the canopy. Haven’t found a good ond. One*. So. Let’s say i spend €90,- on this. Is that worth it"
Using an analog to digital (AV to HDMI) converter will add lag? Is it too much? :thinking_face:  Planning to hook a analog VRX into a HDMI monitor.,depends on the av to hdmi converter you get. I'd put a scan converter inbetween lol
for scan converters?. OSSC or retrotink,"Nice, going to check these. Thanks!"
this just happened to me now. any fix?>,hey looks its my reply
Which way do the T antennas on an elrs receiver need to point?. I was gonna have the 2 points point straight forward and back,with elrs it doesn't matter too much because elrs is Built Different. and also you ideally want your transmitter and reciever antennas to be parallel
"So really doesn't matter? Just mount em both as far apart a possible, for best diversity signal?",oh you have 2 antennas
"Or should I put them at 90s? One with the top part of the facing forward back, the other left and right?. Yes it's an rp4td",ideally put them perpendicular so each covers the other's null
"any 5"" freestyle bind-and-fly recommendations? either with no VTX or with Walksnail :S. better go to #shopping-advice , my bad",Just seen chris rosser video! Tinned copper braid rated for 63 amps. Tempted to undo all the packs and for peace of mind go with copper braid.
ELRS and Radiomaster ?,"Yes. I think I have the issue. Flashing was set to abuse not crsf, so trying that. Sbus*. Not abuse :p"
Recently picked up an rp3. How do I identify the ground and reciever side of the antenna?. Just trying to figure out the optimal way to mount them.,"Doesn't work like that, all you need to do is to mount them in a + configuration, both antennas receive and transmit I'm talking about the individual t's, one side is ground and one side is reciever.. I understand the diversity system Not really, it oscillates, there is not a ground or receiver side Which is why the 180° rotation doesn't matter"
Still benefits from being vertically mounted?,It benefits from being in the same orientation as the tx antenna Mount them 90 degrees to each other for best coverage Which is why having them in a + configuration is optimal. So you always have one that is kinda in the same orientation. Also it makes the coverage more uniform
My TX is currently running a moxon. A+ meaning?,"Doesn't matter if it's a moxon or an omni dipole You've got my brain very engaged, there is little to nothing about this on surface google lol. Antenna one and two at 90° from each other Oh so literally forming an x https://oscarliang.com/antenna-positioning/ Already read it a couple times. Also, you can just look at the wave form and how the antenna function and that's about how you figure it out Me learning.. I'm trying to squeeze more out of my vtx too Well, just use some good antennas. That aren't being obstructed by the battery. And that aren't a stubby either. Those have terrible range for freestyle I've got a 1.6w blitz and can't decide to buy a mmcx that connects directly to the vtx. Or keep using the sma adapter. Also the sma adapter touches the frame the way its mounted Keep the sma pigtail. Well then if you short the frame to positive you will burn the electronics. You would want a tpu mount for the sma"
"It also touches the reciever antenna that I've tucked away. Quite the mess right now, I'll sort things over time. But my question being, does the contact between the pigtail and frame matter? In terms of signal","It probably does a little, but it's a tx Omni, it doesn't matter that much No the pigtail should be shielded with a thin silicone/ plastic Layer."
i cant turn on turtle mode. what to do?. And Yeah Its On Dshot. Dshot300 and its still not working,"you need to set the aux channel. it's called ""flip over after crash"" and can be found in modes tab"
uhhh... a free one?. probably not a momentary switch,"wdym. what is a momentary switch a button that goes back if you release it. only turns on momnetarily. pretty self explanatory there so if you're not a psycho, you'd put it on a toggle switch. toggle on, arm the quad, and ONLY us the roll or pitch"
then what's the problem?,but after aux 3 its just not working
what's aux 3 on your radio?,ummmmmmmm. wait. lemme check. how can i ckeck
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAotpevszs&t=47s. dont sound like you know how it works. watch this video. if you've watched it before, watch it again",sry abt all of those questions im a begginer. k that's ok.. bump https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1247510175921737789
I'm not sure I fully understand your question. What are you actually trying to do?. You're most likely going to have to open up the goggles to see why the SMA connector is not staying in place. Possibly an internal nut came loose or a plastic bit broke that needs glued back down,"Haven’t touched mine yet, but https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1246893163373793441"
yeah i took it apart and the sma came off. it looks to have been soldered on. can i just like solder it back? is it hard?,im in an online class rn. in like an hour and a half its over il take the goggles apart again. and send pics
Are you using Betaflight's pre-arm mode? Are you using DSHOT beacon?,"Im about to so the same here, hopefully superglue with suffice"
im using prearm and i've heard about turning off rx_set. but im yet to fly now that i've turned it off. are those two the only ones holding it back?. i know this is a preamptive question but just want to see if that's all it takes,"If you're racing, just turn off beacon and pre-arm"
"Now, I do not own the kit to solder, would a tiny dab of glue work?","No. They must be soldered Also a terrible design if you think about it, like you directly interact with these and they could have snapped at any time …. Shit Yes it is terrible. But cheap."
"Ireland. Im about to rewire this, is it safe with this chip in it?","Just get a new jst plug. But if you are referring to the tiny little dent on the wire, well, it's fine"
Is it bad to keep batteries in storage mode for like a week or so without using it?,"No, that's what storage charging is for Good as new … hopefully You just need to plug it in the charger, and all the cells should read about the same voltage. If you have a cell at like 5v, then you screwed up. Sometimes batteries are left years and don't degrade too much because they were at storage charge A couple caveats that I would add to that: - The batteries need to be kept cool at storage voltage in order to minimize long-term internal cell damage (this is an inherent effect to all lithium batteries and cannot be avoided). Ideal long-term storage temp seems to be about 40-45F, but anything below 65F shows a noticeable increase in shelf-life. - The lipos need to be checked periodically and re-charged to storage voltage in order to keep them long term. I check my long-term batteries about every 3 months Cool thanks, just plugged it in there and its fine :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
are they the kind with the plastic thing inside ?,There not locknuts no then you should use loctite
aren't those the ones you were talking about ?,"No i was talking about the Golden nuts, they go on the stacks screws and Lock em to the frame oh ok. if the top nuts aren't self locking, you should use loctite. the blue one, the red one is permanent"
A quarter inch socket should work for m3 nuts yah?,"well, I don't use freedom units unfortunatly, but I use some 5.5mm wrench for my m3 nuts"
"i havent flown in months and i forgot a lot of the knowledge i need. i want to get flying before my vacation, where do i even start?","you buy a simulator and you train. there is no other magic formula i have a sim, i mean for of like hardware and software. i cant remember if i quit just for cost or because something broke well, you will need betaflight if you fly betaflight. if you are a kiss heretic then idk. (and for inav, you need inav configurator, same if you fly ardu I guess, I don't have experience with ardu) im betaflight, i have a adapter to use betaflight in the field too well, go download bf configurator 1.10.0"
i guess i should watch some videos for setting it up?,yeah. J.B as a good tutorial for betaflight
oh ok. Hey @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) does this look ok?. Just plugged it in for the first time in months. And I forgot how much to charge them,"poor thing, that cell at 2.7v is not a good sign. well, also having all the cells at 3.5 isn't great either I’m thinking it was showing signs of damage back when I was flying as well. It was at storage I believe"
Does the distance between the propellers have to be absolutely symmetrical? Like same exact distance between each propeller? A perfect square? Because I found in my drone some slight asymmetry.,"-""discharge voltage 3.3v""  that's stupid, you land at 3.5, otherwise you damage the battery"
hey guys my mobula6 is going crazy when i charge the batteries over 3.8V. any fixes?,"no, but having it symmetrical in at least one axis is essential for good performance, but you don't need to have the quad be symmetrical in X and Y axis, cause dead cat exist, and it doesn't need to be a perfect square, which is why we have quite a few non square layout (like stretched X, squashed X, dead cat, H and probably some others) basically, it's  fine if it isn't a perfect square"
"What do you mean by ""one axis""?. Like same width or same length?","like that, the blue is one axis, the red another, the circles represent the props, and in this case it's symmetrical in the two axis. and there it is symetrical with one axis Yeah... length (y) and width (x)"
if the spacing between the two front props is smaller than the spacing between the two rear props ?,"Because even in your second pic they form a perfect square @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) I unplugged the balance lead and put it back in, now it says 3.3 for the 1st cell nah they form a rectangle"
Maybe my lead is damaged?,"but anyway, it shouldn't be a big issue. not ideal, but it's fine. good question. I would say it's unlikely the balance lead is damaged. cause if it was damaged it just won't report the cell My charger said there was an error with the lead so I replugged it and it worked maybe the charger bugged for a second"
Is this good?. I’ve messed with the settings and still nothing works,Now I’m trying to discharge the 6s I was charging but I keep getting an error “abnormal battery connection “. i dont want it to be left at 4v but idk how to get it to discharge Please send a pic that shows both of the battery connections to the charger and the screen of the charger
Does it matter where elrs receiver is mounted a slong as the antennas are clear of everything?,"pretty much. just keep the antenna away from any carbon or metal uhh. does it do that with all lipos you have this used to happen every once in a while, i can try my other one and take the peel off the charger i only am getting the error when i do the storage setting what if you discharge. and then stop at 3.8"
"Does the cc,camera control wire have to be connected?. Or is that only to change camera settings through osd",camera settings. but just wire it up to a spare uart thats exactly what the storage setting does
So just wire it to cc pad on the speedybee f7v3?,discharge setting is giving the same error fly it to 3.8. on a more serious note sounds like your charger is malfunctioning
What was on it before you flashed?,"the other way around. as I was rolling the wheel right way, the bar in the screen goes down used to go down like normal. but now it goes up.. I'm asking everybody to fix it atm."
"That's not what I meant. What firmware did you have installed?. Also, what does this mean?","i'm just saying it seems that nobody know how to fix the way to do it backward of thr wheel. You still haven't answered my main question. oh sorry. EdgeTX ""Centurion"" v2.10.1 to my Radiomaster Pocket"
What firmware was on it ***before*** that???. Ffs,And my charger has been sitting on a shelf so idk how it would be ruined
"This isn't how home electricity works. Eh, ISDT quality. Do either of the plugs in the charger feel... Idk, loose?",It all feels nice and tight
Does the charger still show that error if you try a different charge mode? Like discharge instead of storage?,Only doesn’t show on charge. I haven’t tried the destroy setting yet but I don’t want to destroy the batteries. But on storage and discharge I get the error. And this is the only battery I have that all 6 cells are reading so I don’t have another one to test with
Do you have any other way to discharge this pack?,I guess I could plug it in the my quad and let it sit but I don’t want my hardware to overheat. I’m wandering if it’s the battery that is causing the error
RM factory. I just have to downgrade? or factory reset?,"This would be what I would do. Grab a fan if you're worried about the heat, or, if you can, just, take it outside and hover LOS for a few minutes until it's at 3.7V/cell My transmitter battery is done for so I can’t do a hover. It’s puffy, squishy, and won’t charge"
"hey, is it alright to charge my tx16s via usb with two 18650 batteries in it?","And can I charge these batteries with this plugged into my laptop and does this mean its fully charged 3.8 is storage voltage. Not fully charged.. 4.35v, 0.2A just found this, can i just use my computer charger (its got a plug that fits laptop chargers) and put the batteries in Should be able to but don't ever leave it unattended"
yeah ok. do i have to plug them all in or just a couple it ok?,"how come the battery says hv 3.8 then https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/ im getting ""Abnormal Battery Connection"" error on the storage and discharge settings. and only have 1 battery that seems to still be alive ISDT is known to do that"
is it right that it should take about an hour to charge?,"Yes, 1c should take about 1 hour from empty to full"
is 4.32 v enough charge?,Lipos should be charged to 4.2v per cell this is a hv. so supposedly its 4.35
"hey there, does anyone knows what C rating would be good to charge some 21700 cellls ? (some samsung irn21700 50s)",well can he not just solder connectors instead of the actual o3. that way its just unplug and unscrew
"I have a cable, usb c to T60... doesnt seem to work. I have a DJI powerpack with my DJI FPV drone, has a usb port on it?",Any recommendations on chargers. I got a ISDT Q6 Smart charger thinking its a charger I just plug in. But appears to be more something you charge from a batter than the mains. Yeah you need an external power supply for these cheaper chargers
"hey there, I wanted to know if anyone knows if CC is the same thing as VCC ? since on the skystar f405 aio I can't find a vcc port, and this is the closest I found","ok, well it's weird it doesn't have any vcc pad well, the big + one is there :KEKw:. there is BAT in the DJI connector as well I love how 5V becomes 10V and then goes back to 5V Yea the attention to detail on this diagram is really impressing me yeah, like the anglog vtx not sure if sarcasm or not looking close enough :face_with_tears_of_joy:. it's impressively cursed xD Definitely being sarcastic lol. It's horrible"
What fc is this?. Yes i’ve tried google lens,send pic of other side All i know is that it’s a flywoo. That’s the other side. ^
Flywoo Goku F411 16x16?,"some particularly cursed version of it.. Idk. It says flywoo. Doesn’t look like this one nah flywoo sometimes does some cursed crap. one-offs for specific builds Might be old. Here’s the esc https://www.myfpvstore.com/fpv-electronics/flywoo-goku-f411-16x16-micro-flight-controller/ it is definitely a revision of this Don’t worry abt the soldering. That looks like it this stack:  https://www.myfpvstore.com/fpv-electronics/flywoo-goku-f411-v2-2-1616-stack-fc13a-escvtx-mpu6000/ That is literally what I said When i googled the pics looked different So i guess you were right The v2.1 board is what seems to come up in search more than v2.2 the way the FC and ESC are connected, with the vertical pins THIS ALWAYS BREAKS Uhm. So basically. I should get a different one later crash it hard enough or often enough and one side will rip off of the pcb Just plan for it now, so you aren't surprised and disappointed later Just mentioning it because I've seen it far too many times It doesn't happen as much when the FC and ESC are hardmounted together. and softmounted as a whole They are. Softmounted yeah but individually. so the boards move individually which flexes those pins I could just glue the rubber together that's not the issue. the rubber is the issue, but it's its application"
Can i just put a zip tie around them?. Oh,"with this stack connector, you want the FC and ESC to be rigidly connected together. and then this 2 board unit to be softmounted externally. right now the FC and ESC are separately softmounted to the stack screws Well how tf do i do that It's not made to do it. that's the issue. It's a case of idiot design Why did they do it this way. Man. Flywoo Ease of assembly without regard for longevity because it doesn't matter to them once it's sold and has survived a dozen flights Huh. Damn. So like basically every other big company well, people want cheap drones. so they get cheap engineering and cheap manufacturing. and cheap QC (often no QC) Basically fly it if it breaks, it seems that there are edge pads which can replace the functionality of the stack pins. so you can solder it together What if i solder it now already Don't fix what ain't broken yet So i have backup. Oh ok you risk breaking it before you got anything to fix That is a good point. This build is gonna be crazy. Im building it with leftover parts those tend to be the most fun The vtx antenna im gonna use is about as big as the entire drone ohhh... okay don't do that. there's this fun thing about unbalanced drones. they always go for the face Well it’s not that bad Oh dear. those motor wire extensions are a bit thin That wasn’t me. Other guy did that before me also that is probably the worst place where to splice the wires. aaaanyway Not planning on this being my main thing though. So. Ye as for the antenna, just bunch up the cable and make it not wobbly. wobbliness = problems I’m gonna do it like this. Battery might be a little big. But who cares. This is probably going to fly for like 3 seconds huh Double PH2.0 connector is cursed. Of course its Emax. Let me guess, these batteries are from a Tinyhawk"
Yes. They are. I did not know the annoyingness when i bought them. Gonna be xt30 later don’t worry. So. Another question. Hypothetically. Could i just not have a capacitor on here. Or will i burn something. Because i only have a big ass 6s capacitor laying around rn. Should i just fly without a cap?,What are the cheapest brands that are actually good for 6s batteries. I know quality comes with price but what are cheap ones that are pretty reliable
"Those motors are HUGE for a 5"" prop, and far too slow unless you're running at like... idk, 10S. What are you hoping to build?","They use a standard nut size, if you can figure out what that is you can extrapolate from that. If i was home I would measure one for you It's almost like.... it's a standard spec... maybe there's a spec sheet on the internet... Not a 5"" drone, not with those motors. Really not any multi-rotor.. They don't even have a threaded prop shaft--those motors are designed for slow-flight airplanes with the prop attached *literally* with a rubber band.. You can't build a quadcopter with motors that do not have the propeller fixed securely and rigidly Oh... well I'm currently only in a test stage. Just trying to get it off the ground for a few seconds. Ok well you really need to stick to the recommended specs for those motors then. 3S voltage, 9-10"" props. Don't expect to do anything fancy."
Lol yeah. It's a type of fish.. Just kidding. But did you mean 11v?,"Yes, a 3S lithium polymer battery, which operates between 10.5V and 12.6V, as specified on the spec sheet for your motor I wanted to try it on a smaller drone with 5inch props, but I guess not."
Which does your drone support?,"i'll google it :peepohappy: it's dji mini 2 se I'm getting deja vu here. The Mini 2 SE doesn't appear to support NTFS, only FAT32 or exFAT"
Controller is connected to the DJI O3 air unit. But isn't in betalflight. What does that mean?,No bars on the left implies something else is not configured correctly
What other steps are required to connect a DJI Air Unit in Betaflight Configurator? I'm sure there's a guide or something..... Hmm,"Yes I did that. Everything should be ok. But it isn't :slightly_smiling_face: If everything is configured correctly in ports and setup tabs, and you are using the latest configurator version, and it still does this I would reflash betaflight to the quad I found it. Very stupid.... I flashed ELRS to the quad but it needed to be SBUS ofcourse :slightly_smiling_face:"
Anyone know how to get the Pavo 20 into WiFi mode to update the ELRS ? I’m having a  hard time trying to do it through  the configurator,"The receiver itself needs to be put in wifi mode, and you don't do it through the configurator. If you already have it bound to your radio, you need to use the Lua script on your radio to put it into wifi mode. I'm assuming you don't though, in which case you should check out the ELRS documentation page that covers this.  https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/webui/#receivers https://www.expresslrs.org/software/updating/wifi-updating/ Thanks I’ll check that out"
How do I flash a non spi elrs receiver?,Scroll up just a tiny little bit Literally to the conversation I *just* had before your question
Antennas on your goggles?. VTX in pit mode?,"rule of thumb i use is just do the cell # times 4. thatll be pretty much at the middle of your batteries power I believe that my U.fl connector on my FC is broken as my video feed is awful and cuts out about 1 meter away, I've checked the continuity on it and the ground and live element seem to be connected. Does anyone know if this means it is broken and if so is there an easy way to remove a broken U.FL as I'm really stuggling and I don't want to damage this board. Show pictures of everything, antennas plugged in and goggles okie 1 sec. It works at point blank range That doesn't look plugged in properly Its as far as it'll go in. Even at this range it drops out"
Are you on the same channel?. VTX and goggles,"I've checked my VTX, got the right VTX table, not in pitmode, not on low power thingy The goggles are on the same channel, However the channels seem to be all over the place. I think the live is bleeding into the ground and ruining the signal under the UFL. I have tried changing out tthe antennas on both the drone and the goggles, none of the antennas seem damaged, they work perfectly fine on my other drone"
still new to drones. what are those?\. but yes to elrs,what controller and what drone lite radio 3 and meteor75. @Sea_Kerman I assume ELRS. Is it spi or uart
The board in the meteor has a uart rx(serial) so you update it separately. What controller do you have?,lite radio 3 (not pro)
Update. Can you put your controller in internet mode?. I don't know if betafpv radios can do that,this one can but its been fidgety. i havent been able to get it again internet mode/ wifi mode. i can connect thru usb tho ah. That is a little inconvenient but usb should work
**is it fine to have 18 awg battery cable with 14 awg drone cable?** - Stack is 40A - motors 20A each 80A,is betaflight different from elrs config. also betafpv has their own config. there's too much programs that idk which one to use
do i need to update both controller and drone?,"But for the difference 18 awg is rated for 31 cont nad 12 if 100 cont so I would say no. You don't need to update them, only put in your binding phrase. Unless they are different versions like 2.x.x and 3.x.x but if they are both 3.x.x you are good The literadio doesn’t have a screen so interacting with the ELRS module is hard Yeah, It is not ideal yeah i wouldnt know how to bind without screen >__> im new to drones haha. im just now learning this stuff Not wrong wire just wrong size. You should probably use 12 gauge but i have the batteries. they are 18 AWG well drone has 14 awg I know the wait is annoying but returning the beta lite and getting the radio master pocket would be a huge upgrage for the same price Yeah I hear the literadio gimbals drift horribly"
Have you had any problems? what batteries?,"i am building my 2.5incch drone. someone mention the cable for batteries might be to high of AWG. but i was told they was right A 2.5in drone will almost certainly not be pulling 20a per motor, the cables are fine so i am confused. its 4s drone T-Motor 1404 4600KV 3-4S Brushless Motor 1.5mm. TATTU R-LINE 550MAH 95C 4S1P LIPO BATTERY PACK WITH XT30 PLUG SpeedyBee F405 Mini BLS 35A 20x20 Stack You weren't clear about the size but if you draw more than what 18 gauge can handle somethings not right okay i was freaking out a bit. i was thinking i got the wrong batteries Yeah Tattu won’t put a wire too small for the battery on a battery well thanks for making sure i wasn't wrong If you were pulling enough to make the wire gauge an issue you would have already lit the battery on fire i havn't build 2.5inch drone yet"
The holes on my motors do not fit the holes on my drone... how can I adjust it?,https://tenor.com/view/file-filing-paper-work-gif-22992632
"What is the motor mounting on the frame and on the motors ?  Because you can mount some 12x12 on a 16x16 mount, I think you can mount a 16x16 on a 19x19, and you can also mount a motor with 3 9mm hole on a quad with 4 9mm holes and vise versa. Drilling holes in your frame is a pretty bad idea since it will compromise durability and will throw some toxic carbon powder in your lungs",Thats not a drill. File Both will still actively try to murder you with toxic carbon fiber dust Hello guys! I am looking for a quad fpv pilot in Berlin who can help me with testing my project drone. I can pay for this service and ask for it later again. If you are interested and can controll 5 and 10 inch drones contact me pls. Thank you You could also go #meet-ups
Hi all. Can I build a pusher by simply flipping my quad frame and props?,"Yeah, but imo, there isn't a big advantage to a pusher, it just gives a little bit more stability, but it also exposes the motors more to damage"
"I see, I read they can improve flight time slightly? Is this baseless?","It could, cause the column of Thrust doesn't have obstacles (the arms) so you would get a little bit better efficiency, also I guess it would make for a little less vibrations so the pid tune would work a teeny tiny bit less, so it maybe will give you a few percent more flight time, idk the exact number, but it would probably be negligible. If you want more flight time, just fly less aggressively. You can probably squeeze out like 8min of flight time off most quads if you just fly slowly without doing any acro"
What is the motor and frame ?,"Does anyone know the best way to remove a U.fl connector from my FC, I think mine is broken They are not aligned. But u have an idea. Don't remember. But the holes are  simply not aligned. It's not their size, it's the way they are positioned."
"Okay thank you, I'm stuggling to desolder it though, because its soldered on all 4 sides, any tips?","It's a simple problem. Both parts have 4 holes in a form of rectangular, but they are a little bit different. So when you put two parts together, the holes mismatch. If you want to know what I would do, I would just get a big plier and heat the whole ufl with a 400°c iron and tear it off (very bad idea, it could rip off the traces and the vtx is now dead)  now, what you should do is to get a heat gun and remove the ufl with some pliers after you melted the solder Okay thank you very much It's a simple problem but saying one is different than the other doesn't tell me if you are trying to screw a 19x19 motor on a 12x12 frame, or a 16x16 frame, or a 9mm motor on a 12x12 frame etc, what you could do is to see if you can mount the motor in diagonal. Like that Perhaps I could screw two holes out of four.. I don't know what all those numbers mean. 12x12, 16x16, etc.. I'm metric person 16 is in millimeters. So is 12x12, 9x9, 19x19"
It means for exemple 16 milliliter from one screw hole to the next. And the frame is ?,"12x12. And the frame holes are slightly tilted You might be able to mount the motor still by only screwing 2 holes. But you will need to drill out a bit of carbon between the two mounting hole so the shaft screw doesn't get stuck. Use a mask when doing this, carbon fiber dust is nasty I think I'll try to make an adapter"
"If they can handle 2s voltage then itll be fine, what goggles?",It's highly likely to be the Uart version.
I assue via the dc barrel jack?,Easy way to check is connect it to Betaflight.
Are they fine if its not regulated? Voltage,"Nah, printing an adapter will just introduce a lot of vibrations Lipo bats arnt regulated. Your goggles can handle 6.5v to 25.6v The escs are rated for 20A iirc. The 1.5A is probably the voltage regulator's rating"
"You think? I though about a piece of thick plastic with 4 holes on each side, one side for motor and the other for the frame.","i'm sure. tho you could probably cnc an adapter out of carbon fiber, tho it will reduce the durability"
Even if it will be screwed tight?,"plastic is not as stiff as carbon fiber OK. Let's say carbon fiber. Yeah because I'm thinking about using the 5v pads for my runcam thumb pro, that should be enough imo. It seems a lot of people do that don't, get a discrete 5v BEC instead, it will be cheaper than maybe burning the regulator inside the fc and ending up with a dead aio"
where would I plug it on the FC ?,"the 5v bec will be powered from the battery, then to the camera, so you are sure you won't fry the 5v regulator since you will bypass it"
"yeah but how do I get it to interface with the battery ?. I guess there is a battery pad on the FC. seems like a lot of people just plug their cameras on their 5V, I couldn't find anyone having a problem with that. Are you sure it's not being over protective ?","or a vcc pad. almost all my fc issues are because the 5v regulator went kaboom, and it usually took the rest of the board with it, even if I didn't put too much load on it (and the regulators were rated for way more than what I was pulling) so it's just being protective, cause burning a 5v regulator is  easily avoidable, by using a separate BEC I see, but if I use a BEC I also need to wire it to my FC for camera control through the controller no. you just solder the two in to the battery connections, and the two out to the runcam cable, and the rest of the wires just go to the fc like normal"
is there a BEC you can recommend ? seems like there are a lot of variations,"I use these two  https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/bec12s-pro-9-55v-to-5812v-5a-matek-10500.html and https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/matek-micro-bec-630v-5v9v-6646.html and so far, both still work well"
"thanks, did you glue/ziptie them to your frame or are they dangling ?","I heatshrinked them, than double sided tape them on the frame. you don't want them dangling, they will short on something if you do"
Just went through my bits.... found that I got 3 of these. How do you actually wire this up?,You wire positive to positive and negative to negative
What is your intention with these?. Why did you buy them?,"I am building a 6s cinewhoop 3.5"". Alot of the aio I'm looking at have 5v 2a becs at best, thought that's on the light side if I'm running a dji o3.. So thought I'd add a bec to support the air unit. Then yes, you wire from battery pads or a vbat pad to the in side, and you wire the out side to your vtx. Solder bridge the top right if you want 12v, leave it unbridged if you want 5v Thank you sir!!. Just to confirm, Yeah, just dont get ground and positive mixed up"
"What are you trying to power, exactly?",Idk what the voltage requirements are for an O3. If 5v is enough then use 5v 7.4 to 26.4 volts. so you need 12v
should I mount it like in picture 1 or 2? I feel like the esc is a bit close to the pressnuts in 2 with only 1 spacer,"yo. i got my m65 pro in. the flashing target that everyone uses. i dont have it. when i tried to use the aio betafpv target it didnt work, had the wrong one"
Have you checked to see if the top plate  will fit if you 4 rubber rings on the stack screws?,Might as well use two spacers then
Ye that is what i am asking. I dont want to over charge the 4.4. Anyone any ideas? (i dont curently have 1 cell liion charger),"18650 cells are 4.2v max. The rm boxer can charge them Will it balance them though, that's the real question try it and see, check every 5 minutes I guess. would be dumb if they didn't balance"
What will it do if it will go up the voltage?. Maybe to 4.6 or 5,"stop it before then lol. id say 4.25 at most. theoretically (based on how most balance chargers work) it should charge until one cell hits 4.2, then that cell will stay there while the other cell also charges to 4.2 Its crazy that i will say but its 4.4 alredy what they typically do is discharge the high cell through a resistor. stop it. (unplug usb) I didnt charge yet. It was 4.4 Battery seems fine its orange as the flames on her theoretically plugging it in should make it *dis*charge that cell.... whats the othger cell at Depends. I ll go risk it 50/50"
It will either discharge or charge. I ll give it like 5 minutes?,I ll hope. 4.41 to 4.48. :smiling_face_with_tear:. Balancing: The RadioMaster Boxer does not have an internal battery balancing circuit. Balancing different voltage cells externally before using them together is essential to avoid potential damage or safety hazards. Okey what do i do now. :smiling_face_with_tear:
Hello guys. What's up with these closed ESCs?. Stuff like this. Are they safe to use?,if going up in flames is what you call safe to use :PepePyro: :chefkiss:
"""drone""?. You're trying to find single escs for a small copter or something else?","I am from Aus. I don’t really have a budget, but I want to get the cheapest decent one. This is my first drone so not looking to go over the top"
15x15 cm. Is it easier to make a single copter or a quad?,"what's that in american prop size 5.91”. Oh not prop size, frame size"
What's the prop size?,I haven’t bought anything yet We haven't used single escs for mini quads in at least 6-7 years I’m still in the planning phase. I meant like 4 escs
But I can use single escs for all 4 motors?,"https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner. refer to this to build a modern quadcopter I’m only worried about the stack. I found everything else, but ESC and FC aren’t cheap. I have to spend on a soldering iron, solder as well"
How much amps do you think it can withstand?,"Most likely, a goggle doesn't consume much I mean for discharging liion. On hota d6 pro. I ll be getting today some XT60 connectors Oh, well idk at how many amps the hota d6 discharges a 1s battery I wouldn't pass more than 1A continuously in those tiny cables"
0.3 amps as lipo shoud be fine?. I mean like lipos are discharging on max 0.3. 1 cell,What's up doggy. How's your flying
What is different between 2 and 3 blade props? Which should I be using?,"The number of blades. But outside of that, bi blades is (usually) more efficient, since you have less leading edge so less blades you need to push through the air, and they (usually) have less thrust (but you can just use higher pitch props and it behave close to a tri blade), and triblades (usually) have more thrust, can corner better because they have more grip on the air because of the higher surface area, and bi blades will be noisier because it will have only 2 vortices instead of 3 on a tri blade (and a quad blade is also quieter than a tri blade etc) and all the advantages/disadvantage of triblades is also true for higher blade count when compared to a lower blade count prop Interesting. Thanks :D"
Any tips on how to cut this copper braid? Messy as he'll.... even used snippers.,"3.5"". Using SpeedyBee mini No, you'll want something where in the range of 3000 to 4000kv"
is that braided glass?,Braided copper for making batteries ah ok nvm then. pizza cutters works well with composite fabrics. not sure if that's still the case with copper tho
is this getting soldered on the end?,"ye it is. but its frailing like a mofo. I guess I could tin the end. before cutting that is the idea I wanted to propose :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. had to contact the seller. He says the only way to cut them is with Shears. Not sure how Chris rosser was cutting them with regular scissors in his video. They must be special rosser scissors You'd be surprised how much scissors vary in material and shape ye true :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Ill tin the end and the line i am going to cut. effort but will be worth it in the end. The tin strips I was using to make 6s lion are not cutting it. once tinned, you should be able to smash it thin. which should make snipping much easier. don't forget to slather it in flux ahead of time"

Help! Trying to update literadio3 to elrs 3 from 2 but betafpv configuration is broken. It’s stuck on loading port number and freezes when I press connect. It’s the latest version too. It did the same with older version. Is it because I’m on windows 11?. Also literadio is definitely recognized in device manager,"That's correct, they do not have that feature :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:"
ok so I had a perfecly flying drone but I needed to try some older betaflight verisons for some reasons and now im back at 4.5 and I had all the data backed up and I loaded that in and now after arming the drone after about 2 seconds in the air it just goes to 100% throttle for like half a second before disarming. any ideas on why this might be happening?. also could it possibly be a hardware issue. also I cant provide blackbox coz the flash chip is fked,"@AirSofmoඩා no PID settings from prior to 4.3 are effective, you will need to fully reset your PID settings to Betaflight defaults and start from there. the backup im using is from 4.5. the quad was flying perfect in 4.5 when I decided to go back to 4.2 for blackbox reasons and now im moving back to 4.5"
Hmm. I think hota cannot discharge over charged batteries. I plugged there 4.4 volts liion its over charged and its writing me its wrong type of battery. Anyone able to help?. Shoud i use it as normal and hope for Best?,"If it's over charged, you can set your charger to NIMH or Pb mode and discharge without the balance lead connected. Discharge it to 4.2V, then switch to Li Ion mode and discharge as normal"
What does it mean if drone is binded but not taking off?,What does it tell you
@DædalusFPV  shoud i set it to 4s so 4.8 volts?,"It’s not saying anything. I’m just looking at my drone and it’s not arming I guess lol. Propellers not spinning What does the osd say Sorry still new to drones. What does that mean haha The text on the screen of your FPV video My controller doesn’t have screen if that’s what you mean Betaflight should be flashing error messages on there. What drone do you have. That’s not what I mean Meteor75. Controller is the dumb literadio 3 In your goggles what do you see Idk where I put it. I gotta find it hahaha I just double-checked on mine to make sure. Switch to Pb Discharge mode, unplug the balance lead, set it to **12V (6S)** (I know it's not actually a 6S battery, you're tricking the charger here), and then run the discharge cycle until you get to your target voltage. DO NOT leave this unattended, as it can ruin your battery. If your charger still complains about it being the wrong battery, set it to 14V and try again"
This seems like great fire tutorial. So 6s and cell voltage 4.2??? And current i am not sure,It is. This is why we generally don't recommend over-charging. Set the discharge current to something like 1C Shoud i rather throw it out You're going to need to discharge it anyway if you just want to trash it. Cell voltage how much. What do you think. Shoud i change something. I think i ll play safe with 0.3 because i have insanely thin wires I think this should work
:grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Wait no 4.1volts i shoud go to?,"Just try it man, keep an eye on it while you do. You're discharging here, which doesn't carry the same risk as charging Only fire :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: maybe You could technically do this with the right resistor I burned case and connector alredy enough soldering for today :) That’s all you’re doing here really, the charger just regulates current though a resistor inside it Too low battery voltage I thought you said you were discharging a 4S pack 4.4 volts liion battery Ugh then set it to 2S (4V)"
What could go wrong btw?,"If you leave the battery overcharged, it will die. If you leave the discharge cycle unattended, it could die. If you do everything right, you get to use your battery for a while longer"
Okey so no fire?. Okey let me try. @DædalusFPV how much volts shoud i unplug it?,"Stop the discharge cycle manually once you're back below a safe voltage. For a single li-ion, that'll be around 4V. From then on, use the li-ion charging mode on your charger Okey so 4volts it is. Its going painfully slow but ye wont risk the damaging the wires. Its working so thanks for help. I really need to buy better wires"
Had 1 charged liion bough another one in storage voltage and charged them :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Then i relized. 4.2 is fully charged liion ye?. How long can i keep it charged?,How did you get a liion to 4.4. That is terrifying my motors sound kinda chunky almost. on my tinywhoop @DædalusFPV i unplugged the battery to check voltage because its not right on charger and now when i want to start it its saying too low its 4.29 They sit happier at 4.1-4.15 but 4.2 is what Internet days Yea 4.15V is the spec but we can get away with 4.2 for hobby purposes. So try it on 1S Wrong battery type. :/
You aren't very likely to fry anything. What are you using it in?,"Goggles or radio. But i will need to charge little bit the other battery then. Because its on 3.8 volts. So it wont go too low when i ll use 2 batteries Charge the other one to 4.0V, then use them together. Anything designed for 2S (8.4V) will handle 4.0+4.3=8.3V Let them run down til they're 3.6 and 3.7, then balance them together What do you think its better goggles or radio Goggles will probably drain them a lot faster than your radio, just sitting on your desk or smth Okey. So 6.3 volts. They are running. 4.16. Nice. Thank for all of your help!!! :))"
Anyone have any nifty way to keep these connectors out of your props?,"All I have is an xbox one controller lol You said once you got the radio. Oh you meant now. Not really i played liftoff for a solid 10 hours on an xbox controller. works fine. your times will go down by like 20 seconds once you get larger gimbals The wire didn't get hit. Just the plastic connector anywho  anyone mind helping me set up my quad, i flashed my controller and receiver but nothing is working on betaflight Take the protector off and secure the lead using the strap. Also that connector looks insanely damaged Yeah funny story. Connector got buzzed and two pins were dangerously close together, so I went to pry them apart with my finger but I think what happened was I shorted it with my finger. You think the connector looks bad.."
What protocol? What hardware?,Did you select the serial rx on the ports tab. and csrf on the receiver tab
Why would you not get ELRS?.... Just about anything you can get for the 4in1 will be garbage compared to it,"Guys what is the best reciever to use with the 4 in 1 boxer, I have no idea what recievers bind to it because it’s my first time using something other than elrs"
why would you not use elrs?,"It’s for my friend, he already bought a 4 in 1 boxer and I have no idea what recievers bind to it most of the older recievers from other brands. usually people get it to bind to spektrum stuff. radiomaster makes a few, like their r86. lemonrx I think as well"
The boxer has a micro module bay correct?,"none of them. lol. You're best off buying a cheapo ELRS module and ELRS receiver, shouldn't be much more expensive. for park fliers line of sight it works fine mostly probably. It's the standard size"
is it easy to hook up the module to it?. or do I need to do a lot of firmware stuff?,"Not very difficult, no"
Hi again. Is there someone that can help me download edgetx on my radiomaster pocket?. Cause now i have a fully blank micro sd card,use the webflasher connect it with your PC select the correct model on the website and press flash. with the sdcard inserted bardwell. joshua bardwell https://tenor.com/view/joshua-bardwell-betaflight-fpv-quadcopter-freestyle-gif-25233617 https://tenor.com/view/fast-as-fuck-joshua-bardwell-fast-bardwell-dji-fpv-gif-23767577
for my new build i want to go with an TBS Unify Pro HV heres a listing in my country https://www.rotorama.cz/product/tbs-unify-pro-hv-25-800mw-40ch-2 but while looking i found the  TBS Unify Pro32 HV which can go up to 1W with almost the same price  https://www.rotorama.cz/product/tbs-unify-pro32-hv is there a reason why these are the same price? should i just go with the pro32?,I believe that the unify pro is designed for race or lighter quads so it is in a smaller and lighter form factor. If you don’t need to fit in to a certain weight you are probably better off with the unify pro 32
Is this wired correct?,What is normal flight time for 4s 2000mah 100c battery Is that for the dji o3 As long as you have made sure TX has gone to RX and rx has gone to tx. I'm not to firmiliar with that iflight FC. I assume that +5v pad is giving more then 5v
how to turn off wifi mode on expresslrs reciver ?,i got the mob7 hd and i need to switch the connector from ph 2.0 too bt 2.0 problem ich cant get the AIO out
I would do that insert there battery and just measure when you will cut if you connector will reach and then decide if ye or no. One question do you think shoud i solder on bt2. 0 on all my batteries and also drone?. 10 batteries,im between 2 options for my tiny whoop cut the wires from the ph 2.0 and solder the bt 2.0 onto the wires of the ph 2.0 or say fuck it try to sell the 25 euros and 10 euros of wires i bought for bt 2.0 and buy ph 2.0 batteries bt2.0 is a better connector. if you alr have the bt2.0 batteries Bt 2.0 i would say its worth it
i thought ur batteries were alr bt2.0?,Ph. I have all pH drone and also batteries. I bough connectors bt 2.0 but didnt use em yet because its risky soldering batteries and my skills in burning connectors are very good then just keep it all as ph2.0
Okey thanks. Anyone knows maybe an answer to this??,"Dont quote me on this, but some goggles  have outputs specifically for this. You will need to see if your goggles have this feature. My posibble outputs are usb c or micro hdmi. And usb c is for power. But i am not sure if its output gonna go see no idea with those sorry bud. I dont know aswell :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"

Can i use tx5 instead of tx1 for my receiver if tx 5 is vacancy?,"thanks guys i didnt expect reply that fast Uarts are general purpose, the number isnt important. But if you need to wire a receiver/peripheral to tx and rx you need to use one uart, like tx5 and rx5, dont use tx5 and rx4"
Does anyone know why there is a short there (I used a smoke stopper but it shorted out in the esc anyway)? (it’s a slow mo recording),"you are aware that it's not good for the esc if there are sparks, even if they are less than 1/2A Yes that‘s why im trying to fix it. than why are you plugging in the battery to film the sparks even if you know it's killing the electronics Because I removed the capacitor and wanted to see if it was the cause and I filmed it in order to have something to show. But ig it wasn’t the capacitor.. It‘s a bit wierd because I was binding the rx to the remote and after some time it sparked  and I have no clue as to why."
Is it normal for my camera to get kinda hot while the drone is on? I have a meteor85 2022,"probably. if it work it work Fair enough. Also is it recommended to put your VTX power to max I've heard it overheats them or something idk only place you shouldn't is on Walksnail. if it overheats you should just fly faster I mean, if it's rated to go to say 1w, it's because it's designed to go to 1w (with adequate airflow) you can also just put the power level on a switch"
Will a longer mmcx to sma cable affect my vtx signal much? The extra length helps me route for a new tpu mount.,"Alright, I ordered them cause I snapped a mmcx off in my vtx. Luckily fished the plug out and bent the little port back"
Why are there 3 checkboxes?,"presets. 1, 2 and 3. on the top of the preview you can switch between them"
does anybody have an idea why it’s sparking? would greatly appreciate any help.,"In betaflight I set the power to 400 but in the user manual it says the max is 350mW it dun work like that. basically smartaudio (what you're using to talk to the VTX) is a one-way thing. all betaflight can do is just send the ""power value"" to the vtx. and hope it was right. it doesn't know if it was really"
Like in betaflight the next option down is 200 so I can't set it to 350. How can I set it to 350 exactly?,400 probably is 350. if that's what it came with/correct vtx table. then 400 is 350 I have the power received by the goggles and the set vtx power on my osd so we will see once I get my goggles. well again. your osd won't really know. like if it's set up correctly then it knows. if not then it doesn't. since it's one-way
Anybody know what angle amount I should set for arming? Landed on my roof and couldn’t re arm due to the angle. Was pretty mad at myself lol.,U can fail the test as often as you want. How is the return policy for banggood
hello i got quick question is this https://www.koptery.cz/separatni/f4-aio-elrs/ and this https://www.fyft.cz/f4-5a-aio-fc-betafpv-1s-elrs-24g/ and this https://www.6sfull.cz/f4-1s-5a-aio-brushless-flight-controller/ the same thing cause not every shop got it so im asking and is this https://www.koptery.cz/vysilace/tbs-unify-pro32-nano-v1-1/ and https://www.6sfull.cz/tbs-unify-pro32-nano-5g8/ the same thing too??,"I made some pictures (left side is normal and right is the side which sparks) with my macro lens, maybe that helps with diagnosing."
i tested with a multimeter and cleaned the esc and it seems to no longer have any issues as I plugged my battery in after testing no continuity. Should I put some conformal coating on the part that burnt a bit?,That's what the VTX table is for BF requires you to input a VTX table which defines what power levels and channels the VTX supports @furthefur
Can someone recommend me a reasonably priced 6S lipo charger?,Hota D6 Pro. Or a cheaper DC ToolkitRC charger with a PSU
What psu would I need for that?,"It's a pretty wide voltage range, you just need a handful of watts depending on what you're charging."
Any specific toolkitrc charger you’d recommend?,M6D is a nice dual channel one. https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging
Right ok and psu wise what would be the most suitable? Any recommendations?,Most FPV stores (Like RaceDayQuads in the US) sell power supplies that are quite bulky. you can also find cheapo telekom ones on eBay
"There are ones with built in PSUs if you prefer like me. The Pro version of the Hota D6, I think? It's just much heavier so if you're putting it in a backpack there's more weight on your shoulders",yup. also the F6+ that has 4 channels
Alright thanks is there like a minimum wattage I should be looking for?. I’ll have a look thanks,"even a 100W is probably enough for the average person. but you can get way more than that for cheap I’d be charging maybe 5 6s 1300-1500 batteries per day I would personally splurge on either a Hota F6+, or I would get a cheap (and thus huge) power supply off of eBay and a bunch of those cheap ToolkitRC chargers and shove it in a box I’ll have a look, what would I have to search to get the eBay psus to come up I can’t seem to find much I don't know honestly, even a power supply for a server or computer would work just search ""power supply"" anything that output the right voltage with enought amps will work fine really. you will just need a little diy to make it work"
Really? I think I probably have a spare 600w pc psu lying around the house,"yeah that'd probably work. you'd need to wire an xt60 to it. to plug it into the charger(s) I’ll give it a go, thanks for all the help"
"Hi! I have a quick question. I want to get into drones and learn more about the whole field, but I'm not sure where to start. I made a parts list for both a 6S and 3S drone but I'm not sure which is best for a beginner. What kind of drone would you reccomend for a beginner wo just wants to try stuff out?","$200-$300. maybe a bit more https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639/1144567226670788639 I kind of wanna build one from parts myself because it seems like a fun project, but I just don't know what size is best to start with. I see online that there are some fc's and esc's that can be used with anything from 3s to 6s so I don't know if I should just go for the 3s and then maybe upgrade to the 6s later or just go straight for the 6s. there are also like different frame sizes and i see some people saying that 5' ones are much harder to fly. so I'm just trying to get a general idea of what i should be looking for So, size wise, with your budget, you should start with a micro (65mm-3"") a 5"" would be like 200-300$ alone, without the radio/goggles etc, and going from 3s to 6s will require swapping the motors, when it comes to the size, you have 65mm for indoors, 75mm for indoors&outdoors, and 2""(85mm)+ for outdoors"
"Alright, that makes sense. i have a couple other questions. would 3d printing the frame be a dumb idea? because it seems like a fun little project and probably not too difficult","It would be a very dumb idea if it's bigger than maybe a 2"". Well, even if it's 2"" or smaller it would be dumb what makes it such a bad idea Vibrations and durability oh so itd probably just break. ok so would it make sense to get a stack thats capable of both 3s and 6s in case i decide to upgrade down the line So, thing is that putting a 3s motor on 6s voltage will basically make the motor melt, because there is something called kv (rpm per volt) and the amperage is a function of the kv and voltage, so if you add voltage without adjusting the kv you will burn the motor. Also, 3s is only suitable for like a 2.5-3"" ok so basically i would have to switch the frame, motors, and battery to upgrade it, but its doable Eh, on a 2.5""-3"" you would want an aio, and if you go over a 3.5"" an aio isn't really useful suitable anymore All In One. Fc and esc (sometimes Rx and vtx too) sandwiched into one board"
"oh so a stack isnt viable for a 3""?","It is, it's just not ideal. It would be a better idea to just build a say 3"", then building another say 5"" and have 2 quads So you don't end up with useless batteries/motors and frame alright. thank you for the help i really appreciate it"
Which one?. TRUST you can fail a bunch part 107 you have to pay to retake. What do you mean a camera drone?. One with a built in camera? A drone that can lift a camera like a dslr?. Something you can put a gopro on?,"#camera-drones we have a channel for these. In almost all cases a camera drone is a DJI style drone, if it's designed to carry a full-sized camera or bigger it's a cinelifter, and usually if you just want to put a GoPro on top it's just an fpv quad I have set up my drone in betaflight. And I also get feedback from the respective positions of the sticks under receiver, but when I connect the drone with the lipo I can't control the drone. what does the osd say it only says low power mode"
OSD says low power mode?. Is this digital?,its a caddx nebula pro. i get this in betaflight. and the OSD channel Betaflight missing
Hey! I got an EMAX BHELI 40A ESCs. I'm building a drone using a fpga board :worried_face:  and its going great! although I've tackled one prob rn - all the motors are going CCW. ofc I can swap 2 of 3 wires of the motors I need reversed but its my last way to go.  To my question - is there a way to program the specific motors(I can disconnect the good ESCs) using only transmitter(throttle) to reverse their direction? thanks :slightly_smiling_face:,"For blheli ones you need a flight controller or programmer board, and this: https://esc-configurator.com/ Okay. the problem is bc I'm using a fpga and I'm basically building all from sketch - also designing the system itself. it cant communicate with the esc-configurator and disassembling it is too complicated. I've seen this [file](https://www.tme.eu/Document/959503479e9fa7b0e61049c62875b2e2/BLHeli%20Instruction.pdf) and it explained about transmitter programming yet I'm not sure it will work.. so disassembling the escs and swapping two wires of the motor itself to the esc is also not possible. my last resort is having to solder anything out. Implement BLHeli passthrough, flash the ESCs using something like an FTDI, plug the ESCs into an off-the-shelf flight controller"
"Is there a reason I should use tx2/rx2 for my elrs receiver instead of tx1/rx1?. The FC manual says to use t/rx1, the receiver manual says to use t/rx2. I know i can change it back and forth in betaflight -- but is there a reason to or not to use one or the other?",it doesn't matter. uarts are generic. pick whichever are free. tx to rx and rx to tx
How do i know if tx1/rx1 is being used by something internally on the FC?,It wouldn't be exposed if it was used internally
ok so my radiomaster pocket works. and is on edge tx. im making some custom tracks. the tracks are done. ive imported them. selected the tracks. and no sound?. is it cause its a 3 min long audio track?. how do i make it work. can someone please help me?,you need a specific audio format and bitrate ask in https://discord.gg/2ukGBpuj
"This is my first time using a rp-sma to ufl connector. Few questions.   First of, have I put this together correctly.  The ring, then the nut?.  Secondly, the copper cable if a few cm long. Is it OK to bend this a bit? Or will it fuck with the connection?",The ring is to bite into i assume a 3d printed mount and the nut is just the nut.. Bending is fine just not a really sharp bend Only thing i will say (from experience) is be careful not to twist the sma mount when you screw the antenna on. To much and itll break the antenna wire Ah good to kmow thank you. Bloody 15cm long end to end. Might be a but to long need to see if they sell them shorter. Get a pigtail adapter if you can. Mine is 5ish cm long

Well maybe not RP sma but you get the idea,ye wish I saw that earlier. Not sure if that would fit my tpu. I'll see if I can make these unecessarily long cable fit :p. if not might have to explore that as an options. ty for the link. ill just turn the 03 air unit 180c. that way the antenna socket on the air unit is further away. That will get rid of the necessity to bend the cables.
Did you arm it?.. o3 remains in low power mode to prevnt over heating until you arm it. Once arm it should kick it out of low power mode,yes still the same issue
the uart are the spots where i can solder the wire?,"You need to change this. It should be msp+vtx something along those lines. Change save and try arming again I believe that's what the issue is.. Your o3 is on uart 1 and you need to enable the vtx as a peripheral by selecting msp+displayport. Let me plug a drone in so u can see yes, for example.  If you wired the o3 to TX3 RX3 that means its uart3. If you did TX2 RX2 that means it uart2.. Have a look at the FC confirm which uart you put the o3 on. Here is my dji o3 drone.. It is connected to UART1 and under periphirals I have this option enabled Yes but did you solder it to uart 1.. Ah yes I can see from the picture that you have.   Are you 100% sure that your have soldered rx to tx and tx to rx. The rx and Typ yes. I only did + and - at the top of BAT and GND so that it was not on at +5V at the bottom Try a different uart."
"Did you properly cross-over the RX and TX lines? (Narrator: *no*). White needs to be soldered to the FC's TX pad, gray to the FC's RX pad","Yes i messed up with the wires, sorry for that... Hopefully that should now give you the option on ports tab no still not, but after arming the popup goes away"
Fair enough. Looks like the problem is solved.  Osd works and everything?,"Not quite I don't know how to record with the O3 You set that option in your goggles. As the quality of the goggles is not exactly super If you just go into the options, there is a option to record when you arm. Then you can choose to record with goggles only the air unit or both when you arm."
"got it, my sd card are just to slow. what would be a good one?","You need at least a V30 card. Sandisk and Kingston both make good options hey there, i'm considering getting the ag01 gimbals for my boxer, and I was wondering if somebody went from the v4 gimbals to the ag01, cause I already lubed my gimbals with some switch lube and now they feel already pretty good, so I don't know if getting the ag01 would be a worthwhile purchase or not"
got a question does it makes sense to fly 750mah xt30 batteries on 1s 75mm analog tinywhoop ?,"not really. you will be better off with 450-550mah with a bt2.0 damn ;s I could use my 1s batteries that I use for my toothpick 1s. but it looks like I need to buy another battery pack ;p yeah, 750mah is rather large for a 75mm 1s"
Does it have metal in it?. (hint: no),"if i covered a gps ceramic with a thin sheet of tape how badly would it affect signal If normal tape, no effect. If metal tape, effect I got them.. It's a luxury upgrade that's all. They really do feel and sound great.. But that's all your paying for"
Got a quick video?. Of the drone doing thid,That's I Term windup. @CeredD#77 I-term wind-up by itself shouldn't initiate runawy protection
Ok no the error comes when I go up a few thirds.. Whats that?,"Put props on and it won't happen. He has props off that's why it's happening without props on, arming without load (drag from props) will cause the motors to spin up and compensate. As the others said, simply putting props on will solve the issue"
So i Can later Test Fly?,"I'll try it out and if something goes wrong I'll get back to you :face_with_tears_of_joy: 100% normal. you said it flys 20cm high! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: which confused the hell out of me.. Here's a query out to the community. Someone is selling cheap o3 air units as he cannot get them to bind.  Claims they are only 2 months old and not been battered. Apparently just stopped working all of a sudden.  ***""Please read, these are 2 Dji03 air units that have decided not to bind anymore. They light up like normal but with the green light there is a tiny orange light too. These have generated the same fault. Only 2 months old and not been battered. £80 each as will be a bargain to someone that can fix these things""***  Tempted to purchase one, if I can get it a bit cheaper, but wondering if anyone here has experienced this and if its actually fixable. Or else, you pick it up at his house and try to bind it before buying the o3 well they dont work, so thats the risk. You buy it in hope to try and get it to work.. just  wondering if anyone has encountered the  problem described  above"
"got another quesiton I bought 18650 that I want to use for my 1s toothpick for long range I want to solder xt30 on it, can i charge it with vihfly whoopstar charger ?",if you do ph2.0 or bt2.0 then yea
ops :face_with_tongue:. so for 18650 should I use 4.2 too ?,odds are you 1s lipos are lihv. yea
Hey guys is there way to check my binding phase from elrs RM zorro without flashing?,"Oh shoot yea now did i change the password on it or is it stock It should just be `expresslrs` I upgraded and it helped my quadcopters remain stable (less drift) during poshld, after I tuned the new gimbals. They are a bit more durable too. If you have the $$$ it is a good upgrade...but like others have stated, it not something you should feel is required."
"I am concerned for:  The Receiver (that will get chopped off, soon) The VTX (no antenna?)  The motor wires","I like how you don't specify what ""this"" means while showing multiple concerning things What are the concerning things all that pretty much, plus the camera shake Theres an antenna its just not in the vid"
Ahh but the battery sits near the front?. It would be crushed. But is it a risk that my props will cut the receiver?. Or that it will just fall off. This is my first self built bearing in mind. So the solders are awful,"Like where would the elrs poke out The receiver is supposed to be inside of the drone, not outside.... only the antenna goes out. and then you can just strap the antenna under one of the arms the ideal space for a receiver is usually between the stack and camera as there tends to be lots of unused space and is far away from other RF emitting crap Ah but on the tutorial it was further to the back. And next to the lollipop antenna yeah and imo that's not a great idea. sticking a sensitive receiver right next to a powerful transmitter. and in a location where you'll get worse signal when flying back home than when flying away Ahh good point. 1 sec my dad is protesting. He likes it at the back Tell him that someone who's been building, flying, fixing and helping with drones for 6 years now is telling you that it's not a great idea, especially with how it is currently executed.. The receiver is a very sensitive... receiver.  Having a VTX blasting right next to it at many hundreds of times more power than it's listening for, even on a different frequency, is not great.. Having the antenna on the back also causes the annoying problem of ""turning to fly home and losing signal"". since if the antenna is at the back, when you're flying back home, the frame has a pretty high chance of obscuring it. and the carbon fiber frame is a very effective signal blocker"
what's that black wire thing for?,"If you are talking about the antenna, it's so the vtx can output video without exploding"
Isn't the pro worse?. not on the 65 apparently. so confusing. Meteor 75 > Meteor 75 Pro. Meteor 65 Pro > Meteor 65,"That antenna on the 65 pro sucks. Now i get Great video,and  very bad washout :grinning_squinting_face: i got my 65 pro doa and im so pissed rn. i have nothing to fly:loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: if you're talking about the original whip flying around, then you (or anyone who has the problem) might need [this](https://www.printables.com/model/729327-meteor65-pro-antenna-restrainer) :winking_face:"
"How do I change the camera (Air 3) while using the goggles 3? typically I have them mapped to a function key however that mapping does not seem to apply whilst using the goggles. I also want to know how to connect the goggles to my computer or phone so I can watch movies and such with them. every document says to use an ""OTG"" cable that should have come with the goggles, I got a USB-C/USB-C cable",I don't really care enough to spend $.003 on some tpu. I'd rather go look at another brand.
"It takes 10x the heat to solder the ground on my mobula 6, am I gonna fry something if I actually give it the heat it wants?. The positive is instant solder",The ground runs throughout the whole board so they do typically take longer for the solder to flow. The board will get hot.
By yellow you mean the third pin of the thing that comes out of the ESC?,"How do I plug in the connectors in a MATEKSYS ExpressLRS 2.4GHz Receiver - PWM ELRS-R24-P6 Solder the wires directly or solder headers I soldered the pin headers. I mean. Like I dont know how to connect power and servos. Like to use the receiver. I dont get it Red is 5v. Black is ground. Yellow is your pwm/signal They go vertical, plugging it in the wrong way wont break anything. It just wont work"
Its flashing red. Now its blinking fast. How do I connect servos?,Same way you connected the esc
In the other pins?. Same colour wires oh. Thanks a lot. How do I connect my radiomaster pocket to it?,I read about the flashing and stuff
https://youtu.be/J3Hg2f7RL1A?si=7RvQ6i46G4_btYyi. Thats should get you started dont flash till you feel confident,"This is great to get familiar with the process, but I'd definitely follow the official documentation for the up to date steps That too, just thought a video would be easier to follow I found the WiFi hotspot the receiver is emitting but what's the password That receiver apparently comes with a bind phrase already set.. Its 123456. Bind phrase is basically a password so only a controller with that phrase can bind and control it. Yeah I found the web ui and changed it to 666999. But how do I enter it in my radiomaster pocket. No need to change the firmware its at 3.1 something Same why you did it on the receiver, connecting via wifi. Youll need to use the expresslrs lua script.. It might already be downloaded or might not. https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/getting-started/ @Hemu this will have everything you need. If you stuck check youtube or ask for help. I gtg anyway. Might be back in an hour or two Cya. I still need help. When I go to the tx's WiFi and try to change the bind number and save, it says error"
Anybody that uses speedybee tx800?,"tons of people use tx800 clones. why. Flash with binding phrase, it needs an update anyways Okay. I cant update that fails as well you realize that's not helpful right. I need to see the error and the wiring I cant update the firmware. Of the pocket"
You're using the edgetx passthrough method of course?,And the pocket doesn't let me change the binding phrase either. Wifi. The WiFi web ui method There's an absolutely huge warning. at the top of the page. telling you you can't do that the first time. it fills my whole screen
"Hey there, would there be any sensible reason why swapping a frame could make a quad fly like shit and make the range a lot worse too ? Cause I moved from a pirate frames gems (toothpick style 2"" frame) to a bassline frame, which is stiffer, but my quad flies like crap, has some fly-aways and the video range is crappy even if all I did was putting the components from one frame to another","unless the frame is the most poorly designed frame ever or there's something very wrong no So I need to connect the pocket to my laptop Well the bassline is stiffer than the mob8 and gems frame it was on before, so I don't understand why the pid tuning wouldn't work anymore, especially since the weight is still about the same and flash it using edgetx passthrough. The Mob8 tune is very specific. so Yeah but it flew really well on the gems, and I tried the bassline tune (I use the exact same components as the bassline) and it flew even worse I get an error in the elrs configurator ` raise Exception('No valid serial port detected or port already open') Exception: No valid serial port detected or port already open`"
is the cable a data cable?,"Yes, the Speedybee one is also a clone of a really bad VTX. hence it is so cheap, because you can get it cheaper somewhere else"
What is good vtx for good price?. Than,"anything that isn't a tx800 at this point. RUSH and TBS are the best Foxeer, iFlight, whatever are fine too"
Is there any good options from ali?,I think it doesn't work anymore all of that is on Ali my phone is not picking up anymore
I will order it when i get refund for tx 800. But can i ask why is it bad. ?,"I honestly don't know the specifics, I just know that it is probably the worst you can get... It doesn't produce a clean signal.. You're supposed to before you flash"
What range can i expect using this one?,depends on your goggles and area
is it?. I thought it wasn't,combined with a nice patch as much as you're going to get
Wait i will send you my setup. Is it good?,Than very good. Got this deal for 100 euros
Anyone know of a good 6 in 1 or 8 in 1 esc? Or can I somehow wire two 4 in 1s together,"There's no reason you can't use two 4-in-1 ESCs, as long as your FC has 8 motor pins Well I only need 6, I'm thinking it may just be better to do a pdb and individual escs Yea I see a couple 8-in-1 options but no hex options Looks like my y6 dreams are crashed, can't find anything that'd work that doesn't weigh a ton or cost 300 for one esc You can still do independent ESCs. Matek makes a Hex PDB. Or you can make your own harness Matek pdb has horrible pad designs, I thought there was way more support on the market for x8 Imagine rejecting a functional piece of hardware because you don't like the shape of the solder pads. Beggars can't be choosers would. never using an aio again"
@DædalusFPV would a 4 in 1 and an 2 individual escs soldered to vbat and ground work?,"Yes, it would work. Ideally your individuals should be as close as possible to the 4-in-1 in terms of specifications. It's pretty crucial that they all run the same firmware"
https://github.com/ExpressLRS/repartitioner. From the warning you sent. But if I just plug a usb-c into the top and select edgetx passthrough I should be good I think?,"When you don't use the WiFi option, you don't have to do any of that Just use EdgeTX Passthrough (which is easier anyways) and you can just flash the latest without a hassle https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/tx-prep/. should i do this stuff It should all be set up for you from factory. that part at least"
amazing thanks. theres a elrs lua script already on the boxer but am i right in saying i have to flash it anyway to set my binding phrase up on it?,You can technically set it by using the WiFi. But ELRS has updated and learning how to flash is easy Hm similar to the other guy before I get 'No valid serial port detected or port already open' too. Using cable that came with the boxer. I think the elrs ver was 3.3 so I think I can avoid the repartitioner and just use wifi
Did you follow step 3?,"Of the guide. <https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/> Yeah, hit edgetx passthrough Yes but specifically step 3 tells you to check if all the drivers and such are working Scroll down on the page after clicking the EdgeTX Passthrough option at the top.

ill send them back since they dont fit the mount anyways. i plugged one of them in for about 10 seconds to see if i bound it up right im guessing i cant send that back?,they won't know. frankly if they do accept battery returns they're kind of dumb ah ok its not the end of the world if i have to keep them its only about £10 you can probably find DOGCOM or Airjacker batteries on every corner

Can I waterproof my drone with this nail polish?,I mean... yes. It's better to just buy 422C though
im leaving for vacation in a few days. and it cant get delivered fast enough. Is there anything I should be carefull with using nail polish?,"Avoid buttons, connectors and sensors"
do I apply it on the pins of the connecters?,you specifically *don't*

Any issues with being next to vtx antenna (dji o3),"The receiver won't care too much about the vtx, obviously it's not ideal, but it's fine, it won't affect it as much as the gps, and you aren't doing long range on a cinewhoop anyway"
I bought a moz7 for longrange and it came with bf 4.4.2. Is it worth upgrading to 4.5 for better gps rescue or is there no big difference?,You can always read the release notes and decide for yourself https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/release/betaflight-4-5-release-notes
THATS A BUDGET ONE???. DAM,"well you never said what budget low budget could be 10 dollars it could be 10000 dollars EV800D are the lowest it gets, and they're a 100 dollars"
Does it have all of those?,One of these plus your computer https://www.amazon.com/Receiver-Female-Plastic-Android-Monitor/dp/B07Q5MPC8V/ref=mp_s_a_1_4. Of course the quality will be terrible and the latency will be unflyable. But the second part doesn’t matter if you’re just recording. Oh wait you said goggles
how do i setup acro mode? Had before Headfree in modes and when i activate AUX4 then it says acro mode on.but according to Betaflight it was headfree. I also flew today and crashed 2 times because it didn't feel like acro mode.,Headfree is dumb. Acro is the default mode when you aren't in any other mode
"Both of my front screws slipped when screwing and seem worn out now. Extreme resistance once I reached the marked part in red, stupidly I kept turning it and so it now seems to be flattened.   Any pro tips on what to do now? Cant get it up or down lol, buying new screws tomorrow","If all that happened is you hollowed the screw head, you can simply use some big pliers and unscrew, or solder a screwdriver to it after sanding the surface, or making a new screw head with a Dremel"
"ye tried with pliers no luck, will look for smaller ones tomorrow.  Soldering a screwdriver is an interesting idea, will try that, my friend suggested superglue might also work. Do you have any idea why I was met with such resistance? It was almost like it didnt fit in the second part, both screws on the front showed resistance quite early.","Super glue isn't strong enough, as for the resistance, I don't see what would be the issue unless you had dried loctite inside, or tried to put a metric screw in an imperial nut, or if the nuts/screws are really bad quality and the treads stick out further on one, idk honestly, I'm just throwing idea at the wall. Cause the screw size is pretty standardized for mini quads, we just use m3, so unless you bought some m3.1 if that's a thing, but the first nuts should have showed resistance too yeah idk, used TBS source one v5 and speedybee 4in1 ESC,  feels like there shouldn't be a problem. The holes are surely lined up properly I just don't see why the rear screws wouldn't have an issue but the front ones would I started with the one that got stuck, then moved onto the two on the opposite side which worked fine, the other one on the same side gave way though.. No it makes no sense lol, I am thinking if I somehow assembled incorrectly but cant see what would be wrong. managed to get one screw out,  I tried my reserve screw from the other side and it went through no problem, then I tried screwing it in from right way and it just gets  stuck once it reaches the press washers it just stops This is a question more about electronics than drones specifically but i bought a 12A Simonk ESC for a model plane and it works fine at first but seemingly randomly when i move the right gimble to move control surfaces it just resets an does the start-up beep noises. the servos continue to work during this time its only then motor that stops and then when lowered and re-raised the throttle will it begin again. I think it may have something to do with the fact it is a programmable ESC but i lost the instructions that came with it and cant find them online."
no way they are clock wise and counter clockwise right?,"No, all screws have the same thread orientation"
I need to waterproof my drone before I leave for vacation and real conformal coating can’t be delivered fast enough. Would it be better to use nail polish or liquid tape to waterproof my drone?,"WTF my reserve screw just INSTANTLY became hollowed out, it literally barely hit the block, I was barely applying force and it just snapped wtf not the velos in the backround :loudly_crying_face: I am Swedish what can I say,  unironically though my exams just finished up so after this bag its over until next exam period in october :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:"
oh CRSF is correct. but I think it should be internal RF no?. unless you have an ELRS module on it?,Baudrate should be set to 5.25M Yeah it totally is lemme change that lol. Ok now it works. Thank you :)
"Guys, 04x v2 can record 60fps right? been using it for half a year now and i've noticed my recent dvrs are in 50fps. is that because of pal/ntsc or goggles setting? i doubt it's the latter since i couldnt find anything in there. If it's really about the video format then I guess i'll have to stick with pal since my aio wont take ntsc. just tried it out today and the osd isnt showing at all so...",Ok so the controller won't bind with the drone and i'm pretty sure the firmware versions are incompatible. I have no idea what to do
sadge. is that vtx dependent or osd chip dependent?,"I believe it's actually set by the camera That's a switchable camera, it can do both pal and ntsc. Not at the same time, obviously"
do i just switch it with the joy stick board?,perfect thanks. i'll give it a go
is there a drone simulator that uses a flight controller for controlling the drone?,"hmm. tryp. it has corporated with betaflight to make flight dynamic more realistic like a drone simulator that uses a flight controller instead of just virtual values, it takes data from the flight controller to give a more realistic experience"
that simulates the whole physical world instead of just gyro values?. i think what tryp did is the closest _reasonable_ simulation,"not the whole physical world but just simulate a drone flying in a simulator using flight controller one could simulate a physical fc virtually, like many machines run virtualization... whats the benefit of connecting a drone to it. its not what makes the experience more realistic. just that one could transfer the same betaflight config for example"
How can i do that and which simulator?,no thats not possible i mean it would be possible to program. i dont think anyone would do that because theres only marginal benefit
ok. @dantiel Do you know any good agriculture drone  simulators?,i dont think there is... mostly agriculture run on autopilot
"yes thats the goal. no but seriously guys, can anyone give me an explanation? Nearly all my screws went hollow so it really feels as if I did something wrong, the tool I used had the exact size and I didnt use unecessarily high amount of force, they went hollow after just one ""slip"", most of them at least..

So odd. I haven’t been able to get my aux 1 to work in Betaflight since I’ve bought it. It only seems to work when aux 3 and 4 are at 0. Anyone know how to fix a switch. I know it works for sure I get movement in controller. Actually I realized all my switched have to be down in order for it to work. Is there a way to change this?,@miketyson send screenshots of the Inputs and Mixes pages on the radio
Can be flux left exposed to Air may it solidify or something??i7,Channel 5 is aux 1. When channels 6-8 are at 100 channel 5 works. But when channels 6-8 are at -100 channel 5 is disabled. (Channels 5-8 are my switches)
why won't you send what I'm asking for?,How would I setup a 3 axis gimbal to use live gyro data as it's flying to kinda self stabilize I can’t find it in the menu at all

"What are you trying to set up about failsafe?. With ELRS, failsafe works out of the box.. I am worried that you misunderstand what Failsafe is :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:",Yeah I have elrs. I’m noticing it’s fine when I set it up then when I hit the switch for failsafe it gets stuck in failsafe and I can’t get out of it disabling controls
Do I do gps rescue instead of failsafe in modes?,"Failsafe is the process the drone goes through when it detects a loss of control signal. The mode is there to let you externally trigger it, but when it's triggered, the drone will operate as if it didn't have control signal.. If you want to manually trigger GPS rescue, use GPS rescue. What happens during Failsafe is set in the Failsafe tab (expert mode). Assigning the failsafe mode to a switch is definitely not a normal thing to do."
Damn. Does anyone rec a good elrs receiver with 1 long antenna?,".. read :loudly_crying_face:. otherwise, anything from RadioMaster probably if you already have that receiver and tell me what firmware it's got, I can point you to a firmware that will work... but expect no support from ELRS team."
"why not find it out then?. power it up, wait for it to go to wifi mode, connect to its wifi, send a screenshot","I’m not sure the firmware I got this receiver a couple months ago, and put some random firmware that I thought might be good on it. I flew it and got rx loss not to far away so I’m assuming it’s wrong or the receiver is crap xD"
It’s not anywhere online. That’s pretty surprising. This is what’s on it now. Maybe I could do DIY device?. Or they have “generic targets used as a base 2.4ghz”. For the sologood mini version that I have it says it’s used betafpv lite 2400rx firmware. Should I use Betaflight then you think?,"flash what's on it now what. use betafpv lite 2400rx firmware If the receiver looks like this, you want the BetaFPV Nano 2.4GHz RX target as it has a PA/LNA."
I keep getting d shot telem flag warning. My protocol is set to dshot600. Do I need to have bi directional d shot on? All my ESC are good on same 32.9. It goes away when I turn bi directional d shot off,You need to flash your ESC with Bluejay

how. the screw on the bottom?,there's a little c clip on the bottom. or whatever it is on your motor. take that off and then you can just pull the bell off oh. but i dont see any physical damage. hmm. ok
You've tried swapping it to a different esc right?,"yep. the motor still dont work well somethings up. so taking it apart will give you a clearer view. can check if the bell is straight, magnets are busted etc just dissassebled it. nothing looks to be damaged honestly gimme a min. here. oh shoot i gotta go out now. bye"

What is a sub 250 gram freestyle fpv quad. That come with Dji receiver. My budget for the quad is about $300. Helllo?,V30 or higher from Sandisk or Kingston is my usual recommendation
I have to admit I dont even know if there are only Receivers for drones. What is your radio?,By receiver I meant it is jut connect to Dji controller and goggles
Dji goggles 2 and Dji remote 2. Hello?,"There are no separate DJI receivers For the Remote 2 your would either need the DJI O3 Air unit, Air Unit Full or a Caddx Vista. All of those are pretty expensive $300 is not enough to get into DJI, tbh--just the DJI hardware eats up that budget I was going to get the Geprc smart 35 hd but it got like discontinued you need to save up more money for digital Or you need good deals with buying used things the issue is the controller Hold up some time, lemme make something"
Do you have Lipos and a charger already?,The only thing I’m factoring into the cost rn for this is the drone itself
are you able to join voice 1???,"If you would be able to join Voice 1 i could show you a great deal. That would work pretty good for you. If you dont want to its okay, just say it Can you send the link cuz I can’t join voice"
"yeah. https://www.ebay.de/itm/355715203920?var=624806575403. You can buy the HD ELRS Variant, then disconnect the ELRS and connect the Caddx Vista SBUS and GND for the DJI Radio to work",Just for clarification cause I’m new even if it says it has ELRS as long as it has caddex vista I can connect DJI goggles 2 and DJI remote 2
"I checked shipping, it ships to the USA and with 3$ more it ships somewhere around next Month. You would have to desolder the ELRS Receiver and then probably solder on two more wires from the caddx vista for the radio to work. Also probably have to change some settings in Betaflight, but you have many here to help (including me). Just make sure you have some screwdrivers and a soldering iron.

Then wait. gonna take some time. to write this That’s fine thank you for helping **""Normal"" (non DJI Radio):** You have a seperate Receiver that is connected to the Flight Controller. The seperate Receiver has direct connection to the radio.  **DJI Radio:** You dont have a seperate Receiver and the Radio Transmission is done by the Goggles to the Air unit, which is connected to the Flight Controller. So the Radio send data to the goggles and the goggles sends them to the drone.,   If you want to use the Air Unit as your receiver, you need to connect 2 extra wires that are normally not connected, because the seller thinks you will put a seperate Receiver in there and not use the Air Unit as your receiver. Its really just two wires, but you probably have to solder them onto the Air Unit too (there are extra Pads for them). You dont need to solder or build anything else.  Also you should check on the DJI Ban in the USA, because this is DJI shit  @Gavin Is there a drone simmaler to the one I sent you that I can just connect and not have to solder. @Noah I dont think so, no. If you would have a ""normal"" Radio then yes sure but no one really uses the DJI Radio on those drones. nearly everyone here would help you on the soldering btw After I solder it what would I do. Isn’t it something with the Dji assistant app or something Maybe change 1 or 2 settings in Betaflight (we would help you) and then fly. Idk i dont think so Oh I thought you paired the goggles and controller with Dji assistant app You pair the goggles with the Caddx Vista (just 2 Button presses, i have a Vista too) and then you connect the Radio to the goggles But you need to solder it first Do you think there is a yt video on how to solder the wires There are a *lot* of tutorials Not those specific thing, but you can send the pictures and ill tell you everything. I could show you on my Caddx Vista in a stream if you want Can I add you on discord so you can help me when I get the drone You should also buy some small wires, if you dont have any. I dont think there are some coming with the drone. You need atleast two short one. chillout Thank you for helping me"

Can be flux left exposed to Air may it solidify or something??,i think so yea. well depends. what flux do you have So if i leave it in tube and maybe tape the end it shoud be fine. Tbx flux
in that syrringe thing?,"Ye. https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/tbs-flux-6849.html. *sry i missspelled the name all good. nah that shouldnt solidify, pretty sure"
Do you think its better in surringe or in container?,"i personally have in a container but surrine is better i think. way easier, faster to apply. i just never bought any flux and just used some i found lol"
Oh okey one think i have alredy flux that is like you need to clean it shoud i change to tbs one?,if you have flux that is conductive you should defo switch I didnt mean that the flux is like that you need to clean it  so means if you touch it it stains you. Shoud i change it
i heard the flux in the container is best... and you can use a toothpick to apply it to the area if it's small... do you use bluejay configurator?,I like flux pens personally. And ESC-Configurator is the tool of choice Yes. On every BLHeli-S ESC I own
what is your total budget?,"Anyone quickly assist with board orientation. I've tried what I think is the correct numbers under board and sensor alignment but for the life of me cannot get this quad to turn the right way.  Currently: Yaw = opposite movement (yaw with quad left it goes right). Pitch = Pitch up goes down and down goes up Roll = It kind of roll at a off angle but in the right direction. Set those all back to default and adjust and check the other one. I think its gyro 1 or something Its what ever setting that would be here if i wasnt in virtual mode What drone, goggles, and remote do you guys recommend to a beginner depends on your budget I need it to be sub 250g. I’m not really sure on a budget. What do you recommend d the budget mainly defines if you have to go analog or digital I’d rather digital. Is the emax babyhawk II good no it's quite bad. most things from emax are. they make some decent motors though. for reference. Walksnail goggles are 450 USD HDZero Goggles are around 600 USD Analog Cobra X goggles are around 250 USD Analog EV800D are around 100 USD. and for the digital options you basically add a 100 USD for every quad for the video transmitter and camera. being much more expensive What about the Dji integra goggles The one that says default DJI is way more restricted, the goggles are cheaper but the VTX and such are about the same price. way less features. about the same performance as Walksnail though. tiny bit better But isn’t Dji integra cheaper the goggles are cheaper, they're also worse and have basically no features and the VTX's still cost a fortune like all the other digital systems And another $100 for the HDZero goggles to get antennas :pain: its all good bro! thank you for showing me where the option was. After clicking a shit tonne of buttons. It ended up being CW 90c FLIP with -45 yaw. Awesome, glad you got it So as a beginner what would you guys recommend Or be a cheap ass like me and run lolipop stubbies for $40. :KEKShibe: HDZero for racing and such, Walksnail for freestyle and such Ok. But like what quad and controller Anything from RadioMaster that you like, with ELRS. some examples are the RadioMaster Boxer, RadioMaster Pocket, Jumper T20S Gemini, whatever bro. we cant tell you what your budget should be. you tell us Is like 700-1000 good yeah. that's digital budget. so what was said above still stands Ok. What are ur quad controller and goggles reccomendations id say 1,000 is about bottom for digital. what type of flying do u wanna do I just gave you. a whole list :loudly_crying_face: radiomaster boxer elrs, walksnail vrx + skyzone cobra x v2, hota d6 pro and crux35 HD How do you bind an ELRS controller with a quad bind button, WiFi or flashing. combining the walksnail vrx with the cobra x would be terrible. the input lag on the cobra's is insane sadly. that's their one drawback"
yea. what goggs then would even fit in that budget?,could totally just fit the goggles x in there oh yea. idk why i thought they were $600 like hdz the moblite is just an example. but easily that + batteries So should I do that quad or the crux 35 whichever you can find and is in stock. the crux35 is a bit hard to find in stock right now Which option do I pick expressLRS. but that's not for walksnail I’m confused. Can u help me find link for crux 35 for walksnail. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I can't find it for Walksnail
Did they even make one?,I feel like I have seen one. but no clue
Any bluejay pros on here? whats reccomended for a 3.5 whoop in regards to PWM 24 khz or 48?,I would set it to 48khz

Should I go for it then? Is that a pretty good price? I lowkey want a mini 3 for the controller with the screen but they are so damn expensive,"I haven't been keeping up with camera drone prices, I can't tell you Wrap a tiny amount of cotton fiber between the prop and shaft. I've also seen people just superglue the prop on"
But as for the listing it says theres 30 day returns and ebay money back guarantee so i should be good right? I have just never bought off ebay. @ExplodingLiPo,"yeah you should be good is there any kind of remover if i superglue them Acetone dissolves cyanoacrylate superglue does gorrila glue fall under that category If it's cyanoacrylate, then yes. If it's polyurethane glue, then absolutely do not use it. Actually if it's anything but cyanoacrylate (CA) don't use it :yellowdudedancing:. im just gonna glue all my props down knowing i can remove them Make 100% sure it's the right one by checking the bottle https://gorillatough.com/product/clear-gorilla-glue-micro-precise/. this it the bottle i have. back of it is just uage and safety instructions Huh. I can't even find a good answer on the SDS. That'll work"
What’s the difference between different apps?,the legit only upgrade from the mini 2 to the mini 3 is the screen and technically its worse and just have the dji ban in mind. if the app gets banned your stuck but if u get normal controller just download litchi or another 3rd party app and your back up and flying True. Appreciate the input ive got a mini 2 and i love it i dont fly it to often tho. ones dji and ones not. litchi can do the tracking on the mini 2 as the stock app cant. uh its got some other neat features. https://flylitchi.com/ I’ll check it out.

"I have a question... it's hard to describe it... I occasionally get short ""turbulence""s in my propellers. I don't know what is causing it, and how to describe it precisely. It's like a propeller would hit an invisible obstacle qnd make a ""woosh"" sound and the whole drone will slightly recoil, just for a second, and then it goes back to normal. Any idea what might it be?",sounds like prop wash. its normal
Could you record it?. Hard to tell without it,"It sounds as if a propeller increased his speed dramatically from the rest, or as if it hit a gas that is more dense than air.  And the drone will slightly recoil. It lasts like for a fraction of a second. We'll need to hear it, that could be a lot of things"
I'm looking for this one. but I couldn't find this item on any website.  maybe cuz i don't know the specific name of it.  anyone who knows?,As a beginner should I get the emax babyhawk II with the DJI goggles integra and a radiomaster boxer  Or  Should I get the Walksnail Avatar goggles X with the radiomaster boxer and some other drone  Or   Do y’all have a better idea

"Hello, I’m trying to waterproof my caddx vista with liquid tape, but idk what tutorial to use because they either tell u to use the vista without or with the case. Can anybody tell me if I should use it with or without the case?","use silicon conformal coating, not liquid tape, and keep the case on, it will just add a bit of durability over decased, and the vtx will overheat slower, especially since you are basically insulating it  from the fresh outside air that is supposed to cool the unit"
I can’t currently get my hands on conformal coating. Also why can’t I just use liquid tape instead?,"just wait until you can get some real conformal coating, it's easier to remove if needed, and i'm pretty sure it's less bad than liquid glue at conducting heat away. so the gyro and esc doesn't self destruct It should have a capacitor connected to it. It protects the quad it basically cuts off the voltage spikes, which makes the electronics not explode as fast I already kinda coated the entire fc and receiver, so….. poor fc. didn't deserve that lol. So should I just remove it, or.. if you try and remove it you risk to remove surface mount components. it's here forever now"
"So it’s waterproof, forever?","so it's taped, forever idk. even a conformal coated fc isn't necessarily water proof"
https://youtu.be/Zgq4y8jV3cA?si=DDxcWhCYx01i7nNL. I used this video,"the ""100% waterproof"" is bullshit, it's only water proof until it isn't anymore, I conformal coated all my fc and aios, and the issue is that well, it's not always that water proof if you didn't do it perfectly Hey guys, after working on my fpga drone for a while and everything works! I’ve burned a motor. :loudly_crying_face: ffs  That’s how my burned motor moves, and idk if it’s about the motor or about the ESC. first when it happened the motor smoked so it’s probably cooked but I’m not sure about it, thanks for any help"
"check the coils, are they blackened?","that's why i'm not sure, theyre perfectly fine. not blackened swap out a different motor to that part of the ESC and see if the problem is there on the good motor"
so to just try another motor on the same esc? ok. that what im trying rn i was hoping to know without trying but ill try and update,You need to have your arm switch on aux 1. If arm isn’t on aux 1 with elrs it won’t work
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) should I put this cap on my fc? Because I’m afraid it might over heat since it’s now “taped”,"it will overheat faster anyway. the cap was most likely a heatsink,  but you isolated the components from it yes i have crossfire. if i go back to betaflight 4.3.2 with the same settings then the drone works correctly does anybody know why my drone might not connect to my controller. this happened to both my whoop and my 5”. i assume it might be a controller thing but i have no clue my drones pitch and yaw are reversed but in betaflight they are normal"
is this a prebuilt or custom?,Well.... yeah. I'm working on it. But the props provide enough thrust for lift off. nothing comes to mind except that it may be a tuning issue
LED_STRIP is for WS2812 addressable LEDs. What LED strip did you buy?,"the Pavo series COB LED strip from betafpv. it's the same that comes hooked up on the pavo 20 by default, but I am trying to get a spare strip working on my pico as well"
"is there a guide as to which resource is linked to which pad?. yes, they said to use LED_STRIP 1 and release its pin port to use the pinio function","The directions describe how to remap a pad (eg LED_STRIP) to PINIO and control the light strip. Yes, do that I did, but with no result sadly. I also tried it with LED on PINIO You can't remap LED. Only LED_STRIP. LED is the status LED on the FC. Set that back to what it was yeah LED didn't work. just disabled the status led. I reset them both to their original pinouts and am just looking for other potential faults. currently have it wired to the pins for ""LED"" according to the site diagram as well, but I did see some posts elsewhere of people having no luck on the pico with LED_STRIP, and having to use other methods. they had the upgraded AIO though, this is the original and it lacks some of the pinouts Show a clear photo of your wiring. And the output of `status` in the Betaflight CLI ```resource LED_STRIP 1 none resource PINIO 1 B06 set pinio_box = 40,255,255,255 save```. Then go to your modes tab in Betaflight and set USER1 to a switch mapped and saved, got the LED strip plugged in, cycling the user1 to switch toggle doesn't seem to do anything. wonder if I have to check these with a meter"
Do you have a battery connected?. Can you post a CLI dump?. Your loop rate settings do not look correct,"I have plugged one in, yeah. usually they work fine just off of the usb connection, but I also have toggled it with the 2s battery plugged in but no luck on it lighting up The 5v pads you have it wired to aren't powered by USB"
They should. Do you have a multimeter?,"I do. I can check the 5v/gnd pins in a bit. and thank you for the assistance, it's appreciated. had a chance to check, there is +5.0VDC at both the solder pad and the connector. so the system would (ideally) work, I just don't know if it's receiving a high/low logic level from the yellow cable. either this is the wrong solder point, or I'm using the wrong resource"

when you have a gps on a quad you can set up gps rescue so the quad flies back when you fly behind something and loose youre connection and you can see youre last position/cordinates on youre goggles/transmitter  but thats when you connect it to the fc. You can send the cordinates back over elrs telemetry but normaly gps has more to do with the fc and the vtx than the elrs receiver. or are you talking about a new product I dont know?,could i fly crux 35 on 2 s idk if i can im mentally retarted
"The video shows perfectly normal behaviour. As for jumping - does it jump and yaw? If so, then ""Motor direction is reversed"" in Motors tab is probably wrong.

"Hello, I recently broke a pin off of my controllers module bay, and when I replaced it now the drone isnt getting inputs from the controller even tho it says that it’s connected.

"Huh? You just put it on and screw it in. if it doesn't fit, you got a prop with the wrong diameter hole","Am I missing a trick here or is there a way to get these props on..... Do i just need to you pure force i am acomplete melt. I got 2mm in stead of 1.5 mm. going  to throw myself off a bridge now. good bye The link says nebula nano. Oh. Yep my bad that doesn't matter, it still goes on the same way also you need to  flip  the prop before mounting it since your quad looks like it's a pusher ye the whole is too big though. Just need to get props with 1.5mm diameter holes dude. how do you want to put a 1.5mm prop hole on a 2mm motor shaft he has some 2mm props on a 1.5mm shaft I understood it the other way you screw them in, it doesn't matter if the hole in the prop is too big ive tried brother i cant. the whole is 2 big but even then, you can just drill them. you screw the prop in, it's not a friction fit. you should have 2 screws to screw the prop on the motor let me try again. nah no screws came with the prop. Just a bit of plastic to put in the center of the prop for it to become a friction fit well you should have some with the motor then. cause that's a T mount prop, so you have to put a screw in the red part to screw in the blue part. the shaft in the middle is kinda useless it's the screws that hold the prop on ah yes cool. I don't think ive got screws for those Well you are going to need some, but the quad should come with screws for the props cheers for that fella! ill try it now ye, sorry looks like i was having a dumb moment :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: No worries, also don't forget to flip the props if it's a pusher or the quad won't fly ye props are upside down. Don't know why on struggling eith this but I am struggling with props... I thought I had it  right first time round leading edge in spin direction didn't work so I swapped them and still not taking off."
Doesn't actually matter. Bi directional dshot just makes the quad fly better. It shouldn't stop it from flying. Did you also check the motor direction ?,"Because the props are reversed, and I think they are upside down, can you take a picture of the prop from the under side and a bit closer so I can check if the writing is on the right side just realised bshot wasnt on eiter :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Switch 1 and 2 then switch 3 and 4 thats how they were first time round. Ill do that again!. :red_heart: ye they spin as per the diragram above Ok, well you just need to switch the props ty btw :slightly_smiling_face: just checking now"
Or is it under ? Cause it needs to be pointing up. Ok,"ye motor direction must be fucked ill go through the wizard. as its still messed up If you can't change the motor direction or motor order (check both) you can also go on esc-configurator.com and try again, the betaflight configurator fails all the time, esc-configurator never fails ye u was right. BF was not saving the changes I made through the wizard. did it through esc config. About to go test. jeesuse whoops are loud :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
what is hd zero and should i get it?. it looks very good,"Yeah, cinewhoops are hardly quiet feels a little more hard to control then my regular 5 inch for some reason. Hdzero is awesomeness distilled into a video system, it's great, basically no latency, you can get the nano90 which feels amazing to fly, great image quality (imo, even if it's controversial), afaik it's basically open source, it's a special video system that isn't at all like walksnail and DJI, but it's a great system, tho I would recommend you try it out in person before buying since its not the same has the classical hd video systems (Also, just my name is very much ironical). Cause smaller props on a heavy quad, you should get used to it at some point ye that was my first ever taste of that. Well thank you for your help sir. Be nice of that motor wizard works al the time :p"
the animal with the edge tx logo that appear when u boot the radio up. replace the sd contents entirely?,"Also, just open it up, unplug everything, re plug everything and see if it fixed the issue instead of flashing stuff I tried syncronising the sd card contents but idk if i did that properly I had this bro when I first got my Radiomaster boxer. After a short while it did just this. The cheap sd card they provide died. I've dealt with the ribbon cables alot, idk where the power button ribbon cable would be. im still using the cheap sd card that came with mine after like 4 years lol mine gave way after 2 months Unplug everything then re plug everything id rather try replacing sd card contents rn as i just put my radio back together from reseating one of the sliders. but I will if sd card doesnt fix it"
Are you failsafing? Or just seeing the rx loss pop up on osd?  I'm just curious. My first elrs whoop was getting rx loss and failsafing like 20 feet away.. The video is humerus,"what is the top speed in each mode on the cetus pro compared to auqilla 16 That antenna is definitely trashed. no idea about the transmitter, but I'Ve seen cases of disconnected antennas in them after a nasty drop Since you've double posted your question, I'll double post my response  I guarantee you will not get definite numbers or comparisons in response to this question. Measuring a quad's top speed, especially a whoop-class quad, is next to a useless metric 200km/h if you go straight down at full throttle, then 0km/h once it exploded after eating the ground"
"Anntena isn’t disconnected but can it be damaged ? It has cover and it was fall from 0,5m","it's a dipole antenna, if it's not litterally cut in half it doesn't really matter"
should you what the antenna of the drone ? and what do you call a path antenna ? it's just a linear antenna,This battery just started smoking what the duck. Like in the thing. Not by itself
"In order to get a good answer to your question, you need to understand how antennas radiate signal. Omnidirectional antennas' pattern is typically a ""donut"" (exact size and shape depends on the antenna), where it picks up or radiates signal in a wide circle, but also has areas where it does not output signal (called antenna ""nulls). Directional antennas typically have a pattern that projects predominantly in a single direction (hence the moniker). For best reception between two antennas, one transmitting and one receiving, you want their radiation patterns to overlap as much as possible. That means oriented the same way and pointed ""at"" each other. Since we universally use omnidirectional antennas on aircraft, best reception with the receiving antenna is when the drone is A) oriented in the same manner and B) broadcasting from inside the receiving antenna's pattern. In order to get best signal with a directional antenna, yes, it needs to be ""aimed"" where you are flying. Make sense @MadMax?","I know that. But idk if controller anntena is directional or omidirectional/isotropic it's a dipole omni. with the nulls at the pointy bits. and an isotropic antenna is a theoratical antenna, (btw dbi means db over isotropic), no antenna can have a perfectly round emission pattern"
So I got a replacement ufl to rpsma but it’s longer then the old one. Can I just cut and resolder it?,it's not very easy to splice coax
Oh okay thanks. Also how do you get a ufl connecter do plug in ?,Line it up very carefully. Takes a bit of force I might be a moron but we’ll I’m lining it up then pushing but it’s not moving. they click together like legos Because I might need to use pliers or smh.. I’m pressing and I’m sure they’re lined up.
"Oh , okey , but can this anntena inside this cover can be damaged because of 1/2m drop ?","Probably not, but also, it's ELRS and it's a dipole, you could chop it up with a knife and it should still perform fine. Like the crossfire antennas usually got chopped and people just left them on regardless"
This plastic a bit poped out after dron and i just clicked it back. Oh okey. So its probably spi reciever anntena fault ?. This shorter ELRS signal range,"This isn't a big damage Like , this gold thing what should be anntena is a bit chooped Check the output power and set it to 200ms if it's at 25mw. Yeah I know, but it isn't that much damage im trying to figure out the pwm of my esc. i have the TAKER G4 35A AIO for stability and ESC protection. i know its got to be either 24k or 48k"
"what props are recommended for 5"" freestyle quad?","there's no recommended. you buy a bunch and see what you like I haven't flown a 5"" in like 4-5 years. lol"
are u flying smaller ones?,people like the ethix props. I don't really like ethix I like the v2s and the j40. And the hq 4 play. But just buy a bunch and see what you like
It says blue jay 48khz is this the same as pmw which is k?,"It is not a setting you change in the configurator, it is part of the firmware you flash to it. If it isn't listed in the header or title somewhere, then you just need to remember it Yes that is the PWM frequency you flashed"
Does the dji integra work with normal fpv's?,"The DJI Integra are only compatible with the DJI air units.They do not support analog FPV. But I can use the air unit with non dji drones right Air units can be installed in pretty much anything, yea Thanks mate :thumbs_up:"
"Hi, could someone tell me which walksnail vtx would be the best for Longrange flying?. I maybe want to switch from Caddx vista/ analog to walksnail.",Whichever really. The Moonlight is just the V2 VTX with a DVR board
Plenty people do that or plenty people think it's dumb?:grinning_face_with_sweat:,"Yo does anyone really use an elrs module for the boxer or is that dumb Plenty people do that if/when they need it If plenty do use it, what would it be for since there's already a 1W elrs module in there Gemini. They use it for Gemini/higher output/they have a 4in1 boxer What does Gemini do again two transmitters two receivers. one package Will thag give an increased range I have the happymodal dual tcxo, do you think it's wise to get gemini"
"It's diversity so you can have better antenna placement, technically they could achieve higher speeds (but they haven't), it's far more reliable. list goes on. If you want to? sure. but you don't need it",Ah all good then thanks
Is the DJI controller 3 good for selfbuilds?. Or should I just buy a normal radio?,"should just buy a normal radio. RadioMaster Boxer, Jumper T20S, RadioMaster Pocket. anything that comes with ELRS"
But why?. Like I already have a controller 3,range and reliability
Would you say this orientation is any good?,"If you arrange your antenna like this it will help avoid antenna null zone.. Which is as the aircraft banks the antenna orientation becomes weakest Not really because they are both laid horizontally, so having two isn't giving any benifit.. One should be horizontal and one vertical to cover the 3 dimensions of antenna orientation Most people I've seen online do this layout. But it makes sense what your saying so I'll try find a spot to mount vertically most people have orientated their antennas wrong then. Its like bnf quads keep coming with slanted gps units even though they shouldn't Should I just wedge the antenna vertical through there. Honestly have no clue where to put it since it will be close to the props it'll be ok if its secured in there, wont be in any more danger than those vtx antenna"
Oh is that a bad spot too lol. Is this better than before? There's one antenna still on the arm and I just managed to put another one sticking slightly out the top and there's a bit more antenna poking out the bottom,"So, the reason why we put them on the arms is simply so it doesn't get either obstructed by the frame or get hit by the props, so having both on the arms is actually perfectly fine, sure having them at 90° in 3d is ideal, but if you just do freestyle it doesn't matter that much since elrs has such good range already"
Should I change them back then? Or is this kinda better. ITS bending the cable weirdly though,"I would just put the zipties like that so the antenna isn't flopping around It's not going to be good to have it poking out like that when you land Both will give about the same range. Don't worry too much about it honestly Ah yeah I don't think I can place it anywhere else. Alr and thanks, imma put zipties in an x Antenna placement is fine so long as it's not completely stupid (like buried inside the carbon frame) especially with the range of our modern systems. It's only worth looking at the absolute best antenna placements possible if you do lr, for freestyle it doesn't matter nearly as much will the amount of cells in a battery effect goggle performance No, but it will affect all the other parts of your quad how will it affect the quad. thinking of pairing a crux35 with a 4s Well it's made for 4s true, idk why i thought that was its limit or something Say you try and put 6s on your crux35, then it will catch on fire, if you try and put 2s, it will be extremely under powered do you know how many cells or volts the walksnail x goggles take. could be blind but i cant find anything on their site unless its got a built in battery yeah i was just blind"
so i will get the same performance out of them even if its 7 or 26v?,"Personally I would just use a 2s li-ion pack i have a flat 4s 21700 pack The goggles itself actually runs on a much lower voltage (5v or 3.3v and lower inside the chips sometimes) the 7-26v is the voltage range of the BEC that will transform the vcc voltage into the 5v the goggles need, so if you plug in 7v or 26v the goggles will get 5v anyway never have to charge it, fits in any pocket when you have them @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) do you think this is okay vtx antenna placement I absolutely hate the floppy antennas but outside of that it's fine Yes me too but I literally can't fit anything else Ufl->sma pigtail and you put some hard sma antennas on thinking of using a 20,000mah power bank i have, not sure how many watts it needs but the power bank can output 9v and 2.22a or 12v and 1.5a (22.5w) It will require a new print and new antennas are tho. Then just use it at 9v and it will be fine I've thought about that but I don't think there's any space and I have to use both the au connectors so that's two antennas which would take up soo much space"
"Hello everyone, I've got a succx iflight f4 micro, and I'm. Trying to install an elrs nano module, I'm facing hell soldering to the board without shortening the VC and ground and the Rx and tx... Any idea to.help? It's toooooo small I barely even see the pad gaps","hopefully the powerbank figures it out, as far as i know i cant set what it outputs. probably just gonna see if it works and buy a bettery if it doesnt I mean, 2 sma pigtails don't take up that much more space, you just have to line them up horizontally I'd need to find an antenna mount for this quad that also supports gps which is kinda hard"
It should work since it outputs either 9v or 12v and both are within the voltage limits of the goggle's bec. Make it yourself ?. It's not that hard,I don't have a 3d printer tho If you ask nicely most fpv shops will print it for you
Oh fr?. I might as well try then,"Most of them have a 3d printed section with stuff they 3d print themselves Should I like base it off the normal mount and then modify it The normal mark5 mount isn't made at all for a pigtail. So no Ah alright. Other than that, is the length for the antennas good enough So long as it isn't getting blocked by the battery and frame you guys think dual antennas on a crux35 is gonna make a big difference (walksnail). thinking of getting a dual antenna vtx just to save money but id need a custom mount for it. also hoping to fly long range Just use single antenna, dual antenna is only kinda useful in environments with a lot of multipathing and reflections my receiver , receiver mode in betaflight keeps reseting to something i dont want even if i do save Oh yeah would this apply to the dji au or would you need to use both antenna slots Basically, if you don't put an antenna on a transmitter you will toast the transmitter get the dual vtx and put a single antenna on it So no, you have to use all the antenna slots if you want a working vtx was thinking of that but didnt know if it would cause issues :gifKingLaughing: Do you freestyle @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) well you need a special dual antenna. one with two inputd"
Do you use any dji air units?,Even if lately I didn't do much before I fucked up all my quads
so like 1 antenna that plugs in to both ports?,"(Fuck DJI, they can rot in hell) No, I don't use DJI, I currently use analog and soon enough hdzero too but I will keep some analog quads because analog is simply superior for tinywhoops Lmaoo what's the hate with dji"
know any off the top of your head or terms to look up to find one?,"I have a nice paragraphs about it. so, fuck dji cause it's a big company that doesn't give a flying fuck about fpv and basically gives us some crumbs so the DJI folks are happy, For being an anti community enterprise with predatory business practice (like when they ""allegedly"" cut a deal to manufacturers like GEPRC if they didn't include walksnail and hdzero quads)  they also had several instances of crappy work ethics, such has underpaying the factory workers (but that's more a china issue) For really like the CCP and selling them surveillance hardware tailor made to their specification so they can track people more easily, and they also had having Human rights researchers and activists slapping them on the wrist for supplying the Chinese government with the technology to target and incriminate Uyghurs And For for sending all your data to the CCP also, for their proprietary B.S and compatibility B.S for making drones with cheap hollow plastic frames so they break and you have to send it back and pay ""only"" 50 bucks and wait ""only"" 5 days cause the thing is so fragile, if you look at it wrong an arm breaks (the people being like ""I clipped a branch and it didn't self destruct, dji is so durable"" is a proof of it when you compare it to the durability of carbon frames also, even if less people see it as a real issue like me, the existance and how they advertise their fpv drones, saying it's ""the world fastest drone"" or whatever other bullshit, it just gets under my skin, and I also know quite a few people who bought an avata, and were dissapointed within days of the limited capabilities and left fpv cause they already spent 1200 bucks on a love toy controller and an underpowered and incredibly noisy cinewhoop, but again less people see this as a flaw from dji since it filters out the crappy people and it is also not bad at hovering and going at slow speed (even if angle mode exists, and it does the same fricking thing)  here you go. I also probably forgot that they basically benefit from slavery since the CCP benefits from it and the CCP subsidizes dji"
[this](https://pyrodrone.com/products/flyfishrc-dual-band-5-8ghz-2-4ghz-antenna-for-dji-o3-u-fl-lhcp-red-choose-length?_pos=1&_sid=a0f6e9d84&_ss=r) look good?,Dji does sound kinda shitty after that lol a store called [iflight](https://shop.iflight.com/DJI-O3-Air-Unit-Antenna-Pro1905) has the offical one but ive never heard of the store
You never heard of iflight ?. Seriously?,"I'd get these but I'm running lhs polarisation yeah all i know of is pyro, rdq, and r##or r##t :nauseated_face: And that's linear, so you will only get 70% of the range you would with some correctly polarized antennas Hence why I have two antennas lol Iflight is basically the biggest bnf manufacturer"
Not what I said. Do you mean GEPRC ?,"well the iflight one is polarized They have some good stuff, but they also have some really crappy stuff like their electronics It's *dual* polarized, one half is lhcp other is rhcp. The flyfishrc is the same (iirc) Is there any double ufl antennas that are only lhcp or will it always be linear I believe the reason is just to have better performance in places with lots of reflection and it also makes the antennas interact less together so they don't create noise on one another. Not that I know of, afaik they only made dual polarized antennas double ufl antennas for the o3. But I might be wrong on this one @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) do i want LHCP or RHCP Doesn't matter. It just needs to be matched on all your antennas. Or else you will get exactly 75cm of range before loosing video. (rhcp and lhcp have been created to not interact with each other, so if you send some lhcp rf an rhcp antenna won't pick it up) i think walksnail is LHCP by default"
Do u have dji goggles?,"saw the patch antennas show up while looking. no, plan on buying a crux35, walksnail x, and shoving a walksnail transmitter in the crux Yes I'm pretty sure walksnail is LHCP. Best to buy that polarisation then probably going to just get the single antenna vtx. i cant find the right antenna for the dual one wait if i use a usb c and plug it into the charging port on the pocket. do i need batterys or can i just power it using the charging port fuck me. dude. there are no stores. where i am from. that sell 18650 batterys"
outback is like. 99% of your country bruh. that doesn't narrow it down. no vape shops?. no anything?. your fpv shops will also just have 18650's,oh. vape shops. hmm. 12 hour drive. ongod far. i live far above melbourne
how?. ive never seen nor heard of it working,"you ***can*** power it via usb c but its really just better to get batteries. id only use the usb c port for power temporarily. also not sure if transmitting will work i only ever used usb for power when flying sim hold the power button with usb connected, go in to betaflight, and exit dfu. then the radio will turn on and be powered off usb"
OMG SO I DONT NEED BATTERYS ?,"Yo should I purchase the gp hero 12 for fpv what drone u tryna fly it on A 5 inch freestyle. Or do you want the model thats good. uh why do u think u need a gopro I wanna get better footage for nice cool flying clips lol then sure. if u got the money already Should I wait for the gp hero 13, apparently it's launching this september consider the DJI action camera and the Insta360 Ace Pro, they're generally more reliable and I think they look better. very opinionated though. but for most O3/Moonlight is fine enough footage too I do have an o3. But I'll think about it"
Wasn't the DJI cam prone to overheating or did they fix that?,Yeah I just read about that but like what's popular for actioncams on fpv rn Yes but is that all there really is
can you take a photo?,"Sorry im new idk what spi means theres like 3 types of receiver for drones, spi, SBUS and uart serial.  So I'm trying to work out which one yours is. can you go into voice 2 and ill stream it. @RCEnjoyer"
?. SBUS is also over UART,"I'm pretty sure he has a uart serial reciever that connects to the tx and rx pads and doesn't realise it.. Since there's not too many ELRS SPI boards and they don't make SBUS ELRS RX for drones. all ELRS RX's can be switched to SBUS I think hey. someone help this guy im too dumb I doubt he's got some kind of unique ELRS SBUS configuration going on with a bind and fly drone.. They probably are confused and think ""Uart serial"" is the name of the radio protocol oh no I just bet his Betaflight is configured as not-SPI while it is. It'd be great if they y'know, tell us what they have and show images if he tells us what he has and shows images https://tenor.com/view/waiting-waiting-patiently-waiting-for-you-waiting-on-you-gif-15489516379864441176. Waiting for images. Or even the name of the drone it is metear 75. pro. literadio 2 se. and idk One sec. ill give you a photo that uses serial elrs but he cant select elrs. idk. in betaflight. its retarted why did you change it at all anyways you select Serial and then CSRF You don't select ELRS in BF. You select serial rx un the ports and CSRF its on that but it will not bind literadio :JBYikes:  I kinda low key hate these ELRS radios that don't have a screen and can't run the lua, i know but its cheap and affordable. so ifykyk ik. thats why i told him. to try and get pocket I got the pocket, pretty decent for a grab and go radio. I use it for everything I don't need a ton of switches for ill try to figure this one and if it dosent work then ill buy the pocket"
See if it had a screen with the lua you'd go into the lua script on the radio and then press the bind button. With the literadio I have no idea.. Does it have a bind button?,u press a small button on the back. yes
Ok so is the quads rx in bind mode?,the literadio is awful in every way it wont go into bind mode Power cycle the quad 3 times to enter bind mode he does the plug unplug methoed we did that and then pushed the bind button
Does the elrsrx have a bind phrase?,i orignally did that. and flashed it using a tutorial. but i cant get the webui. anymore
Does it still broadcast the wifi SSID?,it dosent show any wifi network at all
"Ok, it may be that the wifi mode interval setting was set to something very long by accident. Sometimes it defaults to a minute. So have you tried plugging the quad in and waiting a while?",After a minute or two it should start rapid flashing and it's in wifi mode. Yeah for some reason a lot of the new firmware sets wifi mode to activate after 1 minute when before it was 30 seconds. It's made me think it was broken when I first experienced it. i swear its going to be the longest minute its not really doing anything and no wifi server is showing up yo. i know how fix. throw out literadio. and get pocket. and idk about drone
how is the led on the receiver acting?,flashing blue steady orange and a green every so often. the green flashes for like a milisecond if his receiver wont broadcast an ssid then there's an issue with it it was working originally. im going to call it quits for today and comeback tomorrow if have school. thanks for the help
Wait are we sure its not spi?,he got it for his birthday. so its not spi. atleast i think idk hes offline but i think it did. the lil cube antenna that's the spi antenna
is the TYRP drone sim any good?,eeeeh. u should get veloci drone if u wanna race. i mean u can do freestyle but its limited
What do most people who train freestyle use?,uhhh. i think uncrashed is good. veloci drone i freestyle in
"Hi , can i flash my controller from LBT to FCC version in EU ? Will i need somehow flash my drones to FCC too ? because of flashing my controller to FCC ?. Also after flashing it will my all settings in the radio reset to the default?","You will also need to flash any receivers you have, with exceptions to SPI recivers.. Likely the lua setting may change, but any channel mixes or switches will remain the same."
So i don’t need to flash spi yeah ?. And this 150mw more will give better signal range ?,It will need to be the same elrs version. But I believe it will work regardless if its fcc or lbt. Or atleast mine did
"Not sure, I can't imagine there being much if any change. However fcc does unrestrit the output power which will give you more range.. Not that im aware of. Assuming you meant 'will someone know im using fcc instead of lbt?'","Nah , I mean will someone chceck me that i’m using fcc Probably not no.. The majority of people in Europe use fcc anyway"
How **thicc** is the wall?,"2 x 120m2 houses. :grinning_face_with_sweat: So not a wall, but a house or 2. More output will help This range at 0.5m height. Or shorter height. I like cutting grass with my quad That is quite a bit of obstruction. Flash fcc, you can always go back to lbt"
But idk why I have still analog signal (I have cobra x’s) but I’m getting sometimes rxloss (radiomaster pocket 100mw). Is that normal in spi reciver’s that my analog signal have better penetration than elrs signal ?,Your anolog is 4x stronger tho
Emmm. Rlly ?. Elrs is 2.4gh. So it has longer range. So i need to flash it yeah ? Can you help me a bit ?,"I’ll send u pic and just tell me what squares i need to choose You flash it as normal, just click fcc instead of lbt. Theres plenty of videos on youtube"
That is tiny compared to mx soldering Iron. The dc or barrel jack is for powering it? Ye,The pinecil is crazy small wow I have a lot better penetration. I was getting there rxloss. Now I’m having all 5 stripes
And 97% signal. Lol. Soo. Should i stay with this fcc or change it to lbt. I have a lot better signal with fcc. But. Will this more power do something with lbt electronics ?,Lbt limits you to 100mw
Will it interfere. ?. With lbt electronics. ?,"Doesn't work like that Then why Eu did limit do 100mw Lbt and fcc is just some software limits, it's not ""lbt electronics"" or ""fcc electronics"" the difference is just some legal bullshit Because of some laws that nobody enforce, also called *some guys though 25mw was enough for you so fuck you do as they say*. So just use fcc. And blast 20w of rf, nobody actually cares mmm.... 1w elrs my favorite 2.5w analog (one day 10w) Infinite. Until it's not anymore https://www.fpvfaster.com.au/collections/drones/products/newbeedrone-mosquito-blv3-micro-fpv-drone-bnf-frsky is this any good Emm. Its 6g and you can plug 2s battery uh. so. im retarted u see My frame to my 2s quad weight 6g :JBYikes:. Idk it has 20000kv it weight 6g and you can use 2s. Idk if thats true but if it is , then its demon well to start it’s frsky so not rlly it looks rlly good. i mean i got elrs but. if i could. i would If you want an open prop 1s 75mm look at the flywoo nano baby fr16 well i was originally getting mobula so i can just put it on the bassline frame The aio can handle 2s, but the quad is designed around 1s Just get the bassline, the mob8 tune is very specific and it will fly like crap on a carbon frame 65mm and I used to have an 85mm and cant i just get a bassline tune like. im new to this so cant i just download a basslien tune Buy Hapoymodel bassline Just get the bassline I can send you my tune i dont really wanna cause i do wanna do some indoors You aren't going to do indoors with a mob8 i have a massive hours. house Me too, and the mob8 is still over powered for that well cant i limit the motors If you want to do indoors look at a 65-75mm 1s. Then it will fly like shit and won't be able to corner anymore I’m flying bassline indoors I mean u can also buy mob8 the swap the frame If you want to do indoors and outdoors get a 75mm 1s, if you want to do outdoors exclusively in your back yard get a 2"" 2s like the bassline, if you want to do indoors exclusively get a 65mm 1s"
Between bassline and mob ?,"It's not, a bassline and a mob 8 cost the same no i got a mob 8 on sale It's the same quad with a different time and frame Make Bassline from mob Yeah I don't know how much a kangaroo dollars is worth, I only trade in real money So it's just the normal price for a mob8 why cant i just do this. and download bassline tune I can even send you my tune. For bassline. Its perfect oh yes please. feed me I said just get a bassline since you didn't say there was a sale on one of them But you need to flash esc with bluejay should have. ok. i dunno hwo do that but will figure out But also, a bassline is really not made for indoors, if you crash your furniture won't be happy. The x12 uses bluejay out of the box on the mob8 too Bassline out of the box is blheli Well mob8 uses bluejay already what the hell. ur confusign me Basically bluejay 48kz is better and you have to use it if you want to have the most performance and flight time out of your micros. Oh ok Try to turn on rmp filtering in betaflight if you can’t you have blheli you can you have bluejay. If you have Blheli flash Esc with bluejay 48K i dotn got a quad yet Oh. So order it. And buy frame for bassline. To swap it yes. ik. my friend did it You can turn on rpm filtering in both cases, just with one the quad will get all funky and might go full throttle before arming and with the other it won't. So don't. I believe on esc-configurator.com they tell you which firmware you have Oh so it was probably with omidirectional something in motor tab There is nothing about omnidirectional in the motor tab There is. Because you can’t apply it or just your motors won’t work after applying it. Or the easiest way is to check it in the esc config. If you have bluejay or blheli Then show me the omnidirectional thing in the motor tab If you are talking about Bi directional dshot, it can make the motors ramp up without arming even with props on so again don't do that Sorry its bi directiona. Forget about it. If he will have blheli motors won’t work. But as i said the easiest way is to chceck it in each config Again, if the firmware doesn't support it the motors can go funky and ramp up before arming, so don't recommend that as a way to check the firmware. I don't really want someone to lose a finger Then I term windup will make the motors go up anyway Always after tuning quad. Nevermind just check it in esc config"
Does walksnail moonlight have D-Log M?,"@timtomtimmytom Here’s my tuning. Also Esc config @timtomtimmytom No. You get res/fps options and a bitrate option, that's about it"
Like conformal coating?,Ye so its a little waterproof
I'm not sure what specific brand to recommend.. Do you intend to submerge the quad or fly in the rain or?,"I like MGchemicals 422c silicone conformal. Water resistance is only as good as you coat the board, water ""proof"" is impossible (just to make sure you understand what to expect) No but I wanna go on the safe side and in case i crash in water. Or when filming cars after rainy days I dont want my quad to explode because of some splash of water Can someone explain the difference between motors up vs down. And the benefit and drawback for each respective orientation. Most ci whoops have downwards mounted and claim it gives more stability and efficiency yet lr builds do not."
I think upwards is easier to fix but a bit less stable and slighty less efficient and downwards is more stable and for  cinewhoops?,"props down mean the arms arent in the air flow, which is good for cinewhoops. But props down had disadvantage of your props and motors getting damaged unless the frame is designed for it. Ive never seen a frame designed for LR that uses props down"
@RCEnjoyer do u coat your drone to make it a bit waterproof?,Never bothered but I don't fly around water I wanna do it because after I saw a guy flying the drone and the car splashed a bit water and the drone got hit just a little bit it went boom makes sense if you're flying  somewhere you will get splashed. for rain or the occasional puddle I've not needed any coating though.
whats flying indoor mode?,low rates. for my 2.5 inch cinelog
One quick question does the foxeer razer mini fit in the spafly syncmode ?. https://supaflyfpv.com/product/syncmode/ https://droneshop.nl/foxeer-razer-mini. Here you have the links to both websites,"I think it should, yea"
"Hey guys I am coming to India in a few days and I have a toy drone (""E88 pro"" type this in google to see the drone) which I bought for around 1600 rupees.

I am just wondering if the customs will charge me for bringing this drone to India or ask me to pay any duty for it. The drone has a camera but it is not that high clarity. So can I just put this drone in my check-in baggage and carry the battery in my hand bag and I will be good to go? Please reply fast","i travel with fpv all the time and never had any trouble, even in strict counties like vietnam. i would take propellers off and have battery in safe storgage mode. you can also buy battery bag that helps incase of fire. i just looked drone up youll be fine. you probably dont even need to take props off. you can put everything in your carry on bag. i never check any drone stuff ever"
thank you so much bud. they won't ask for any duty right?,"they didnt ask me when i went to thailand. when i landed i went through the ""claim nothing"" line hmm ok. hope i go thru without any issue you might get asked about batteries though"
like where did it come from?,"no they asked me what they are for, just tell them drone they dont care"
wait. how did u know?,"haha was random guess. ive seem some fpv guys that live in kerala, looks really nice"
thanks dude. its my home. where r u from?,damn bro. happy to hear i want to go to kerala tho its an awesome place. should check this place out yeah hopefully one day in Kerala the customs are actually pretty chill. it is not compulsory for all people to go thru customs checking. and there is no security check after you land here. only some suspicious people get stopped just restore the backup you made before applying the preset Because it likely has a pretty poor analog output and bad latency
Guys how to secure this anntena ?. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) I replaced the anntena :skull:,"I was about to say that Like you are going to notice less than a gram on a 2"" 2s Idk still 1g. I will drill a hole in the canopy You are not going to feel it on a quad that is like over 40g Or get some silicone glue Quad is 36g. :Harold: Rounded it gets to 40g 1g is perhaps noticeable on an ultra light 65mm tinywhoop, not a 2"" 2s. If you actually cared about weights you wouldn't be flying 1103 on 2"" I’m that type of guy what is cutting frames , using nylon screws , and drilling holes in the canopy to reduce every gram. I won’t find more powerfull motors than 1103 with this weight. Yeh 1103 from beta are lighter but less power 1103 is useless on 2"", 1102 is the sweet spot, and you can even get very good flight performance on 1002 with bi blades, so my point still stands that if you really cared about weights you wouldn't fly 1103 2"""
Aren’t 1102 like 14000kv + ?. They are probably for 1s quads,"No... The size of the motor is pretty irrelevant to the kv. 1102 is perfectly suitable for 2"" 2s Depends, some people like 10000kv, others like up to 19000kv on some 1002 2"" bi blades,  https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/moteur-vci-spark-1102-13000kv-2pcs-vci-12866.html for exemple, just to show there are other motor manufacturers than betafpv and that 1102 2s 2"" is not dead The flight time will be shorter. I like my 10minutes. Or 6"
"And ? I didn't talk about flight time, only performance","And flight time won't necessarily be shorter k. ima order them. Will see If you are building a toothpick you could go down to 1002. Some people even fly 2"" 1s toothpicks on 0802 Im squeezing 25A idk if they’ll survive The point of a toothpick is to use smaller motors with lower pitch props. The 2023-3 you are using aren't going to be suitable on 1002 for sure"
anybody got a tutorial for how to connect my boxer to my drone?,"But some GF 2015-2 or 2008-2 would work on 1002 Find joshua bardwell elrs tuteoial You go on the ELRS website and search I did, and it shows on how to reflash A real toothpick uses bi blades and tiny motors"
should the ports tab is betaflight be empty after a change and reboot?,It will reset if you entered in an invalid combination
can I get an example? like I just turn on the UARTS and change them to what they are supposed to be. like serial RX vtx and gps. even just serial RX it resets,"yeah, but I don't understand what you mean by ""turning on a UART"""
"flicking this. wait, was I not supposed to turn this on?. omg","it's not a toggle to turn the UART ""on"" or ""off"" it's an actual setting that conflicts with most other configurations they should just. name it MSP. so that people who don't know what it is don't touch it ok another quick question. how to I get my controller to connect to betaflight and the drone. I reflashed LUA and the firmware I mean... it is named Configuration/MSP. which is what it's used for. idk My OSD is not correctly scaled in my goggles 2 it sits at the top right occupying only 1/4 of the screen can I adjust scaling somehow. (I applied the correct osd profile)"
mess with the video format tab in BF. hit save and see if it worked. what kind of vtx?,dji o3. I can't the other options are greyed out. yes i did that
"quick question, when I press ""motor direction"" and then change one of them, why does it not save?. cuz my 4 and 1 motors are not spinning the right way",i recommend you just use the esc config. and flash the esc while you're at it esc-configurator.com on a chromium browser. can just reverse them on there
"I solved it by turning on normal canvas in the goggles instead of hd. My ESC voltage is reported wrong, it says 17.8V instead it should be 25V as my charger is showing. However I can't calibrate the ESC voltage and if I try and use ADC voltage it just reports 0V.. could it be that the baud rate is wrong?",Somehow destroyed ESC firmware. It won’t let me flash new blheli to it becuase of “maintenance” on the application. ESC config online won’t read my ESC. I downloaded blue jay config not that failed to flash BLHeli_32 is down completely. and will likely be for a while. Bluejay is only for 8bit ESCs
ok i have 32bit. is there anything i can do?,"flash AM32, but that would require some difficult soldering"
damn so theres no way to recover this esc?,well... you can just flash AM32 to it and be good
cant i just flash an older version on blheli?. soldering?,blheli32 is gone. the company fucked us all over and left. <https://oscarliang.com/flash-am32-blheli32-esc/>. here's a guide
they didnt leave a file or anything? haha i dont know anything about firmware. thanks,"you need a special little board to do it, like an stlink. but they're like 10 bucks or so on Amazon jeez thats annoying. i wonder why esc config wouldnt read the esc but blhelisuite32 did. i really want to try and figure out how to flash older blheli its got to be possible esc-configurator is only for am32, blheli_s and bluejay. blheli32 is proprietary and needs their own program. it's protected in all kinds of ways, so you can only use their stuff"
quick question. why can't I see the OSD tab in betaflight?,did you enable the OSD. on the configuration tab thank you very much my kind sir
Is there a difference between blhelisuite and blheli32?,"BLHeli Suite is the configuration program, BLHeli_32 is the ESC firmware. just like Betaflight Configurator and Betaflight I checked baud rates and it doesn’t change anything. How can it be that my ESC shows the wrong voltage. I don’t have a multimeter but my charger clearly shows 25V whereas bf shows 17.5V. I reflashed the FC and now it shows the correct voltage with onboard ADC but after I apply my backup again it gets messed up."
does the crux35 have built in GPS?,"Also, there's BlHeliSuite16 (for BLHeli_S escs) and BlHeliSuite32 (for BLHeli_32).. The suite will allow you to flash an older version, typically I'm looking for the DJI fly app in my google play store but i can't find it. I have a samsung a 33. Nvm I downloaded it from google"
wth is INVALID. that's new. Would you happen to have a windows PC on hand?. And could you try it with the windows version of BLHeliSuite32?. I know that the Mac version is problematic. @miketyson,i dont have a windows handy at the moment. Just tried this one didn’t work That one can't work because it's not for BLheli_32. BLHeli_32 is completely proprietary so it needs that proprietary suite
ok so you think my best bet is to try windows?,"I read that the INVALID thing may be caused by Mac OS SSL library incompatibility, but it's hard to say. I was trying to update it or something because it was non stop beeping. I didn’t know blheli was down. ESC config online couldn’t read any of the ESC and it wouldn’t let me flash anything in blheli suite because of “maintenance”. So then I downloaded bluejay config and tried to flash that but didn’t realize the ESC has to be 8bit instead of mine which is 32bit.. I’m not sure why two ESC are invalid and two are unckown"
"> because it was non stop beeping if the FC tells it to beep, it will beep. Did you investigate the FC first?","Yeah I had a couple flags. But it was both my esc beeping and beeper It's pretty common for people to put the Beeper mode on the middle position. which makes it beep on powerup Yeah I messed with the switch it didn’t stop and if dshot beacon is enabled, the motors will be used for beeping. also, there is a configurable timeout after which the ESC will start beeping on its own, if left idle. anyway. Right now that ESC is in a semi-bricked state. You can try to reflash it.... but it's a pretty oof situation I’m down. Worst comes to worst I have to do am32 If it's supported by AM32 and you're good with the bootloader flashing shenanigans.... BLHeli_32 as a project is now completely dead anyway. anyway I gtg to bed This message pops up every time I go to flash Ahhhh f*. yeah that's RIP then. That server is never going back up. I suspect time to buy the :sparkles: ST-Link :sparkles: The BLHeli_32 company had to shut the whole thing down because of EU laws about preventing wartime use So lame! Sucks I can’t even flash the last update didn't expect them to shut down even the auth servers. that sucks"
You don’t think it will ever come back?,unlikely. but what do I know
probably wont work on windows?,"If this is the error, then I wouldn't expect it to.. I mean, you can try. in case it's some mac weirdness. but considering the news and the error you got, I am skeptical makes sense, thank you"
Does anyone know how to make a drone able to lift more weight and be able to fly for longer?,"Light build, powerful motors, high mah battery. And not flying crazy freestyle Nah I won't be it's for a drone that can deliver stuff."
"I need some help, i have a radiomaster pocket with a cc2500 chip and thus also multiprotocol, i have it bound to a frsky xm+ reciever (yes i know frsky sucks) But each time it connects it quickly loses connection and often doesnt regain it. How do i fix this. Like, do i need a new reciever and if so which ones would work?. Or is it simply constant interferance","Yo does anyone put a protective cover on their go pro while freestyling I just use a regular TPU mount/case. protects it well enough how much can a 6s fpv drone lift like a average drone or yours Rough guess around 2-4kg. They might be able to lift more, but your throttle would be rather high and wouldn't be viable How heavy should a 5"" be with a go pro Mine is exactly 500g dry weight, 840g ish with battery and GoPro"
does anyone know why I cant flash?,because you need. stm32 dfu drivers :sparkles:
from this website https://zadig.akeo.ie/ ?,"NO. NO. you will fuck up all your shit. never use that garbage It's on the main page of Betaflight before you connect, all the links. you can probably also use the impulserc driver fixer but why is that garbage there. that zidag <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe>. because Betaflight isn't so friendly. Zadig can be used in certain cases. not all Zadig is not for the uninitiated. It's a cult. Black magic. Zadig is a driver grimoire @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) my quad doesnt detect anything anymore lol. its broken Looks like you would want to increase your anti-gravity gain a bit what fc in it and are you flashing the correct target"
how much ? should i increase it ?,"Hard to say. Probably not a lot. If you're still at the default of 8.0, I'd go to 8.5 and see if that helps It was the correct one. The one for skystars Wait lemme get the link. https://www.rotorama.de/product/skystars-h7-dual-gyro-km60-bl32"
What's an appropriate voltage to stop flying my 4s 850mah battery?,"https://googlethatforyou.com/ Lol. Wasn't **that** bad if a question 4.2 volts. idk if tahts true. i just googled that shit Dawg. Ik that. I'm asking about when I'm flying, what voltage should I ***stop*** flying jt at"
I abuse my 1s batteries but I figure I shouldn't for these bigger batteries. Is that ChatGPT?,no. so u land at 14v i guess. idrk
"I want to create a DIY drone and I would like to integrate a radar, is it useful or not?",what u gonna do with it just a homemade radar. drone yeah but what use case i mean i wouldnt. but if u do on the screenshot i replied to because i want to make video in mountains and my latest drone crashed there so if i get a radar it wont crash  i gues
u mean gps?. yes get them if u go far and shit,no its to inacurate and sensors too
this?. do I need to enable anything else?,"no, are you sure you flashed it correctly"
Did it give you a pop-up once you connected?,yes. wait lemme flash again. ill show. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) yeah the target is fine
what else could be the problem?. did i brick it?,"Most FC s cannot be bricked. Unless you smash them with a brick, the absolutely essential code is locked and cannot be accessed @Swirf it fr doesnt detect anything anymore There is a bootloader you can try. STM32 bootloader or something. Also try inav and follow the guide they have to recover FCs the FC is fine :loudly_crying_face:. can you do a `dump all` in the CLI and give it to us Okay ill do when I get back. I am not at home now"
"Guys my camera in fractal 75 keeps moving ever so slightly, not only changing up and down angle but to sides too. Its a pico in stock tpu mount. Any suggestions how to make it more secure? Im lookint at available files for prints with not much luck, all decent canopys are top mounted not front. I tried new tpu print just in case old one streched a bit and its same. Hot glue the thing in place?",Hot glue. Its why I tend to not use the fractal cam mount on my fractal builds
are there any goggles at a similar price to a skyzone cobra x v4 but smaller?,"Lowkey feeling like i should try to mod the stock prints sure... but they're way way worse add 1g of weight for some reinforcment and also, the cobra X aren't big. they're quite small"
i wanted to get a eachine EV200D but idk why i cant buy them on getfpv. really?,yeah. they're like binocular goggles but without the curve. they're not big or anything Fractal inspiration for you
oh okay. so i shouldnt get a EV200D?,definitely not. the X are the best you can get at the price I want front mounted ones not top. Plenty files for top mounteds what are the benefits of mounting a battery on the bottom vs the top. where you'll hit it lol And center of gravity
does using a lipo from the storage voltage (3.8v per cell) for a quick flight harm the battery in any way?. I usually charge to full before I use but I'm wondering if this works too for just a short flight,"No, as long as you keep to the usual guidelines of when to land and how low not to go (with voltage)"
right. dont go below 3.6 per cell right?,"you can try plugging in a battery i guess Land at 3.5, don't push throttle so hard that it sags below 3.2 okay. it only does like di... di... di... sound and thats it. not even motors moving"
like it moves a bit and makes more sound than only the three beeps. like you know they move a bit when they beep. so nothing wrong with the cli?,no... so can you try plugging in a battery to see if the gyro comes alive
really? I thought 3.6 is when you should land to keep the battery healthy,3.5 is the generally accepted value here. some people like to land earlier to get a bit more life out of their batteries. but that's for people who never ever crash. and since this is a FPV server....  lots of crashing.
so its broken if nothing works?,"I honestly can't help you because I don't have a clue what you're saying a lot of the times, I recommend you ask in the Betaflight Discord or make a thread here or even try and ask Vitroid idk the right terms :face_with_tears_of_joy:. i am trying my best. plus my english isnt good. ok soo basicly i tried flashing to 4.5 and even back to 4.4 and no sensor gets detected"
@Vitroid can you please help me fix my FC again? I also tried define ACCGYRO_BMI270 BARO_BMP280. I have this Stack https://skystars-rc.com/product/skystars-h743-hd-dualgyro-flight-controller-h7-x8-with-osd-km60-60a-blheli32-4in1-esc/,"Think so yeah. Its what i used to clean my motors. Far better than a pressure washer Lol. I saw some people said to disassemble them but I think that's crazy. Had an unfortunate crash. I swear I'm slow sometimes lol And sometimes near impossible. Meh happens to all of us. I crashed today too. Did a belly landing and one of my vtx cables broke out of its solder. Shit happens But bro it's bad lol. Sending video of it No damage tho besides sand all over the drone Idk why i didn't throttle up lol I'm slow Wtf were you tryna do Idk :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:. I told you it was bad THATS WHY I SAID IM SLOW SOMETIMES also why record the screen and then record is so badly I did throttle up but way too last second. Helped brace it too.

If i crashed my whoop like that itd oblitterate. Theeen again the whole canopy is 3d printed BUT STILL :sparkles: all fine :sparkles: Thats funny lol. But anyways this crux35 is incredible Hey heres a question My whoop doesnt really have alot of lift on its props due to its weight w prop guards Should i get 3 bladed or 4 bladed So I sprayed out my motors. When I turn them, I don't hear crunching anymore... that mean it's all out ig lol More blades = more drag = less battery life I want to buy a dji drone but if they get banned can i just sell it on ebay or something Ahh yes, sand free... Technically but if gets banned, there is going to be a massive wave of people selling theirs cheap. Plus it's gonna go mainstream so average Joe's will know and won't buy it Should i wait to get into this hobby"
time to go out and fly again. you did get batteries for the cobra's right?. and antennas?,"I don't even got the Cobra yet. Hopefully at the end of July. FPV blows camera drones out of the water I heard of those to but wouldnt the law ban those chinese brands. I heard the majority of like drone companies are chinese owned In the camera drone world, but FPV is different. Usually, you build your own from parts. So no Chinese ban on it Even for home built FPV drones, the DJI FCC ban will still impact the legality of using DJI's goggles, radios, and camera systems At least imo, unless you are constantly traveling, camera drones get so boring but FPV it's always fun even if you are flying on your backyard for the millionth time. True but there is other options for like the goggles especially if you are doing analog Indeed, Walksnail, HDZero, and Analog video are all alternatives. Just felt it was worth mentioning, since a lot of camera-drone crossover folks are already familiar with DJI Yeah it looks a lot more fun. Ooh okay Pretty much, yea. But the CCCPDA NDAA amendment isn't banning all electronics from China, it's only calling to list DJI (among others) on the FCC's black list"
So might i be fine using those listed alternatives?,"not might, more like will Alright thank you guys"
"U mean hdzero? I have dji goggles 2 for normal flying, but those dont support custom osd like that cuz theyre shit and cant quite afford hdzero atm for racing",if you can help me fix it. I would like to give you a little tip of 5-10€. or anyone who can help me ngl. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) yeah so he couldnt help me either. I am cooked af omg
show pictures. did you conformal it?,"nope. lemme send pics was the bush. perhaps wet Yea, the 2 video systems i dont own, also the dji goggles v2 does have the ability to use custom osd elements (or used to atleast, idk if it still can) I used a brush to clean it after soldering. But that was many days ago if you have the v2 goggles, install wtfos on it I didnt do anything else after that and yesterday I was flying around and crashed into a bush. props got damaged. I replaced the props and it took off again. Then I unpluged everything and went home. thats all was the bush you crashed into. wet uh. i dont think so. it was a sunny day because I see wetness and leafs on it"
water moves?.... get closer pictures of these with all components visible. and do you have a multimeter?,I will ask my father real quick if we have one Heeey that means good news for the rest of the world More cheaply available dji drones Good luck flying the.. Lol Jokes on you i'm not american. PLUS. American drone = FCC mode. So. 20km range instead of 2 No I dont have a multimeter but I will buy one.. But that little amount should have 100% dried out in 24h if my room is really hot. I mean if there was water in the first place. Idk if it helps but my MCU gets to 74°C in 80 sec uptime. Ill try to make better pics rn .. and clean the flux off with isopropyl ye i am trying to make better visible pics rn. and isoprobyl needs to wait because it ran out a few days ago. i need to buy a new bottle
what flux did you use?,some weird ass flux that a employee of a shop recommended to me. You wont know the brand. I can send a pic. Its more watery but I seen people use it for electronics as well. Yeah I know the translation is goofy. And this you should probably not use any of that again
can you recommend me one or two good flux to use?,"Stannol, MG Chemicals, Kester. they all make good flux. get the no clean kind. this looks sus. and also show the ESC if you can"
The two drops of  solder ?. Idk how to,near the white wire. and this white wire also isn't looking too nice Yeah. That shi is burned isnt it yeah that. doesn't look too good. is it possible one of your wires touched it. also your pads seem to be corroding... and that could be the result of your flux. @DædalusFPV Wow great worker at the shop ngl. Mf should be fired for not having knowledge when he specificly works at the section that has to do with solder. How can you tell that its corroding well you'd clean it with isopropyl first. but you see the blue stuff
You mean in this pic?. If you mean that. Yeah no it looks like that because I did 10x zoom on it and I dont have a macro lens on my phone. In real life it looks all good but only that one sus part you mentioned isnt looking great,"it could be dirt. but like. it's wet, it's blue"
Oh yeah I see it now. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) if I get a multimeter what should I check?,"well not much to check anymore. we found the broken stuff maybe. or you can wait till you have the isopropyl. and better flux and multimeter. see if we can make something happen Okay Ill try that first. but you need to clean that. right now. you can even use distilled water if you need to, just don't plug it in"
Btw how do I get this off? I wanna buy 422C coating,that's welding flux. which is corrosive yeah it has corroded the hell out of their board. they need to clean it like now and sue that store lol Imma cook up some water and make it distilled It's probably soldered on somewhere Haha would be funny but it would be a huge head ache. Ill throw that away rn that also explains why it went bad over night. your flux was basically just eating away at it
I was done soldering 1 week ago. Thats even worse. Okay so if this FC cant be fixed. Can you recommend a good FC that is compatible with the ESC from this stack? https://skystars-rc.com/product/skystars-h743-hd-dualgyro-flight-controller-h7-x8-with-osd-km60-60a-blheli32-4in1-esc/,you could just get the same one
Okay true. Is there maybe a cheaper option? I mean with 70€ I could also just buy a new stack,"of course, there are lower end FCs. there's no real reason for H7 on most builds"
Can you recommend a good fc that isnt that expensive?,"i still think this one could be saved tbh. if we knew the values of those resistors with all respect I don't think SMD rework is an option when welding flux was used without much 2nd thought I didnt find a way to contact skystars directly except social media I think it is. I've seen it done. and the damage doesn't look too bad. but definitely clean that thing up Yea, sadly i have the goggles 2 not v2"
what resistors are we looking at?,that's the only one that looks damaged. under the white wire Maybe info on here too https://skystars-rc.com/product/skystars-h743-hd-dualgyro-flight-controller-h7-x8-with-osd-km60-60a-blheli32-4in1-esc/
what component is that?,"i am guessing it's the gyros. but those don't look like bosch chips would may or may not be 10k. not 100% sure on that, who knows how up to date the source is I'm guessing the other one would have the same one right. could measure it up to confirm yea just checked, pretty sure it's 10k if we're to believe the schematics. measure the other one just to make sure Alright. Where do I get those exact ones in Europe. If thats the case"
"farnell, mouser, whatever. have you cleaned it?",I am trying to get clean destilled water. I mean I have to make it myself because its 23:00 o clock. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) make sure you clean everything that looks shiny or like flux. AND ESPECIALLY your ESC. because your ESC is still fine
So desolder and remove that top thing and clean it?,you can just clean it with the water. as long as you thoroughly dry it after. and don't plug it in for a while. like you only have to clean where the flux is. so
Okay. But if I really cant fix the FC no matter what. What FC could you recommend on getting that is compatible with this ESC? I dont wanns buy the same one cuz 60-70€,anything. it's all compatible. just get something from a good brand like usual Walksnail or hdzero or wtfos :slightly_smiling_face:
What are good brands except Skystars again?,"most really. Airbot, Diatone, iFlight. I think the Hobbywing XRotor stuff is good nowadays too"
And I should get F765 right?,Okay. But for now imma clean that esc and fc and then buy the multimeter and after 48h or idk what ill try to measure it with your help. I dunno how to do it. Ill give you a 10€ tip for all that help after for sure. I mean if you accept tips I don't. the isopropyl is also important. once you have the isopropyl we need to take a soft brush (or even just a toothbrush if you can be careful around the small stuff) and try and get the corrosion off there's like one or two F765 FCs out there. one of them being a wing FC AFAIK
yeah they do?. you're in Germany no?,Austria. I looked at a german website that sells kester and it says they dont deliver to me. Because of dangerous goods or whatever
I just found the same by looking again haha. Is this also working or is the one you sent better? https://www.reichelt.at/at/de/flussmittel-x32-10i-flux-no-clean-10-ml-stannol-x32-10i-p96335.html?PROVID=2807&gad_source=1&&r=1,I sent you a list. not a specific. but that one looks fine. it's at the very least way better. I prefer syringes though Imma buy 3 products of them and test which one is working best. Ah nvm ill use the syringe one. Looks good
does anyone know where to get a blheli_32 hex file so i can restore my esc?,https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/tbs-solder-100g-6318.html yeah that's fine. and good flux will make your life easy I already ordered xd. I changed my mind and ordered the flux pen aswell yeah most people prefer the flux pen And ill buy this too https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/silicone-conformal-coating-55ml-12357.html
Uh lemme check. If yes ill cancle the order and reorder. I dont think they have it. At least not what Ive been looking for. Is dual gyro kinda useless?,"you wont regret this :slightly_smiling_face: it will save your drone!. I recently lost my new 7"" £550 drone. Went looking for it the next day after it had rained for 8 hours straight through the night. Found it in the morning covered in rain water. Once dry plugged it in good as new, because of the above product."
"Uh there's a V4?. Oh hey, it's an upgrade to the V2",My questions is why is everyone saying V2 instead of the V4 if it's an upgrade I didn't know the V4 existed. Honestly anything past the V2 is great.. You should probably take a look at the differences online Ok. I didn't know it existed until today myself its honestly the same. i mean i think I'll dig around tomorrow

did you measure the other one already?,Okay ill look for it. I am in school right now but once I get home ill measure right away. Just wanted to look where I can buy it in advance
"So it saying 1% or 0,1% in the headline doesnt mean anything?",It's just the tolerance. Shouldn't matter too much
do all the radiomasters work with erls?,"can anyone recommend a controller and erls RadioMaster Boxer, RadioMaster Pocket, Jumper T20S, Jumper T15, anything RadioMaster they all can come with elrs. same for the jumper radios. just make sure you buy it with elrs so is any erls receiver going to be compatable yeah as long as they match in frequency. which they will. all 2.4"
so should i  get an erls from radiomaster or is there a better brand?. what makes one erls better than another. is this the pocket? https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/pocket-radio-controller-m2,yeah. that's the cheapest and smallest
what does fcc and lbt mean?. does that effect the range at all?,"FCC is US regulations, it basically means you have everything unlocked. LBT is EU stuff, it limits the output power and such Not really, it's just that the gimbals are smaller and the buttons aren't that great. they made it as cheap as possible but still great"
ok but its good for a beginner?,they all are. they're good even for non-beginners yep sadly i do not have acces to those :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: goggles 2 dosent suppport wtfos
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) do erls receivers matter? can I get any one just they have to be 2.4 frequency what gives better range? a longer antenna?,"Better antennas, diversity etc give better range. the Pocket can only do 250mW I think. the Boxer (better in every way for example) can do 1W. and yes you can get any elrs 2.4 receiver and it'll work, some cheaper ones are the happymodel receivers"
so how much distance does 250mw correlate to?,"distance doesn't matter. it can go forever the ""range"" is pretty much however far your drone can fly"
so the range is basically the last of my worries?. just battery life?,the penetration (how well the signal can go through walls and such) will of course significantly increase with higher power output
but 250w is good enough right?. can it be upgraded in the future?,yeah 250mW is good enough for most people. it can but it's better to like start with a boxer. these transmitters don't really break and they last forever
so i should start with a good receiver but then in the future upgrade the controller?,receivers are like. 13 bucks. the transmitter is the pricey part
ok sorry if i sound dumb but what is the transmitter?. ohh. wait. i know nvm. vTX?,TX is transmit. RX is receive. the v in vtx stands for video
yep. so are we talking abt the same transmitter?,"yeah. generally the controller/whatever/the thing you hold is referred to as transmitter sorry if i hijack this but im thinking about buying another remote to just fly whoops - 2"" which i can just put in a small backpack with the drones etc. currently i have the TX16S with CNC gimbals so i was looking at the T20 V2, but there is also the gemini version ( i know how that works) but im curious if the T20 is better compared to pocket. i saw a few commends on YT that they say the QC is bad Jumper QC is always meh but you shouldn't have any issues that can't be remedied relatively easy. the T20 is an amazing transmitter. the Pocket can't really ever rival the full-size gimbals. I doubt you'd specifically have any issues"
is it worth turning vtx power down from 400 on the mob6 2024? I'm just aware it can get quite hot esp if its sat still for a few mins. What are the implications of turning power down? Less quality/range?,"Less range. but whenever you're flying you shouldn't have any issues overheating. and as with any analog drone, if it's just sitting there you should put it in pit mode or point a fan at it Ok cool, i'll leave it at 400 then since I try to fly it as quick as poss and do put a fan on it if i need to check betaflight You can put pit mode on a switch if you'd like. it's quite helpful yeah I'll definitely do that, is that just a super low power vtx mode for when I need to troubleshoot something in the field yup. It's named pit mode because of racing. When it's in the pit, you have the VTX on pit mode :p ok nice thanks again :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
gotcha. Would u go with the Gemini version? i think 500mW will be pleanty for my use case,The Gemini version is 1W. I think all the T20's are. I would go with the Gemini version as I have a bunch of Gemini receivers
not sure. but the V2 only comes with RDC90 Sensor-Gimbals from what i can see. arent hall ones better?,rdc90 are hall. I think the rdc90's just have some nice cnc metal parts. not as good as AG01's though ok thanks once again :catgoodcat:
"actually, not sure if they are hall???","yea i dont think they are. but V2 only has RDC ones yeah, I wouldn't get the RDC90's. or I'd swap them out for hall ones"
"do u think its worth to ditch the V2 benefits (cooling, 1000mW,more powerful processor) to ""just"" get hall gimbals? (buying V1). it will be just for whoops - 2"" drones",jesus christ this is confusing. this is why people don't get jumper radios i mean i dont want to spend ~230€ to buy hall gimbals for another X€ to just fly whoops and stuff yeah it's kind of goofy. the normal T20 comes with hall gimbals though. and has 1W and cooling and stuff none of your whoops will have gemini. so I think that's okay on Banggood https://www.banggood.com/de/Jumperrc-T20-V2-ELRS-2_4GHz-or-915MHz-Hall-Sesor-or-RDC90-Sensor-Gimbal-Full-Size-EdgeTX-Radio-Transmitter-for-FPV-RC-Racer-Drone-Airplane-Helicopter-Car-Boat-p-2009149.html they offer Hall and RDC gimbals Should I get better antennas for RM Boxer no the stock ones are fine. seems good. what a confusing thing. to have their gemini model cost like. a 100 bucks more. for worse gimbals ok the T20S uses the RDC once apparently. true. will get hall ones from BG :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks
This is a screw and nut for the fpv go pro mount.    Could someone help with the queries below.  1) are these all a standard size across the board?  2) what is this specific screw called. I thought it was called a socket button screw but I don't believe this is the case. Unfortunately it doesn't fully clear the tpu so I can't use the nut on the end. Need to find a slightly longer 1.,"He would probably lose video way before tx link anyway not necessarily. oh I read that reverse. then yeah I have been wrecking my tinywhoop lately. Hit a branch, started to pitch, disarmed. Hit the ground hard, right side up. Armed again and flew it back, battery was squished they seem so durable yet so fragile Yeah, my frame is showing alot of signs that it will soon break.. The prop guards aren't even proper circles anymore I got the eachine e58 pro analog rx which is connected too my v2  I got the mobula 7hd I dont get any Video and when i push the select Band option on my rx it Switches too r3 aka the same thing i turned on in BF Socket flange button head ooo you talking dirty!. ty!"
what should i do if i ordered a camera with the wrong connector?. its for a tiny whoop. can i just solder the right one?,Solder it. You dont need to use the connector at all
What camera did you buy?,"The mobeetle6 fc has solder pads on it for the camera You can cut the connector off the camera, and solder the wires to the fc. Just snip the white part off Black is ground, red is 3-5.5v, yellow goes to camera/video in pad. You might need to share power and ground pads with the vtx"
so i just do it like on the old camera but without connectors?. oh i think i cant. how do i get the connector of the fc?,you can just leave it on. or unsolder it. but those 1s whoop boards are really thin and pretty heat sensitive so don't do it if you don't know how to
what about the black silicon thingy that secures the cables on the camera?. i can send a photo of it,leave it on. just cut off the connector Ah the diamond doesnt have a camera in pad
why hex screws over star heads?,philips head sucks. they just suck in every way. nothing good about them I believe they meant torx for me all my hex keys got stripped. nop I think they are called philips. ppl in my country call it star head People in my country call torx star head. So. Clarity is a virtue hah where I come from star head is phillips head whats some good hex keys that wont get stripped. like the very cheapest option Good hex keys are made from high quality materials. High quality materials are not cheap well yea. but still within those there is a cheapest option. I only need a 2mm hex Bondhus ball-end L-wrench allen/hex keys are fantastic. Wera and PB Swiss are good options too
is there any other website i can buy this cable from? i just dont want to pay 25$ for delivery,"Maybe, but thats the only one i know @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I got myself a multimeter. Do I just need to plug in USB or battery and USB. For measuring"
"none of those. you're just measuring a resistor, the board shouldn't need power. did you get the isopropyl too?",Nope but ima go buy today. I had something else to do today so I couldnt get one. Luckily my aunt had a multimeter so I didnt need to buy one. Okay yeah resistor is dead @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) well we knew that by the fact that it looks like it was on fire lol
https://www.getfpv.com/runcam-3pin-fpv-silicone-cable-for-runcam.html @Only Bans is this one good?,It probably will work
Can it also be measured with a multimeter?,"none of those is actually the resistor if it's tan/brown/yellow-ish, then it's most likely just a capacitor And how do I check if the capacitor is broken. No resistor on my board is broken I was just told we were looking for a resistor She said this looked burned that is a capacitor, yea some multimeters can. though a cap there is likely not crucial for basic functionality"
When I was measuring it was beeping continously. Other ones didnt beep. Only the red marked ones beeped. Does it mean theyre malfunktioning and I need to replace them?,you're not supposed to do continuity tests on them
Could my problem be because of that capacitor where the red arrow points towards?,"no, that should just be a filtering cap. not necessary for function Hmm okay then there might be another problem with my FC. Betaflight doesnt detect any sensors at all. Sometimes Baro indicator in Betaflight lights up but thats about it (if I flash it with defining it specifically, e.g. BARO_BMP280 in my case) yeah I am not good at remembering english names. facepalm"
Should I just buy a new FC?,"well that's good. the little metal-looking cube thing next to the gyro's is probably the barometer can you take better pictures from the angle of the wires. of the gyros once you have isopropyl you'll just want to scrub all the oxidation and stuff off. scrub around the gyros too. BUT NOT HARD because the capacitors and stuff will come off if you're not careful @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). I ordered it from amazon because 2 shops didnt have it Idk but thats the same one that you called sus the day before well yeah it's the broken one. but what's around it looks like it maybe corroded through But Vitroid said its not necessary if it was just the cap that's broken, it'd be fine yeah but it can still have fricked up other stuff but it looks like other stuff around it is damaged like the traces and such Okay then Ill get a new FC and just throw this one away if other stuff around it is damaged. Without flashlight it looks like this i mean i'll take it if you don't want it. lol I thought stuff around it is damaged well first of all maybe with some isopropyl and some careful careness it'll look all good again. second of all if I were to have it I'd just harvest all the working components off of it for other stuff"
and you think it could might  work again if i clean it good enough?,it's possible. not the likeliest thing And if not I can probably just harvest all the working components off it like you said and buy a new one. ill remove the wires for vtx and elrs receivers for now and clean it with isopropyl lesson learnt about corrosive materials I guess. and awful store employees imma write a complaint to their headquarters and ask for a compensation if its possible. and i will only listen to people on drone related discords from now on
Did you choose USB Joystick?,help my pocket doesnt work on pc. i plug in the usb on the top with usb c. but it doesnt reconise it
yes. it keeps reconisging and un recon. idk how to spell it. ill show u in vc. hello?,"@The GGManiack. Also in other channels done, thx @Maticzpl  (would be more effective to tag Moderators next time, but fortunately I was here lol) Yeah wasnt sure if i had to tag all mods or not :P"
hello i got a question will this https://www.6sfull.cz/f4-1s-5a-aio-brushless-flight-controller/ and this https://www.koptery.cz/pod-2205/gts-v3-0802-25-27k-kv/ and this https://www.rotorama.cz/product/dogcom-550mah-1s-150c will it work together or will it burn? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,"Looks ok for a 75mm build. Not sure if 550mAh will fit in 75mm frames though do you think that its okay to build it in a meteor65 :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: No, that battery definitely won't fit"
at what temperature should i solder?,Most people start at 350. go up if really necessary
Are there any information about the rx sensitivity from a speedybee analog Module?,"There is not a published spec, but based on the testing I've done and the tests done by others, I would guess that the sensitivity is the same as the Rapidfire and the Fusion at -96dBm"
Thank You :thumbs_up:. Are there any better modules?,"Rapidfire, Speedybee, and Fusion are the top three"
What do you want to test?,"output power from the VTX, or whether my helical antennas provide the desired dbi. IRC Power meter is *good enough* for hobby VTX testing. You'll need an LNA for antenna testing."
"The immersionrc power meter doesn't seem to be available anywhere in Europe, and what does the other device cost?","Those are lab-grade devices. A *lot* of money So when building antennas, keep your fingers crossed that you have done everything right :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
"doesnt have that option. u mean  ""Dyn""?","Yea, that's what I meant. Stupid that"
Radio have the 2.8.4 should update the EdgeTx first to v2.10.1 or no need to?,"You don't need to, but it's generally a good idea to get everything up to date at once if i turn my ESC 180 degrees around, do I still have my FC the right way and just turn the ESC in betaflight You can't just turn the ESC in BF Configurator like you can the FC. You'd need to re-assign all of the motor outputs, which is more complicated"
"<https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner> Does this help? Analog goes with analog, ExpressLRS goes with ExpressLRS, Motor goes with ESC","If you're looking for a website that allows you to narrow down part selection by automatically knowing what is compatible with what, then no, that doesn't exist. But as Emilia linked above, there are websites that help you learn what you need to know in order to do it yourself. FWIW, this is information you will need to understand anyway https://www.quadpartpicker.com/. @DædalusFPV ^^^ Yea this doesn't really do what their example website does though, its not very intelligent It keeps resetting my inputs and doesn't have half the items I have on my quad. :loudly_crying_face:"
"Have you done a benchtest?  https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/pre-1stflight/#bench-test. Your RSSI dBm is very bad here, which suggests your antenna is broken or there is some other serious problem with your setup",I looked in the menu and there wasn’t an AV mode Long press the search button Ok that works. Thank you :D More likely the antenna on the FC. Take a clear photo of the FC. Remove the canopy maybe its because its a mobula 6 2024. i cant really get a good flight because always getting critical signal
What does that matter?. This copper wire here is your ELRS antenna,Make sure it isn't shorting against anything he isnt the soldering is clean beetween
remove battery 3 times right?,"No. That's binding mode. https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/webui/#how-to-get-to-the-web-ui i will send you from my phone, i havent laptop to connect via wifi I already updated my TX to newest firmware and ELRS too"
What TX do you have?. This has not been updated,Radiomaster Boxer (Brand new). The quad doesnt yea Try updating the quad to 3.4.2 But in Radio iam runing lastest firmware in ELRS and EdgeTX Flash via Betaflight passthrough. This is the target. <https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/receivers/hmep2400/#via-passthrough>
Why would you need a fan?. Just plug in USB and flash,"Will try flying tomorrow, but its kinda weird last flights. I stop mid fight the drone in the ground and get like ""No signal"". And the drone its like 4M from me These FCs have been very problematic. I'd try contacting HappyModel support or the vendor you bought it from and see if they can arrange a replacement Bought from banggod brother, just RIP their support is really bad, i sent back last month a tinnywhoop for get money back, got stuck at customs 4/06 they just dont care and the item might come back to me ur destroyed :thumbsup2: Try HappyModel :man_shrugging:. They know there are a ton of issues with these. Maybe they'll do something Thank you for your time, i kinda have afraid to fly around my house (have a lot of terrain) and lose signal in mid air and crash really bad Yeah, something is definitely wrong with the FC."
if i have a frsky FC AIO with internal FRSKY can i disable it and mouny my own elrs ?,as long as they don't share a uart yes
it’s best to charge a battery back to storage voltage right after you use it right?,yes. do not leave them empty. really bad for them :thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up: does anything look wrong here. i cant get anything on my goggles. my goggles are on raceband 2 maybe if you showed a full screenshot. and the ports tab. and make sure you have a battery in batteries in. wait no the batteries not in one sec. the batteries in
Do you have the correct vtx table?,yup i checked a bit ago
Check again. It's on uart 2 right?. Solder to it as well,idt i can solder anything. its the crazybeef4sx1280. the aio board

it might be getting hot im not too sure its on a fan. is it not the vtx + fc usa?,there's multiple versions. v3.1 and v3.3
how do you stream the googles v2 video to a phone? Can you just plug a lightning to usbc cable in?,"They will work, afaik you just won't be able to buy some o3's for them, cause it's just banning them from selling DJI stuff in the USA, it doesn't suddenly brick their hardware"
surely you can still by the o3 in other countries and getting imported over?,"of course, but you will have the shipping cost on top. they don't have x rays that check if you are importing some dji stuff at the ups office hey does the pocket regulate the wattage and like charging cause it just went from 7.3 to 7.6 and i'm pretty sure they don't care that you buy some dji stuff from other countries, the bill is only supposed to stop *them* from selling in the usa afaik. yeah, just plug it in the bottom port and it will charge the 18650 inside"
yeah but. if i use a very powerful brick. will it brick the batteries?,the wattage of a psu is just the voltage it outputs * how much amps it can output without exploding. not how much it's pumping into the device
hey guys is this a good drone https://www.fpvfaster.com.au/products/ymzfpv-lighting1-micro-2-inch-2s-freestyle-analog-drone-bnf-elrs?_pos=12&_sid=0ab81e0db&_ss=r,"Betaflight only initializes the SPI receiver hardware when SPI is selected.  Without that, even though the hardware is still powered up, it's getting no commands to do anything, be that transmit or receive, or even activate.. So in that case you can ditch the antenna."
Ohh then u can’t help me I geus ? Haha,Hey!   So I have a big problem…biggest noob out here on fpv drones. But really wanna get into it so I bought a cheap old setup but it worked.  Now I plugged the controller into my pc for training on a sim but now the drone won’t bind with the controller…. No idea what reciever or anything I have so idk what to do. Tried YouTube but couldn’t figure it out waht radio is that im blind It’s Dutch but I think u can see it the drone. eeh. idk im not experienced do u know if spi or uart shit. uhm. have u hooked to beta flight. yo
"OK, after 2.5 hours i've found the issue and a way to resolve it. It's due to the drone being shipped with ELRS V2.x and my Pocket having 3.x. Now i either downgrade my Pocket(which i've tried and failed with) or i just update my ESC irmware to one that supports ELRS.   And i've been having issues with exactly the latter due to it failöing to open the serial port after rebooting. i've got all i need, so that means the hex codes, board version and everything. Any1 know what might've caused this?. my guess is that your 2 multimeters don't put a high current load on the batteries while ur checker and your charger probably put a lil higher current load on them making the voltage drop",Ok so both my multimeter say 16.2 while my charger and voltage checker both say 16 now which one do I trust
For what do I need or can I use the barometer?,Well what should I do bcz if I charge fully with my charger the multimeter shows 17v
altitude control i just measures the ambient preasure. do you have a normal 4s lipo?,yea. its a tattu funfly 1300 yea 17v seems about right
but das 4.25. shouldnt it be 16.8 with 4.2?. like when its fully charged my charger shows 16.8 while multimeter shows 17,"95% sure, yeah. im a drone noob but ik a bit bout electronics. just seems like your multi is innacurate by 0.2 v its a unit 33-B. idk much about multimeters but I thought this one was good. and like accurate it's pretty accurate for the price but the ones i saw are like 8 bucks which is rlly cheap for a multimeter. i would trust the charger more ye it was prolly around 10$. but then again the charger is a cheap chinese knockoff of a real charger. I was unaware of it being a knockoff when I bought it i just found it's specs according to them its rated accuracy o.2v is within it's rated tolerance so yes your values are correct and ur pack seems normal im jus worried about overcharging it. coz everyone says upto 4.2 while this might be going upto 4.25 i would trust ur checker and charger onb this one"
does anyone know how exactly edgetx radios set to csrf on the external module communicate to that module? is it just serial?,"It's CSRF :p. but I guess you can just call it serial, yes. the protocol is csrf"
"yeah i figured, cant find anything about the specific payload sadly. if i google anything like crossfire i just get products and stuff, is ther a spec somewhere?","well the protocol isn't called crossfire. it's called csrf. I'll try and get the link i see, ill check if i can find something you can always just read the ELRS code too"
"mostly its people reading from a rx, is it the same?","yes i know, but that is to complicated for me :D. tried and undrrstoud some things, but not enough to impplement <https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/011abb384c087b54aeb97b556514905423e777b3/src/lib/Handset/CRSFHandset.cpp>. You can also just go and see if any of these can do it for you if you need that yeah i know and used both of these before, but they are just for reading recievers. as far as i kow at least I don't know if they're any different but I can't find the repo for the spec. :picardfacepalm: https://github.com/crsf-wg/crsf found it that seems a little too new. and I thought CapnBry was part of ELRS, not TBS/Crossfire"
how do you stream the googles v2 video to a phone? Can you just plug a lightning to usbc cable in?. or is it even possible?,"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) multiposted across at least two servers, continuing in ELRS. the crsf wg is basically a community sources spec for the protocol there ain't nothing there yet https://github.com/crsf-wg/crsf/wiki/CRSF_FRAMETYPE_RC_CHANNELS_PACKED this seems to be what i need. it's in the wiki section that's obnoxious. why in the world yeahhhhh GH wiki lowkey sucks. aaaanyway I would much rather for all this conversation to continue in one place, in one server I'm too scared to set foot in ELRS lol"
i may have replaced the driver on my stm32 instead of the bootloader and now betaflight won't recognize it anymore... how fed am i?,"yes, GH wiki pages are just fancy git repos with a mostly hidden backend. you can pull them like regular repos `git clone https://github.com/crsf-wg/crsf.wiki.git`. it's all in markdown. well, technically GFM, but basically markdown Markdown with plugins. plugins that aren't GitHub specific but GitHub claimed the name it's like a modpack. we don't call a modpack by the set of all its mods. :KEKw: It's like reuploading a modpack lol. ""this is mine now"". ""i changed da symbols"""
hey guys any recommendations on which walksnail VTX to put on this flywoo explorer kit? its essentially everything except the VTX,I would go with the hd v2 or pro vtx/camera to save weight over the moonlight kit
Updated my mobula 6 ELRS but what should i put here?,"Single antenna would be best, there is really no need for 2 (most of the time)"
and then i wanna get the pro for the sony starvis sensor? I would like to fly in low light sometimes so,If you want better low light performance get the pro. If you want even better low light performance there is their IR camera
10-4 boss. tempting but then dont i have 2 boxes? the transmitter and the like AI box or whatever?,"but radio isnt showing up Yeah idk about how they work with the stupid ai board yea i aint fitting tht chunker But I think I saw somewhere an option to get a moonlight with a slim vtx. Should just be a 20x20 vtx that is just taller than the slim version yea but tht AI box is in addition to a transmitter no... you need the extra board to use the infra cam what emilia said. u need the chunker, and a walksnail vtx board' you *can* get the moonlight with *just* a camera board to plug into the v2 vtx though. but at that point just get the full unit I just checked, and it was indeed the stupid ai board, not a slim vtx"
was it bound before? radio was working fine before you updated it?,"Well, might as well get the pro then Updated ELRS and reseted everything yeah TX have signal with quad why... why did you not make a backup. show the ports tab. what mob6 is this. that looks entirely wrong yeah that's not what it's supposed to look like i updated ELRS and reset everything. I didnt make any change yet"
you just said you opened elrs and updated. what did you do?,"express lrs configurator and updated the version. just that. Yesterday. mobula is connected with TX but betafligh is fucked up You should try to contact happymodel if nothing works, even if you didn't buy it from them they should help you"
do you mean that I select it in the program?,and after saving it deactivates all ports
Did you set the Configuration/MSP switch on UART4 yourself?. And this is a Walksnail VTX no?... it doesn't use IRC Tramp,"Tramp and MSP is an invalid combination You should update your Betaflight to the latest version and follow the Walksnail manual for BF 4.4 I was told that I should activate UART4, it's my first self-built drone, and according to the instructions I have to switch on UART1, but when I do that alone the video transmitter only says ""Your VTX is not configured..."". (https://caddxfpv.com/products/walksnail-avatar-hd-pro-kit) I've tried but can't get any further the video transmitter tab has nothing to do with your digital VTX. it's just for analog"
oh well.. thought it was also for digital. Are there different receivers for digital cameras than for analogue ones?,"But you haven't done *any* of what I said. yes I followed the instructions from the camera today before I wrote here you need to update betaflight Now that's really stupid... my other one was analogue, can someone recommend a receiver module from the camera for the glasses <https://www.rotorama.de/product/walksnail-avatar-vrx> wait what goggles do you have and what vtx do you have"
what the fuck are those goggles. and yea thats a analog receiver. not a great one. but analog. whats your vtx. @Vitroid have u ever heard of these goggles?,"once or twice, but I have never seen someone actually have them Then I have something special ;D idk if thats special good or special bad. either way. @ZeroTwoZero what vtx do you have"
do you mean from the camera? it's a kit that comes with it,"yea. tahts what a vtx is It's my first self-made one, I don't have much idea yet vtx = video transmitter. camera -> video transmitter -> antenna -> vrx (video receiver) Avatar V2 Modul if I don't mix it up"
so is there any downside to getting a diversity receiver then?,so then this is all u need https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1254149266172285139
Are there other receivers for digital?,not for walksnail. theres an hdzero one. but u need an hdzero camera and vtx then and also hdzero is a diff type of digital oke thanks for info :D
"for latency, it depends on what you're wanting to do. racing? freestyle? cruising? long range? cinematic recording?","racing and freestyle I've only had analogue so far and don't know any key details about it hello guys. How do I get started in maaking a drone. And by that I mean I can figure out the arduino and motors by myself. I mean the software. like stabilization arduino's haven't been used in like 10 years but like technically you could erm what the sigma. do you think it would be possible for me to learn how to build one over the span of 50 days. not arduino just any type of drone fosho. whats ur budget. and what type of drone do u wanna make. and what country u in godamn. ok uh my budget is not too expensive. I dont really have it set in mind. but it cant be >$250. a basic drone that has a library I can contrl it with. It's for an instructable contest. ""Farm to table"". im thinking a drone with a net that gets peaches from a tree thats too high for people to reach. ill use computer vision and some raspberry pi for the opencv and the contest is over in 51 days so your budget is $250, and thats going to be very hard to all that for this budget due to needing transmitter, charger, batteries and the drone itself and if u want video then goggles/screen as well"
so u dont need camera?,cameras only for computer vision
can someone help me with some softserial?,so you need some type of video reciever tho. yea thats going to be very very tight ok i mean. how much would you say it would cost uh probs cloesr to 500 without video gear um. I have a 3d printer. I dont know if that changes anything
nah not rlly. it helps ig so u can design your own grabber system. @Vitroid any input on this?. ur the pro,could I get like a cheap $50 drone and then work from there here https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds are some good builds and here https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment the stuff u need for controlling and seeing shit yes if you don't want to build. and you're okay with a tinywhoop. you can get away with 300 bucks
Question about pinecil the whole metal part is hot or just a tip? And shoud i use that filmware what is on it or shoud i upload other one?,"metal is conductive so all of it is hot. do not touch it, even the plastic next to it can get warm"
Okey so i wont be touching it. I shoudnt go past the Rubber part ye?,"u can, just be careful"
I don't think the pinecil needs firmware?. like it comes with a loaded firmware,"I am not sure if its filmware or how its called but like the style of the display and etc. Not sure abt this but i heard that its better with some other filmware that I do not know about, maybe someone else does know Nah just asking its okey thanks for the help betaflight is the most basic one. there are other softwares for extra things, but not all drones can use those softwares If enable UART1  Serial RX and save it saves but if i eanble Serial RX and ConfigurationMSP then reset settins and turn both off you don't need to set configuration msp yourself but vtx settings doesnt appear. idk why. In Peripherals i chose one of the VTX settings there to try and then save e reboot. but just go back to default and serial rx back to off Serial RX is where the Receiver is connected to.. You can't have two things (Receiver and VTX) connected to one UART. Unless it's specifically ELRS + OpenVTX in this case. you can. Don't touch the MSP setting yourself. set the peripheral to displayport and serial rx. then save Mobula6 2024. ELRS+OpenVTX I love how they didn't say but u know what iam talking about because hour ago called for help xd. Trying to flash factory firmware but doesnt even start to update in betaflight. :angry:"
what is a realistic range on the RM pocket elrs?. its a 250mw transmitter trying to decide between this and the rm boxer which is 1w. any thoughts are greatly appreciated,penetration is the main concern. range doesn't matter
"mate, we are not a discord server to advertise some drop shipping. also @Moderator since it breaks the third rule. also if you don't want people to immediatly know it's a drop shipping site don't directly rip off the product images of the original product. also does anyone has any clues what this thing is supposed to be ? I have been looking at it for like 10min I don't get what it's supposed to be. it's called a fingerbot","no worries, but more thanks for deleting it"
Hi guys i have a dji goggles integra and should i upgrade it to dji goggles 3 do you guys think i can have better range with goggles 3 or just same thing?,"guys what software supports arduino for drones. I know multiwii does but thats a bit dated. and Idk if it's updated version, betaflight supports it. Im not trying to make some super cool fpv drone or anything. just one that functions stable that's because using arduinos is outdated, just use a modern flight controller brother I do not want to spend $300. on a drone thats made for agility and fpv. for my purposes an outdated drone works wait a ding darn second. your right!. Except wait. ill have to buy other peripherals. and the entire thing will end up being $300. like on of those stacks a Radio, FPV goggles, LiPo charger that wont burn your house down, and a custom built drone, under $300, is kinda impossible"
"Ok thank you, could be nice because there is a screen on it. But, JB sait that we can use a dji RC (the one which looks like a xbox controller) no ?. Actually he said that we can control the dji 03 unit","Hello, quick question. Does the dji RC work with a drone fpv please (and a dji 03 unit) wdym. thats the fpv. not dji rc. thats the dji fpv remote Unless you only ever want to use the avata 2, don't get the g3, the g3 aren't compatible with anything other than the avata 2. It will still cost over 300 bucks once you buy everything, even if it's Arduino based hey aymeric. for the antennas. what antennas i get again. i accidently lost the uhhh"
which specific one?. DJI has a bunch of radio controllers,but I hoped that the dji controller with the screen works whith a fpv drone but no...
do you already have one and want to know if it works with an O3 or what?. I am confused,"No I don’t have any stuff good, then don't even buy those overpriced and underperforming"
"Yes, a basic one is 100€ no ?. Or maybe a little bit less. Thank you for the piece of advice",a Radiomaster Pocket ELRS costs like $65 USD. and will easily have more range and features than the DJI radio
"Ho yes it’s half price of dji stuff. Ho I have an other question if you have 2 minuts. Does it is possible not to have goggles whith a drone (dji 03 unit) and use a screen like dji mini 3 pro ?  And, do you know a website where I can find a dji goggle 2 or  integra nieuw or refurbished not too expensive please ?","no, for the O3 you need DJI goggles * which is safe. Ok thank you I think DJI has an official refurb shop on ebay"
"Yes I found it, 300€ for dji goggles 2 but the seller is ́’ a ghost’́ (740 goggles sold). Is there any camera which can work like a dji mini 3 pro so please?","no, DJI doesn't have any FPV displays Dji or any other. Brand. Caddx Walksnail does have a video receiver which you can attach to any display. but that's about it Ok thank you really much. I found it, that’s really expensive :DIWhy:   Thank you again and have a good day"
Mateks are usually ardu capable boards yea?,"yes. but for wings no reason not to get speedybee Oh yea definitely, I'm looking at something for a 7in rn I wouldn't get anything Matek for a quad anymore. H743 > F765 > ATF435 > F405 > F722 > F411. Ardu can't run on the ATF chip, and not on the last 2.. Should help you filter"
Ok so no go for the 722 and 411?. Otherwise could I just brute force ardu even if it isn't advertised?. I'm thinking about just going with speedybee since I'm used to it,"I'd go and see if there's support for Diatone FC's. Or Skystars, Airbot, whatever"
"If it doesn't smell sweet, the IR is the same and it still holds voltage well? yeah",Is a battery safe to use if its a bit dented :PepeDent: i have linked you the lipo guide before right Just elrs stuff. Unless you didn't ping me when you sent it idk <https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/>. internal resistance is the best way to see if your battery is healthy
Would it still be as expensive?,"I dont need fpv goggles. Ill 3d print the frame myself with how many times it will break and how likely that is to damage your electronics, probably, thats assuming you can even get it to fly"
how can I remove this glue residue?,"without the goggles its still not possible but you can get close Cheapest drone build I can make is $174, probably $200 with shipping and tax Controller is $70 Charger is $40 (requires external power supply) LiPo $25 Total would be $335 dude. hundreds of people have tried this. it doesn't work, stop being stubborn. You'll spend less money buying a CNC machine capable of cutting carbon fiber. come on don't.. just.... don't.. you'll lose / break more expensive electronics parts with that than with a proper sturdy CF frame. Isopropyl alcohol or acetone goo gone. btu iso probs works as well"
I tried connecting my Mobula8 for setting up in BF but my system doesn't recognise the drone.... Does anyone know how I can fix this?,Get a different cable. this one has no data wires also CF frames are not even that expensive Omg :man_facepalming::man_facepalming: Thank you!!
Is it updated. Like fully up to date it won't let you update anything?. And are you using the proper dji app,Google pixel 7 pro. the ones ive tried are Dji fly and GoFly d.j.i. and the gofly i just installed today DJI fly should be the one. I just flew my mini 2 on my 7a and it worked fine. Make sure the phone isn't overheating since the DJI controllers charge the android phones where did u get the app from. dji fly DJI has an official APK you can download yea. the play store one is bad. get the apk from dji website
"Thought they removed the play store one?. That ain't it. @Lylla Ratatoskr. Go to the download center, it'll ask you some security questions when you install so your phone knows its ok to let it install",Okey. I use to use DJI fly on my mavic but the I sold it then used it on this drone the well it stopped working and my friends stop working too. Yea try the official one I haven't used my mini is a long time but now we have a critical flood warning so I went to get some shots and well it didn't get any lol.. so when doing so sence it didint record or get good fps i took screen shots of that it was looking at lol
"Wow. That's wild, where is this?",in those pics thats all corn fields. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/LXyG394iwmGHpF9e/
Damn rip iowa. What caused this?. Or is this like a seasonal type deal but it's worse this time,"18 inches of rain from Minnesota and the rain we just had the past week. the water level is 16 feet higher than normal Never been around there much, been to northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Wow that's crazy wish there was a non-busy time for sioux falls yes it is ive seen alot of jhon boat videos same in spencer. https://www.facebook.com/share/v/r8uC4nXzRA49EYNN/. Pictures I took today at 4 pm tons of flood warnings in Minnesota and Wisconsin too. pretty bad Well we did have 2 major storms roll through in less than 2 weeks. I'll have to ask the family then see if anything is near them it's pretty crazy currently. especially near the river Lol what river you mean a lake with a stroller current lols That's a big river anyways Wisconsin River is amazing I grew up in Wausau Wisconsin That's where my family is from. I usually go visit each year Yeah we use to but everyone moved most to palitien near Chicago. Wisconsin as a whole is a beautiful state. Best stare I've been. state Second best is Michigan I somehow have managed to never go there. I've been in Detroit for a flight, but otherwise no. even though there's family there I use to live on the great lakes but only for 3 months bc we moved away from Florida after hurricane Katrina and we were offered a job in Michigan and they sold the company so then we basically went homeless and my Grandparents took us in.. So yeah was short lived I'd love to see more of Minnesota and Michigan Michigan is beautiful Minnesota is meeh What's the max range of walksnail avatar mini 1s with walksnail vrx In a clear environment 1 foot of range. real. oh then 2 feet oh. 2 feet. maybe 4. feet. max 10 feet"
any recommendations then?,idk lol. dotn listen to me. it might be amazing. im just joking
"Hey, trolling is not appreciated in the help channels.. Range or penetration?","as far as the horizon goes Lol it's probably very similar Depends on your environment, but it's good enough for bandos and forests when you have nice directionals okay. what antennas should i use for increasing range Two TrueRC X²-Air MK2 I think the mushrooms do good is this stock antenna enough"
these are for the vrx right?,the newer ones are fine. yup
okay and for the vtx?,Anything at all. Foxeer Lollipop. FlyFishRC Osprey okay thanks for the help If you really want good range and connections to anything get the radio Master TX16s. They can bind to nearly anything and are great quality for the money I was asking about the video vrx and vtx but thanks for the suggestion for radio i was thinking of going with a RM pocket and rp3 reciever Well if I'm right that controller has something to do with fpv but never looked into it. Well save your money and get that remote as you only need 1 of them instead of buying 10 cheaper ones.. Plus it touche screen and has all features you will ever need even the most advanced range you can get within the  RC hobby. I got a Zorro and I wish I had a boxer most days. Radio master boxers are just king in terms of bang for buck
Do you have a cheaper option in mind?. It's too expensive in my country,"You should tell em your budget tx16 is ridiculously expensive for what you get and the only reason to get it is to flex  lmao boxer has more powerful elrs too, and is a much better option overall Tx16 is like 150. Usd it's 200... for the base model. and for that much all you get is 250mw Oh nvm, still I think it's so worth"
Really? I thought this was basically the only controller that can connect to almost any receiver,"boxer is 140 and you get a 1w module... so unless you want a fancy screen to put animated tits on your radio... I don't see the point That's the 4in1 controllers $40-50 for the walksnail vrx antenna walksnail vrx has 2 integrated patch antennas, so I'd recommend getting two nice omnis like axiis or truerc singularities. pretty much all radios can be bought in options for different protocols, like 4in1 which supports a bunch. but that doesn't matter because elrs is the only valid option"
I thought elrs was very picky on what it can bind too?,elrs recievers bind to elrs transmitters lmao Yeah I don't think I have any idk but the same logic applies to crossfire and tracer frsky isn't even worth mentioning the performance is so bad. and crossfire and tracer are much more expensive with no improvement over elrs Yeah I was originally going to go with frsky then someone told me I should use the tx16 so I did reach and figure it would be a great by and so far I like it.
https://www.racedayquads.com/products/truerc-singularity-5-8ghz-stubby-rp-sma-antenna-for-dji-lhcp are these good for the vrx?. i need like 4km range in a forest environment,"that should work. I'd get something a little taller, since your head can kind of eat the signal if you're flying behind you, depending on how your goggles are positioned. make sure to fly in front of you, and keep in mind trees eat a lot of the signal but thanks @Swirf that fixed my issue installing APK app or whatever it is. that's a little excessively long lmao. I'd get something along the lines of 40-60mm. that works, not too sure how good those antennas are though ok. i got the idea i will find some good ones. thanks for the help Excuse me guys. Can anyone with a sigma mewer grindset tell me what they think of this. https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Design-and-3D-Print-Your-Very-Own-Quadcopte/"
Lemme ask you a question did you give some deep thought as to why most drones except for the very smallest ones use carbon fiber frames?,"Yes bro. My boy ghoastbee told me in geberal I'd go with long antennas if you want range, not stubbies @Iceagehttps://anubisrc.com/product/truerc-singularity-5-8-sma-long-antenna-lhcp-sma/ these are the only ones i can find for the walksnail vrx and one thing, the vrx is getting to a display, not on the goggles so i think these antennas will do Oh you can probably just use any stubbies then, the first ones you sent should work ok. the vrx is gonna go in a ground station type suitcase yeah they’ll do then, especially if it needs to be compact https://anubisrc.com/product/truerc-singularity-stubby-5-8ghz-antenna-set-for-dji-lhcp-rp-sma-2pcs/. going with these now. @Iceage yep those are perfect"
"Hello. is there a HD vtx and vrx system besides dji, walksnail?. long range (4km)","https://tenor.com/view/hdzero-dji-fpv-dji-walksnail-fpv-gif-27212337 Hdzero, that outside of the jokes still looks good, plus it now has the micro v3 that genuinely looks pretty nice, you should go watch some videos about it tho idk about the ""long range"" requirement with it"
How is it relevant?. It's an analog VTX,"People went 8km out with it on some x2 air (botgrinder), with good antennas it's perfectly capable"
Is that digital system?,And there wasn't much breakup in the video. Yes
Name the system this person used?,"I already said it like 5 messages earlier. It's hdzero Ggmaniac also said it i thought it was some other system The meme about HDZero is that it's not very HD better than analog tho. There are only 3 good digital systems currently in use DJI, WS, HDZero But we love it regardless of it's low bit rate it's mostly the cameras being poo You can technically add openIPC"
What's the quality and range i can get with an analog system?,"Oh, ok, cause some people on the hdzero discord blamed the low bit rate"
"I mean, with analog you can just buy a 5w foxeer vtx and a ratel 2 pro, but it will still look like analog. I see, do you know if they are bad cause carl is bad at making cameras, or is it just that the low latency sensors are crappy ?",I meant the video resolution There are two video resolutions. PAL and NTSC. Technically like 456p iirc on pal. Might be wrong on the exact number NTSC is 480i 30hz PAL is 576i 25hz
okay and what's the range on those?,"Ok yeah I was way off. It's the same. Ntsc and pal is just two different video formats Analog VTX's don't care about video format.  Rather, they have no concept of it at all. They just output whatever the fc is giving them They just get an analog signal on the input and they flush it out the antenna on 5.8GHz.. Camera is what makes the PAL/NTSC signal.  PAL has a lower framerate, but higher resolution."
"what range can i get with analog, same as digital or higher?","Some cameras can switch between them, some are fixed.. Ehhhhh. That's complicated Infinite, until you loose video lol. Analog stuff is usually kinda cheaper and shittier It depends a lot on a lot of things Digital stuff is usually expensive and fairly good"
what about in a forest?,"Digital tends to have a better time with obstacles. Analog falls apart due to reflections Wesley Vardy went like what 60-80km out before loosing video on his elrs range test But yeah it depends massively on your antenna setup. if you use a f*ing satellite dish then you're going to get a lot of range. (if you don't screw up the polarization lmao) But not a lot of beam width. Yeah, he probably could have gone all the way if he didn't You're not going to be losing range with Digital over a comparable power Analog system.  But you will lose some flexibility.. With an antenna setup which performs the same, Digital systems often fare better with going through obstacles, especially reflective ones.. Due to the shorter individual transmission times. i asked about walksnail and got suggested foxeer and truerc antennas on vtx and vrx for 4km range. any chance a analog system will beat that. in a forest I mean, technically. Just get two x ray and it will beat walksnail on some x airs. Especially if you have omnis on the top thanks to the stupid antenna situation of walksnail. (it only has one TX port, which basically means you are limited by whatever antenna you put on this one tx port) okay, thanks for the help everyone. i will be staying digital and look into HDzero"
Can the solder iron touch in both apds or should not touch?,"You need to bridge those pads. You don't have to solder them together, you could use a small flat screwdriver or tweezers or smth, just to bridge those pads when you apply power. If you solder them together, you'll need a way to remove that solder later (otherwise the FC will *always* go into DFU mode) basically a normal eletrecilty cable will work Yea, but those pads are super small, I really wouldn't contend that they are meant for you to be soldering things to"
or need to aply pressure to make the connection? the problem is that i have like parkison on my hands lmao,Yea that does present a challenge
i need to put pressure until i flash or I just need to conect at usb. and then i can leave?,"You only need the pads to be bridged when power is connected. After that, you can remove the connection and it will stay in DFU mode until its rebooted/power-cycled. It does not hurt it to have the pads bridged for any length of time, so you don't have to remove the connection right away. If you have a way to remove solder from the board, you could bridge the pads with solder, boot into DFU, flash, remove power, remove the solder, then carry on normally i will try with tweezers. feedback soon homie :KEKw:. cant need an extra hand :KEKw: Nah its good i am finished. It Works so i wont touch it :thumbs_up: Nice to see what these look like these days. I made one of the original cases for the EV800 a long time ago Does anyone know if it’s possible to use to your phone or laptop, still waiting for goggles in the mail Yes, but it would require you to order more things, it would be more complicated to set up, and ultimately would be a very bad experience anyway Alright thanks, I’ll just wait"
Have you confirmed they're data cables by plugging them into something else?,"@DædalusFPV I think the FC is broken in some point, manage to bridge both and tried different computers and usb data cables only get message I get Unknown USB Device (Device descriptor Request Failed) . yeah, old phone and work. ImpulseRC doesnt detect FC when connected too"
"I want to buy a drone to practice, I have a budget of about 50-75$ is there anything that kinda stands out by those trash Chinese drones? Something that doesn't need to have cameras (so maybe it can have better in other aspects) but maybe has better stability. I will do more research but maybe some of you have a good recommendation for this price tag","not really. the cheapest drone that id say is solid is the mobula7 1s or 6 but those you still need goggles, controller, battery and charger for Yeah I'd prefer something that has the whole package out of the box ik If you want to get into FPV, $350 USD is like the *bare* minimum without buying 100% e-waste. Pretty much all beginner kits have at least one piece of electronic garbage in them, most have two or three $300 now bc of pocket You are truly better off buying individual pieces rather than an RTF kit or $315 id say. fosho https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639. If you're thinking about buying one of those cheap Chinese toys just to practice learning to fly line of sight (LOS), they really aren't good for that either--flying FPV is an entirely different set of muscle memory. You'd be better off buying the radio (Radiomaster Pocket, for example) and a simulator and practicing on your computer"
Is this while flying or no?,"Nah not flying, just on bench.. Just tried it with another battery. Exactly 0.7 volts off."
"Hi there, folks. My 2812 RGB LED strip from SpeedyBee is always on a solid white state. I'm using a Mamba H743 MK4 V2 FC with iNav 7.1.1 (MAMBAH743_2022B_GYRO2) and upon enabling or disabling the LED strip feature, the LEDs go on or off, but I can't program them to change color or anything, no matter what I program and save on the LED tab, they will remain solid white. I have tested the continuity of the LED pad to the strip DIN and it's OK, also there are no shorts. On this version of this FC there are two pads for LEDs, one is ""Mamba"" the other is ""BF"", I have it connected to the BF. I have tried the Mamba LED controller button on the FC as well and it had no effects, but this is expected since the LED strip is soldered to the ""BF LED"" pad, not the Mamba one. I have swapped LED strips as well just to be sure it wasn't a problem with the particular strip. I think the next step is to try changing the LED DIN to Mamba and try to control from the FC dedicated LED button, but I'm wondering if there's something going on here. Maybe I need to arm the drone first, or bypass the ""arm disabled"". Or maybe my internal LED controller is damaged? IDK. Any tips?",how much difference will the s of the battery make Too little and the drone won't fly. Too much and it will go up in smoke oh my god its vitroid. creator of the vitroid website. what would you recommend. I guess it depends how powerful of a drone would a 6s support just wait for the 75mm 6s. 12 motor
is a gps necesarry for drones?,"nope, only if you want RTH or autonomy also shoudl I stay away from f3 flight controllers what would you say is good enough H743 > F765 > ATF435 > F405 > F722 > F411 what the sigma. how did you type it that faast stay away from F722 and F411 (and all the F3 stuff) and be aware that the ATF435 can only run Betaflight right now"
im gonna use betaflight. its good right?. for stabilizatoin. or is it bad,what do you define as stabilization
the drone being still. also is the flight controller the most expensive part of the drone?,"depends on your drone is it one of the most expensive parts there's like. 4 parts on a drone. all of them are one of the most expensive parts ok. also whats a stack. actually ill search it up it's a flight controller + 4in1 esc ok so basically a bundle What all can GPS used for Yeah but what features would I gain from it. Like return to home or seeing the speed return to home, ardupilot, autonomous stuff. seeing the speed sure"

would it be worth it to get a runcam thumb since i already have the mount for it? or is there an absolute better purchase?,"runcam is good, but you need to route 5v from your fc as it doesnt have a bettery. id just get a secound hand gopro unless you have a small quad i am building a flywoo explorer lr4 essentially. so no battery would be preferred I’d get an old used GoPro and a naked kit for it, or maybe an insta360 go 2/3 the thumb has barely passable quality… depends what you need it for I guess i def would want the best cinematic quality for the price. i was kind of tempted to just save up and get the go pro hero 10  bones version rate my fit https://www.quadpartpicker.com/lists/clxthunpo0043qavgklcg2ces 1/10 and that one is for the props darwin fpv is bad. get elrs not tracer. you want at least 45a esc is say. and 30x30. speedybee is bad. that frame is good. that rx is pwm anyway. so it wouldn’t rlly work. camera is mid. batteries u want at least 1100mah 6s https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1254912786505662555. man. I even gave a whole list. :loudly_crying_face: oh right. but like. its inexpensive. and it would work here. is an exact list. ima list a basic 5 inch setup to build (including some tools to build) Radio controller - Radiomaster boxer elrs Goggles - Skyzone Cobra x V2/V4 Charger - Hota d6 pro frame - Source one v5 stack - skystars f405 HD2 + 50A ESC Camera - runcam pheonix 2 vtx - Rush tank ultimate 2 mini rx - Happymodel ep1 txco duel motors - xing e pro or xing2 2207 (1700-1900kv) battery - CNHL 6s 1300mah (id buy a few of these) controller and goggles batteries - samsung 35E 18650 3500mah (minimum of 3 required but id get at least 4) soldering iron - pinecil v2 solder - tbs 67/23 hex screwdrivers of your choice (1.5mm - 3mm). elrs is cheaper then tracer, that esc would blow up when you turn those motors on (to low amp and also just darwin fpv is dogshit), rx wouldn’t connect to that fc, would need adapter for fc mounting, that rx wont connect. and when i mean the esc would blow up i mean it would bc to low amp and im not joking on top of that they got a 900MHz antenna for it. lol tracer is 900mhz iirc. but ya oh. tbs is 900mhz. so your antenna wouldn’t work anyway. plus elrs rx come with antennas Tracer was like TBS's last ditch effort to fight ELRS ah. it’s not bad just pricey. @SJNJ007 if u wanna be cheap just buy the beginners list it’s around $300-$350. it’s in the faq you can also follow vitroid's suggestions. https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner ik they bouta buy a b6 clone anyway and have their house burn down. they cheap asf uhhhhh. ok :pensive_face:"
"how would it not fit in a 5"" frame?. doesn't an o3 and moonlight fit in the thing?","Rush tank ultimate 2 doesn’t fit in source one. Also a dual tcxo is just a waste of money on that build https://wrekd.com/products/flash-hobby-king-2207-5-1900kv-motor. what do we think guys that's probably the right play the thumb, even the thumb pro looks absolute garbage if you're doing any cinematic stuff. for freestyle or something it works I guess ICEAGE. the alpha with the sigma mewer grindset. your back unfortunately. I wish I had better things to do yea but ppl like it when they think they are getting the best of the best. and they said they wanted a lot of range (person i copied and pasted from telling them). but good to know abt the rush thanks it won't fit in the traditional 20x20 vtx mount at the back, but since it's 30x30 you can just put it above your stack if you get a lower profile one it wont fit with the FC listed, and I dont think the Rush Tank 2 comes with the little gummy things to make it fit on the FC screws. people also like saving money height might be an issue though yeah thats why I said it wont fit with the FC listed $8 saved for no effort"
thoughts on attaching my gopro11mini to my DJI spark?. kinda wanna do a funny experiment,It's gonna be REAL funny when it crashes. Please share the footage with us
is it not capable of at 130g payload?. i know that would be pushing it,"It is capable but won't fly very high/ for very long. I really dont think it can do that another question that’s not as wild. probably right. only one way to find out :zany_face:. jk i won’t risk it talking from experience btw. that tiny little battery on the side made it struggle oh ok. i like the blue btw I loved that little drone, it doesnt fly anymore I always wanted a spark....they were cute mine still flies well. my first drone too. still fly it today my uncle gave me my spark and it was my first ever drone, has alot of sentimental value so I want to get it flying again best of luck repairing it How far do you get with it"
like range?. it goes decently far but I haven’t tested it’s limits recently. i usually just do sunset shots at my grandparents cabin and fly around my house or places i go,it really is. kinda funny that i’ve never tried the gestures mode even tho i’ve had it for like 5 years. i should actually do that
"ok another question. For my gopro 11 mini, should i get like a lense cover just to keep it clean and unscratched when i crash my quad or go through dust etc?",Idk I only fly tinywhoops and I never owned a GoPro
alright. i’ve thought abt getting into tinywhoops and indoors some time. are digital tinywhoops a thing? because i’d rather not buy new googles,I use my tinywhoop to terrorize my older relatives but i’d have to buy the digital vtx + cam. :fire::fire::fire: yeah maybe that too. i assume i could make it work with my elrs TX16s might look into that at some point I mean it's gonna be like twice the size of the whoop :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: i also wanna build my own quad some time because my 5” is a bnf. yeah ik :face_with_tears_of_joy: I never really fancied building my own quad. Not really a lot of time and patience to learn. Although I should get a soldering iron for the inevitable fatal crash. The way I've been flying that thing recently
"Hey guys, if an RP4TD ELRS receiver pad shows 5v, is a 4.5v pad on the fc okay or does it HAVE to be a 5v pad?",4v5 is better because it powers from USB so you can run it on your desk during setup
So it won’t affect the performance of the receiver at all?,it's meant for that. voltage spec is 4.5-12v for the rp4 Oh u right. Ok cool. I’m building a flywoo explorer but custom so I’m making sure everything is perfect before soldering and yada
"For the FC in my photo, which pads would be best for the vtx…?. I’m using Walksnail avatar hd pro",uart 3 or 4 both have a vbat next to them
So vbat would just be whatever the voltage the battery is at gets sent to the vtx?,Sucks tht the hd pro can’t just use 5v. But alright I’ll use vbat most FC's will have a 10v pad. but not yours There's only so much room on an FC that small. 10V reg is a luxury
Ima be honest it’s in shipping I’m kinda planning stuff out first. It’s this one tho https://rotorriot.com/products/m10q-180-gps-module?_pos=1&_sid=b9aba95ea&_ss=r,"Yea, I guarantee it will come with its own 6 pin connector for you to use. If it doesn't I would be *shocked*"
Alright fair enough. Should I use copper tape for shielding? The original gps wires did. And should I ground the tape or just wrap it and send it?,Yea you should still do that if your build called for it before
Ok cool. Any recommendations for tape or would any do just fine?,Anything that's real copper
? https://a.co/d/02rP9FOJ,Yea that looks like it'll work
Cool. Oh and do I need to solder a ground wire to it or no?,"Yea, it's generally the best idea to ground your shielding, otherwise that energy doesn't have anywhere to go but back into the wires. Thanks, physics"
And I can use a ground on the fc for that right? Or?,"Yes, any ground pad should work fine Cool thx for all the info ok guys. rate my new fit. https://www.quadpartpicker.com/lists/clxtvgs8u003a96el7iqd2p38 don't cheap out on a vtx, it can make or break your experience 2150Kv on 6S voltage is gonna be *wack*. If you aren't an experienced pilot, highly recommend dropping that to 1750-1850kv That cameras kinda crap, those motors are too high of a kv, get a better vtx and get a ep1 instead of that beta fpv thing thank you guys!!. im joking.. Im never thankful. sigma bigmas like me never are.. awoooooo :wolf:. sjnj OUT there's some uhh characters in this server brand new characters. it's the summer wave"
If anybody is familiar with stacks is this pin broken or supposed to be missing?,"ok guys I locked in and my list now has +1000 aura, which in turn gave it skibidi rizz. https://www.quadpartpicker.com/builder. wait. thats not how it works. https://www.quadpartpicker.com/lists/clxtvgs8u003a96el7iqd2p38. also dont worry about the frame I got my own thing planned for it Get a 800mw vtx at least. I would get a 1w personally Oh I sure hope it's 3D printed Well there is what’s left of the pin in the plastic so I’m pretty certain"
what????. nooooooo. I would NEVER do something like that,"Only 3D printed drones have real rizz. No cap. On god.

RadioMaster Pocket. does everything u would need Bro tyars almost $300
what?. just buy a radiomaster pocket for radio controller. and your fine. as long as you get the ELRS version,Yes vro. Thats 270 total
what remote were u looking at that was $300. how $260?,"they're total. totalling just wait till goggles, batteries and chargers add in I already have battery tho"
then why buy a camera and vtx?. do you have an fpv screen?. ?. and also make sure to set motors to 4 on quanity so its not making the total price no vtx and 1 motor,I need a camera for the opencv Its gonna detect fruits on a tree to get video that is good enough for that id probs get digital oh i forgot this was u. well id still set motor count to 4 and up the video transmitter quanity to 1 for an acurate price. on quadpartpicker ok. otherwise id say it looks solid. but for ai shit id use digital Wait. Im gonn use a raspberry pi for ai How am i gonna connect the camera to the actual drone dude is putting a computer on top of the computer Im gonna be real. Grand prize is $500 and second place is $300. This moght notbbe worth it probs not. whats the max budget your allowed to spend for the contest. if theres not the deffo not. bc someone probs had a better drone than this just laying around Unlimited money. Iut of your own pocket yea. odds are your not getting first sorry. some ppl have way to much money/spare parts and time Nah i can. I know other people whove won the cobtests ok. then dont waste your money on cheap shit. and get quality parts. and spend time coding/teaching the algorithm
I have DJI O3 Air unit and Action 3. Which one should i use?,they are completely different Which one is just overall better
"Hello, Is it normal for the motors to get hot when I spin them up in the BF configurator?","you can’t even compare those. ones an fpv camera + vtx ones an action camera. completely different use cases. what’s you use case If the motors are only switched on briefly, they should not actually become warm. I spun them to 50% for about 4-5 seconds. or less They should not get warm in this short time :/. Ok something is wrong with my electronics then.... For the protocol they are not hot but just a bit warm. well looks like, im not the only person who has noticed skystar current sensor not working on this stack. Sad.."
anybody have recommendations for how to set up GPS in betaflight?. mainly the ports tab as gps doesnt even show up in betaflight. its connected to tx6 and rx6 on the fc,"I also have a skystar Stack, and could have a look this evening to see if I have the same problem. I have been told that is defo has current sensor. I was advised to double check the wire make sure its fully seated. So just to be sure, I made a new esc / fc wire and defo 100% seated and correctly pinned  in. Still nothing. ive had to email skystar. Hopefuly they offer solution or replacement. I'm not really enthusiastic about the stack at the moment, everything was somehow easier with my other speedybee stack. I purchased it as it came highly recommended in this group. TBH I've only had 2 flights on it and its done its job, however i have noticed a few things that are not working properly now. Should have just paid the extra 20/25 and got a t-motor. It does what it says it does on the box."
Why is your baud set to 9600? The spec sheet for your m10 calls for 115200,i havent got the m10 yet im just testing the previous gps to see if it will communicate. for the m8 gps i currently have its baud is printed on the bottom at 9600. and i wanted to learn how the ports tab works essentially cuz its my weakest point in betaflight
"How do I solder this wire tip? It has some kind of metal cup on its tip, that can be rotated.. Is this some kind of connector?","Well it has an LED. If it's getting power, that should be pretty obvious. That is a bullet connector. It does not get soldered. most likely not getting power then We'll call that 'problem A'"

You’ll need to get a few propeller diameters above the ground to get out of it."
"Echoing what Kerman said, you have to get out of the high pressure bubble of ground effect to test properly. Also, altitude control is 100% throttle skill, unless you're using some sort of lidar or sensor-controlled altitude mode. I believe there is a section in the manual that covers brick recovery. Have you made any attempt to update firmward?","It does tho. Bullet connectors sometimes have a small hole in the side of the cup for your iron, otherwise you can solder it like an XT60 They were talking about soldering directly to the bullet tip, not adding a bullet connector to a wire thanks!. it is, I'm not that good, even worse I'm nervous lol I was about to, I loaded the firmware on the sd card, inserted in, powered on then it got stuck. but I didn't flash the goggles firmware I had it once when I messed ip the firmware flash. If you follow the recovery procedure in the manual you should be fine yeah, I also asked on the hdzero server and they said I should do the emergency flashing"
UBLOX or UBLOX7? for gps,"The pinch uses a smaller pcb, so if it holds with the pcb most likely not, tho the lense seems like it is a standard 10mm lense, so if it holds with the lens it should be good. And the beeeye also seems to use a 10mm camera, but a larger pcb, so in some mounts you may have issues thanks. i want to get the tw pound cam mount and mount my vtx under the aio. but idk if said mount will work on the co3, and i know in the near future im gonna upgrade to the pinch anyways just for cinematic filming no. like. to record. or to have as goggle view dji o3 probably only as goggle view new gps came in, same cabling, had to repin 5v to another pin but new gps is getting power with the same cabling lol. ill try uarts after work but itll probably work. just had a dead gps i guess Yeah the pound will not work with the c03 ahh kk thanks. im trying to find a lightweight one for the co3. 533 has one but its for racing so it only comes in 30deg+. which isnt bad but i kinda want 20 But, on thingiverse there is lots of pound like mounts for the c03, and if you ask nicely a lot of fpv shops will print it for you. The mobula 6 2024 mount is about as light as it gets without going crazy yeahhh i have been trying to find them. yeah i dont want to go that light, bc its not durable at all. that canopy apparently kills cams. i have been looking for these on thingiverse but i cant find them. i looked up co3, co3 mount, etc Not true if you fly indoors and don't crash the quad under a threadmill. All you need is a little bit of thick foam under the camera fair but i am gonna bash it a little since i am learning. then i might go for it since it has 25deg. il settle for 25 but i really wanted 20, trying to find some on thingiverse thats 20deg I used a similar mount on my first whoop, you just need since thick foam underneath kk thanks. il double sided tape a lil peice of foam below the cam Yeah. But you could hold it with friction soon il get like a pinch or sum plus i can change the angle so i can try 40deg racing if i want. i mean it will basically be a race quad, since it has a dedicated vtx anyways"
Why would this make it a race quad ?,"im gonna upgrade to a light frame, 31mm props, and high kv motors. and usually freestyle whoops have aios w vtx but this one doesnt so i can use it for racing which is cool Both can use an integrated vtx or a discrete vtx apparently its kinda expected that you use a discrete vtx at races out of respect bc the integrated ones have a lot of channel bleed. or they are frequently not on the channel they say they are It's more so they don't overheat while waiting for the race to start But nothing is stopping you from using an integrated vtx for racing Bigger problem is AIO cameras tend to have really shitty video quality IME We were talking about a vtx integrated in the aio tho. The camera with a vtx are always shit Ohhh gotcha. Yea take or leave it its a huge weight penalty but im working with a bnf here and i dont want to replace the whole aio yeah on having a dedicated vtx vs not. ^^^ A vtx in the aio is actually lighter yeah thats what im saying. dedicated vtx is much heavier. like 2.5-3 grams heavier lightest dedicated vtx setup i could find was like 16.9 An f4 5a 1s is 3g without plugs (2.96g) add a tbs nano pro unify32 v1.1 that's 1g the lightest an aio vtx can go is like 15.1 thats another weight upgrade i gotta make And a diamond was like 3.7g i gotta get the tbs nano vtx So it's *not* 2.5g. More like 0.5-0.3g. More Like 15.31g by Mr shutter bug, and the lightest with an aio vtx is a bit over 14g by angry dawn, that being said it's not a fair comparison since there was a few places shutterbug could cut weight  (with for exemple a newer camera/aio+vtx) and angry dawn did cut down the weight in those places. Basically, there isn't much/any difference in the weight. Tho, an advantage of a discrete vtx is that the vtx not only won't overheat (if you get a good one), but also the durability is way higher for the vtx"
"while charging my battery, at one point the first cell measured 10.2 ohms, but now (later in the charging process) it measures 6.7 ohm. Is it the final ohms that is the most accurate? Or is it the peak that I should be looking for?. just want to verify","I'm looking at the Prusa Drone and I'm wondering if similar components can be sourced out that is cheaper, more modern, or more available. Or should I just buy the reccomended ready-built thing from the first-time buyer's guide here. I already have a Prusa printer to make the frame and some other components  https://blog.prusa3d.com/how-to-build-a-3d-printed-micro-drone_29310/ A 10.2ohm IR battery, that's impressive (Also you it's usually in milli homs, at 10ohms your battery would just melt mid way through the flight, but it's normal for a battery to get a lower IR when it is full) Depends on your budget. But fully 3d printed drones are never durable or great"
yeah I think I meant mili ohms. ok so I should be paying attention to the ir when its full then right?,"It has an old cloverleaf antenna and is showcased with a spec/frsky radio, probably spec but I'm not sure, anywho it's most likely crappy, get a meteor65pro/meteor75/mob8 instead if you want a tinywhoop (small quad with prop guards). Yeah, also, without knowing the capacity the IR is useless The frame is the cheapest part of most drone builds, its not worth risking the more expensive parts on a frame that will break if you look at it wrong 3d printed frames are also really heavy I figured, I'm trying to see about 3d printed designs just so I can more easily repair them if something goes wrong. I'll figure I'll try a simulator video game and connect a drone controller to a PC. Check out the Hachidorii V2 frame or the Fractal 75 frame (for exemple on a 1500mah battery under 5 mohms is exceptional, 10-15 is good, 15-20 is old, 20+ it's time to retire them). Well, with a half decent frame it won't break (like the moblite7 or the frames Emilia sent, also fractal has an unofficial warranty on their products, so you can call them if by some miracle you broke your frame and they will replace it)"
can iI use this antenna Lumenier AXII Duality HD 2.4/5.8GHz Dual-Band Antenna for DJI O3. as replacement for my walksnail avatar pro ?. vtxs ?,it's more of an interesting project rather than something you'd actually fly all the time. also kinda old
In the sim (lift off) my pitch is inverse. pushing forward goes backward and vice versa. any fix?,Does anyone know why when I move my sticks in receiver the drone does not move but my drone is connected  to the remote I am using a elrs system

Am I supposed to leave the antenna connectors exposed or heat shrink them...?,"oh yeah, in the fine tune. thanks"

Can someone plz help me?,Heat shrink them. It helps keep them attached. I don't think heatshrink can save that positive wire from falling off... They were asking about the ufl conx I think :slightly_smiling_face:
you sure they're not 2207?. You can get them from <https://shop.iflight.com/xing-x2208-2-6s-fpv-nextgen-motor-unibell-pro733> their own store and on AliE but 2208 is a really weird size.... You can either order those same ones from iFlight directly or AliE and wait for shipping. or replace all 4 and get a more common motor with some backups,The whole motor because the mount is also bent. And I’m from the USA
What’s the difference between 2208 and 2207?,"2208 has a stator diameter of 22 mm, and a stator height of 8 mm. I just received new Skyzone Cobra X goggles, but there seem to be specks of dust/dirt between the mirror/screen and glass the first 2 digits are the diameter, and the next 2 are the height usually. 2208 has higher stator volume than 2207, and with it I think a little more power and maybe efficiency"
But technically it should be fine if I have a 2207 with 3 other 2208 on my quad.. right?,Well it seems the answer is yes - It's very easy to open from the front and clean the mirror and glass. Solved! it'd probably be fine but it's far from ideal. I wouldn't risk it
What would the risk be?,"that motor will be  more powerful, so it won't be perfectly balanced. the flight controller *should *be able to correct it though, at the cost of potentially some performance"
Is it necessary to cool the drone (Meteor 75) when it's on but rotors are off?,yes. the VTX is what heats up
"so, always have a fan running when the drone is plugged the pc as well?","ok thanks. I am trying to configure my Meteor 75 for the first time.. Trying to calibrate the gyro, which is a bit hard given the usb plug is sticking out of the bottom"
"I am confused by the binding of remote with the RX. Do I have to redo the binding each time I power on the drone, or should it auto-detect it after the first succesfull bind?",It's automatic after the first time
why are my motors doing flicking. not spinning?,"give us details. what are you doing, what have you done. what size 2.5inch. 4600kv motors. 4s. they just having a spaz atm"
does it do it only when arming and not in the Betaflight motor tab?,receiver works. it won't arm. outside of beta flight. its speedybee stack. SpeedyBee F405 Mini BLS 35A 20x20 Stack you can try increasing the startup power in esc-configurator. try to avoid speedybee in the future
do i have to download speedybee app?,"this isn't usally stack i use where is the esc configurator <https://esc-configurator.com/>. open it in a chromium browser, betaflight closed and battery plugged in ya. its connected. with battery as well press connect top right read settings bottom right. ."
buttom right of what. oh. OH. fucking trying to read something. anything else?,I recommend you just flash it to Bluejay. bottom right flash all escs
do i have to change ESC?,okay. i click flash ya okay all downloaded. what do i do now
oh. if my radio on right now. its bad?. do i need to reflash my radio was on,if it went okay then it's okay
alright. so what do i do now?,top left increase the max startup power a tiny bit. set it to 1200 or something press write settings bottom right now try and fly. see if they twitch still spins & updated. yippee you can also turn bidirectional dshot on now
Is electrical tape a good idea to cover up the motor wires?,Electrical tape is great and it's pretty. Zip ties are also good Braided sleeve :chefkiss:
"Anybody willing to assist with a poor financial decision I made? I have clearance issues and need to know the best way to solve them. I bought a flywoo explorer 2.2 ""no fpv kit"" to essentially build my own. Got a walksnail vtx, elrs receiver, and m10 GPS, installed it all, it was a bit of a tight fit for the vtx and the back props look like they will hit. Anyone have recommendations?. I shouldve just bought the walksnail explorer",No it was all open field nothing close i meant that channels are set the same
"Ok, and the circular polarization?. See it's kinda impossible to have everything right and not get range unless you live next to a signal jammer","Just swap to a 3.5 triblade prop I wonder if he could swap the vtx and fc positions. chaotic evil suggestion I can't tell what size mounts are in the center vs back im guessing center only fits a 20x20. motor spacers so the props clear the board. mount the board UNDER the quad The description for the O3 version of that frame indicates 16x16 and 20x20 FC mount i'm gonna stop speaking We'll call that.... plan B. :face_with_tongue: :smiling_face_with_horns:. I don't know how the explorer works but that board also looks to be mounted a bit higher than it needs to be probs just gunna go for this Get one that's the same pitch as the 4"" props and it should result in almost exactly the same motor load"
amazon? honestly idc where lol,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVBGHXR5/
"bet thank you thank you. oh uh the props have the 2 screw setup, does tht work with these?","Yea they are adaptable, they come with little inserts oh neat! thanks, just wanted to confirm before buying. seriously appreciated Anyone with avatar x have any issues with the foam padding. Want to figure out if I should be some 3rd party padding"
anybody know what servo refresh rate i should be usingfor this menu?,"What are good websites that are free aswell as paid ones where I can get 3d print files for drones https://yeggi.com https://www.thingiverse.com on a flywoo explorer v2.2 I’d just use whatever settings it had by default i dont get the last beep beep on boot. i get the triple beep, but no double beep. with default settings"
"Usually that means your ESC and FC aren’t communicating properly, why do you think it’s the  servo refresh rate?","im just not sure where to start for tht, everything else is working fine and the motors were working before flashing inav I would check the diff of your betaflight configuration and put those esc settings in inav You don't have any servos, so it doesn't matter"
Does anyone know of a decent and compact ELRS receiver holder? I have the ones from RadioMaster RP4TD and a dual walksnail antenna holder that fits with the QAV-S2 (20 mm standoffs from JB),Cable Ties. :winking_face: but that looks ugly haha. and I wont tie the antennas down with cable ties. thats a dumb idea oh boy you should see my quads
"show em pics to me haha. okay but dual walksnail antenna mount should be a good idea to 3d print, shouldnt it?. nah youre exaggerating. that looks good imo. better than my goofy quad that is broken rn","Look at the ziptied VTX, or the GPS held in the mount by electrical tape, or the undersized camera I haven’t tested that out yet, I’ve just been trying to figure out why the GPS shit doesn’t want to work"
for what do u use gps. rth?,"RTH and position hold, position hold just shoots the quad into space and slightly to the left, and RTH just gets lost"
damn. and it worked on other quads before?,"I haven’t used INav on any other quad, but betaflight RTH has worked fine for me in the past"
Anyone who can help me diagnose what the middle 2 wirres are for and if its safe to put on my rapidfire module as a mic?,"https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/configurator/configuration-tab. Look at Beeper Configuration With an M10 chip, I also have about 20 satellites after just under 2 minutes. apparently without the controller connected, beeper was defaulted to SCREAM. fixed it lol"
After 2 minutes?. Usually I get 20 sats in 30 seconds to a minute cold,"Just a guess, I've never paid attention to the time. By the time I have the remote control and goggles ready, I can usually see 20 satellites."
"Hi, I have a problem with INAV, my vtx is darwin fpv cement 1W. the problem is that after about 150 meters I lose the video signal. Can INAV limit the power of my vtx?","Yes, inav does have smart audio, you need to verify that it is working properly in ports tab the vtx is set to smart audio"
"Why is Stick center nog exactly inbetween Stick Low and Stick High?. as in, shouldn't it be?. 1500 is the value with gimbals at center, so I would think Stick High should be 1950",Because if the stick low was 1000 you would never be able to arm because betaflight would think your throttle is up. oh wait I didn’t see the 1900. yea idk
"Hey there, did anyone try a vertical fin cube frame ? Like that one (one of the tbs source) cause I like the concept for racing in theory (more stable, better cornering etc), but I wonder if in practice it's actually interesting","I remember these, IIRC they weren't great for resonance because of all the different carbon joints. Also PITA to build Well, the harder it is to build the more fun it is, but also, for the resonance I don't think the carbon joints are inherently the issue, since rosser/kabab iirc said that basically the most parts there is in the arm lock and the more friction there is the better the vibrations (assuming some fairly low tolerance) Yea they're talking about static friction between plate faces--this frame has almost no surface-to-surface joints, it's all floating box joints where they meet perpendicular to each other. Besides, the arms on the AOS frame are almost square to maximize surface area, this frame doesn't have any of that Yeah makes sense. I'm still tempted to get one just to try it out No shame in it, build what's fun! Yeah, and the theocratically advantages line up pretty well with my style of flight I know someone in my club who likes the fox crooked frame. He says that it feels like it grip the air more I think it’s a cool idea and the frames are made of more thin carbon fiber making it easier for more machines to cut and because the pieces are vertical the frame is blocking significantly less air from the props"
"A little bit of water then dry with a hair drier, tho be careful to not put any on the electronics. Or, if you have some C clips, you can just remove the bell. Maybe be more specific ?","i dont know what information would be useful to provide A video, or what happened before crash, a photo of the solder joints i was building a drone, the motors were working fine, i installed receiver, gps, vtx, flashed inav, got the esc to communicate finally, and then 3 motors work one doesnt. got a flywoo explorer like base, no vtx etc, and was building off of it. i keep getting like issue after issue, either something dont fit, the props hit, this screw doesnt fit properly, etc etc, finally got gps up, compass calibrated, etc, just now have tht 4th motor not spinning Thanks for the tip. Managed to loosen it some more by wiggling and then turned it on. Seemed to have done the job. Surprised it didn’t damage it more. I would have been surprised if a grain of sand would have damaged your motor significantly"
"Should I just paint a conformal coating over my ESC and make sure that all the gaps are coated, or should I remove the heat sink and then remove the heat-conducting paste etc.?","The 3 beeps are meaning the esc is working, and the lack of the two beeps after means the fc doesn't talk with the esc its only seeing 2 escs"
which ESC is this?. like specifically,one moment. it SHOULD be this https://flywoo.net/products/goku-bs13a-2-4s-13a-16x16-4in1-esc. specifically this stack https://www.getfpv.com/flywoo-goku-f745-13a-2-4s-esc-16x16-stack.html. before it was only one motor not being seen. was just changing protocols and now only 2 motors/escs are working
were you the one with the broken pin?,yea but all 4 motors worked before. and i contacted flywoo and they said tht pin is just for CURRENT sensing
Could you read the bottom right here see if any of it applies?,The ESC was not ready yet. This can for example happen if it is playing a melody. Also a previous flash could have gone wrong and it needs longer to boot up than usual.  There are simply not more ESCs connected.  The MCU of the ESC is defective.  Try a different USB cable - sometimes they are not properly shielded and might result in such errors.  Make sure your radio is turned off while interacting with the configurator. Switched on radios have been reported to cause issues with electro-magnetic interference and thus failed read/writes.. the only thing tht could apply is the MCU part. but it was working yesterday and i havent crashed it or anything
BACK LEFT MOTOR 5?  PROBLEM CHILD FRONT LEFT MOTOR 4 FRONT RIGHT MOTOR 1 BACK RIGHT MOTOR 3. ????,"iNav always seems so buggy to me just gots to switch to ardu. but yeah, I have no clue about iNav"
Hey I'm looking into buying a DJI Mini 3  do I need an SD card in the drone and one in the remote?,what do you guys think of the pacer 2207 in 2080kv. they looks awesome but idk if they will perform. i mean murders uses them but hes sponsored t motor. they’re very good motors
ive had them. eh. they fly. not exactly good.. i flew them like... 4 years ago lol. old stuff. spend 10 bucks more and get some emax ecos or something. its like 2 bucks more per motor. so whats the verdict on these batteries? https://www.getfpv.com/cnhl-speedy-pizza-drones-100c-xt60-lipo-battery-1200mah-6s.html. shit? good? just ok?. its that or the rdq ones and the rdq ones are more expensive. but i already have rdq ones so i could have them match lol,"the speedypizzas are ok, I hear good for budget hmm ok. i accidentally made a monster of a freestyle build with 2.5min of flighttime and zero throttle control. and i have 3 batteries from what I hear they are great. I personally sadly do not own any pizza branded lipos What do yiy mean by ""not exactly good"" im saying its probably worth buying something better. but uhh... i mean they *work*. like there isnt anything *wrong* with them. its just mediocre. thats the thing with most of the stuff in this hobby. like its going to work, its just a matter of is there a better deal for a better product"
"ehm, did you try USB cable?",I tried the one pocket came with
"Should I just paint a conformal coating over my ESC and make sure that all the gaps are coated, or should I remove the heat sink and then remove the heat-conducting paste etc.?","Do not remove the heatsink.. I just run conformal under it till it flows out to ensure I've coated under the heatsinks, where applicable."
did you get the OSD and how its set?,"Hey there, I have a bit of an issue, I'm not sure if its because of betaflight or because of my hdzero vtx, but when I turn on my quad, it shows the Betaflight logo, then freezes there, I can't access the betaflight menu nor can I access the hdzero menu with my radio, the uarts are wired up correctly, the vtx is getting 9v, and it never did this before on my analog vtx, and it's consistent, I unplugged and re plugged 5 times and it still has the same behavior Also it's the first time I have the betaflight logo that is cut up And it's on a freestyle v2, I already updated the firmware on the vtx and vrx I did setup my osd and used the hdzero vtx preset"
yep. maybe forcing a powerloop without unplugging?,hello got a quick questin if i build meteor65 with this https://www.koptery.cz/pod-2205/gts-v3-0802-25-27k-kv/ and this https://www.rotorama.cz/product/dogcom-550mah-1s-150c will it be able to do some tricks like powerloop like if it will have that punch like the power
Do you have an Android phone?. I'm pretty sure the speedybee app can work with iNav. but it is just... not a great idea to use that app at all. even for Betaflight,"it can and its great for me. I dont use it on my quads but when i fly fixed wing and there i some issue you can debug it quickly but connecting to the board and seeing whats wrong (gps ect). I think only speedybee use it mainly but flywoo new board should be compatible with that app as well according to the website.. i wouldnt set it up using the app but for quick changes on the field it works fine iphone, i removed the bt module cuz it wouldnt connect and im just not sure if i should re install it or just sell it or smth"
also @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i think ive asked this a million times but i keep forgetting. What are walksnail launching soon. Is it a new goggles supporting diversity along with new cameras or is it just a new module that plugs into the existing goggles. Or just a firmware upgrade that enables diversity?,"We don't really know for sure. but most likely a module that plugs into existing goggles. like a whole new vrx for the goggles. that also comes with goggles if you purchase them new but it will be with the existing goggles x not a entirely new goggle. Or chance there is new vrx module with new goggles I wouldn't think they'd make a new goggle, can't do much better other than maybe fix the analog input issues."
seems like they just launched the goggles x so i dont think they'll launch a new goggles but just confirming. i might take the jump and switch over to ws. They are very tempting to switch to and every day i feel like i should do it but keep holding myself bnack to wait for the new drop.. Also this might sound a bit silly but if the current goggles dont have diversity but the new product module will allow for it doesnt that require diveristy wiring for the antennas? Or do they already have diversity capable antennas but they just dont support them yet,"when you open up the compartment where the vrx is. (two screws). there's just 4 UFLs. I assume you'd just unplug those, plug em into the new one. done would you upgrading to the new vrx as sson as the new module drops"
"depends on what's better on it right. I *think* it comes with a whole new chipset which is supposed to give far more range. so for that, yes. For just the diversity? I wouldn't","more range also means more penetration right yeah penetration is the main thing. range is whatever ye i agree. Any chance it would one up or come close to O3 or are we not there yet it currently already basically is up to par with O3 With range you can just use stupid high gain antennas since you aren't moving everywhere, penetration is more important since you can't just use 3 x-rays and a 50 turn helical. I'd argue the moonlight is already comparable to the o3 O3 is a little bit better than WS with penetration, but it's not enough where it matters for 99% of people"
not in terms of colour and quality i dont really care about those i mean more of penetration and range. I fly through reletivley few walls and tress and the O3 holds up well but comparing same sceneraio with walksnail looks like it falls short.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZwjKOdYZ-A specifically in this video comparing same flight path to O3,"dude. when the channel name is rimzler. i don't think i can take it seriously. and also, he is using the stock garbage antennas on the goggles I mean, I hate the image of the o3 so I'm not going to argue with you about the colors, but the range is basically the same, just use focus mode which is the main problem here. and there is no fifth antenna, that's for WiFi so first thing that needs to be done is a antenna swap Oh yeah those antennas are pathetic. Get some real antennas basically just buy two truerx x2-air mk2 and any system will do Plus DJI has some integrated patch at the front so it's not fair even if he had good omnis *nearly*. like super close Basically. Just get good antennas so its not as big of difference to the point where i will be able to tell obviously or even be bothered by an existence of lack of performance Even the best system ever will have shitty range if you use crappy antennas ok ok this helps. what about ws own patch. that they sell Plus with walksnail you won't have to deal with a shitty company and proprietary bullshit. It's crap not that great, only useful if you need it to be super compact I guess Get some nice truerc antennas which is why i want to switch to ws as soon as possible. But i didnt want to give up the performance of the O3 but it seems promising to switch knowing performance difference in small. LHCP or RHCP Doesn't matter so long as it's matched to the vtx. does the stock vtx antenna need ot be swapped as well Cause an lhcp talking to an rhcp will have basically 10% of the range Stock VTX antennas are pretty great on the newer vtxs. you want LHCP they make a specific walksnail kit for those Well, an omni on a TX doesn't matter much anyway There won't be a whole lot of different there. You mainly want good antennas on the goggles. Where the signal is *much* weaker But get the x2 if you have the money you kind of really want the x2 with how the X are right now ok what about the other 2"
What do you mean by that ?,"since the goggles has 4 SMA That's pretty irrelevant since you have no diversity for now, you basically only get patches or omnis so leave the other 2 stock having one really wide angle patch becomes really important when you have no diversity. i would Yeah but that doesn't mean the x-air won't perform well on them it means the x-air will be meh on them. and this is one i can actually say from experience sadly lol this is the latest vtx isnt it But also technically I could argue that if you want a large beam width you should go with some mx2 yeah the v2 is the latest vtx Cause their beam width is much larger"
"oh also I forgot to ask @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) but i know the O3 has this thing where when you power it on it stays in low power mode until it receives a uart ""arm"" after which it goes in to full power mode forcing you to run it with a fc. Does ws do anything similar?","also do you think its worth making the v2 vtx ""naked"" to bring it down to 14g. Its tempting but you lose the heatsink so im not sure if the weight loss is worth it. i thought about doing it to use the vtx with micros as well since you dont get them power limited like the 1s does anything that needs the weight loss that provides. should be fine on 500mW 1s vtx"
it cools down to safe levels afer flying or still runs hot?. i just thought i could a) have the overall weight cut becuase of the naked vtx or b) run it on micros to get the maximum penetration at a lower weight. i heard their 1s vtx had some issues with range and peentration butb that may have been solved in the newest iteration,personally my VTX gets hot fast. idk how it would be without a heat sink. like I can get to almost 100c in a minute before taking off just got to fly harder I guess
i have a question. so. i got 5.8 ghz true rc xair units mkII. and they wont go on my dji goggles v2. it looks like the MMX is both male. am I supposed to buy a specific connector with the air modules?. nvm i mighta bought the wrong one. fk,"whats just the most durable 5inch pack. that will give me good power over time. tbf i baby my packs so rlines shouldnt be that bad Tattu R-lines are very high quality chemistry, so you can abuse them more for longer and they'll maintain good power output. They are quite expensive though, and you can still get plenty of life out of GNB packs if you want to save a few bucks. I have several GNB packs that are on their second year and flying really well"
Does anynody know why my battery voltage would be looking like this in my display....? but configurator can see the voltage just fine? Supposed to be the second photo.,"i wanted to get r lines bc on rdq where i buy stuff they are essentially the same price. as well as dogcom. dogcom, gnb, and rlines are the same for 1300/1200mah 130-150c packs. in the case of the dogcom/tattu 150c All good choices. I believe Dogcom are ""higher binned"" GNB cells, so very good quality as well hopefully i have a little more money to spare.. im considering selling my 3.5in, and its charger and packs. and if i sell those, the insta360 go3 can go too. so maybe 250 for the 3.5in with packs and charger. and 250 for the go 3"
Should I buy the DJI Action 2 or the Flywoo Naked Gopro Kit? I am worried that the Flywoo Naked Kit will break very easily.,i vouch for klein. zero clue what model i’ve got. it’s orange tho. got it as a gift. i think it’s the mm420
What purpose?. and add the Insta360 Ace Pro to the consideration list,For filming cinematic freestyle videos
"Shouldn't crash much then right?. but also, if it's for cinematic-style freestyle then you can totally get a heavier action cam",I mean if I fly freestyle I will crash. My drone is 650g without cam and if I put a 150-200g action cam on it I think I would have problems with my 1960 KV motors don't think you would. it'd just be... beefy
better than gopro? fr?,"All 3 are about the same quality with the Ace Pro having a far better sensor for low-light, GoPro's just aren't the most reliable things ever okay what about Insta360 GO 3S those are fun too if you think the quality is good enough"
but the crispyness and clearness of the video isnt as good as the ace pro and action 2 because of the smaller sensor right?,that and some other variables
I assume its a bit better than walksnail moonlight camera?,unsure honestly. could be the same then I think i would go with Action 2 because its not that heavy and better than walksnail moonlight for sure. props are in my way thats why I want a action cam usually. if you're doing like. stabilization. half the time the props will get out of the way
how hard is it to conformal coat a 5”?,"thinking it might be fun to fly around in snow/rain, and also have protection for if i crash into a puddle"
really? how does it work,It's like nail polish. you just brush it onto the spots you can. so not on connectors and stuff. and for full waterproofing you don't really want to use connectors
"i see. ok thanks. might look into this again later. i have a related question. even without conformal coating, is it ok to fly my 5” in light snow. i would assume so?","no. a single droplet can cause a short and boom everything dead I’ve done it before with my DJI spark but that’s an entirely different drone. ok that makes sense, thanks for the tip"
Can someone please give me the Super Mario Power-Up sound for ESC startup?,"How big of a difference is upgrading the antennas on a pair of goggles x gonna make. upgrading from the almighty ev800d and was disappointed by the range and i plan on doing some long range freestyle it'll probably be better than the ev800d. but on goggles x you basically either get patches or omnis. if you want to do ""long range"" you probably want really good patches yeah not sure of how far out i plan on flying since i havent done it yet lol. only a dream rn. also when flying digital is there any way to tell how weak your signal is besides looking at the bandwidth. ive heard the picture just goes out which isnt very good compared to analog people act like that. like sure, you get a kind of better idea of when your signal will be gone because digital holds on longer. but It's still obvious where you have bad signal and where you're going to drop out"
Anyone recognise this reciever model?,"woah, uh, actually no idea for once just found  out its a flsky ia6c :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I have definitely seen that"
anyone know the binding procedure for flsky?,"huh, never seen that one without a shell. same as frsky. hold button while powering up. assuming it has a bind button xD yes it has :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: for those without, you ned to short some pins together... Reading the manual, doesn't seem like it's got a bind button. it's actually very cursed. > Supply power to the receiver. When the receiver is first powered on it will remain in bind mode for 5 seconds"
and on the controller i just choose flsky and set it to bind mode?,"Multi, Flysky AFHDS2A. may be abbreviated to Flysky 2A make sure the ""Status"" line says the version of the firmware of the multi module. not ""No telemetry"" or ""invalid selection"""
Am I still able to put it in bind mode?,"New model with the same Rx Number should be sufficient. the radio's transmitter module has an ID, let's say ""abc"" Rx Num extends that ID. Let's say that Rx Num is 4.  Thus, the radio's transmitter module presents itself to receivers as ""abc4"".. When a receiver binds to a radio, it remembers the ""abc4"". A ok. Thanks for the explanation. so if you create a new model on the same radio hardware, with RxNum 4, the receiver will see the same ""abc4"" as before I just found out that the reciever doesn't have a bind button, only a update button Yeah. that's why I quoted the manual"
Eh?. Are you confusing binding and connecting?  Binding is the process through which a receiver learns what radio to listen to.  Connecting happens when a receiver finds the radio which is binded to and starts listening to it.. Binding = joining a discord server Connecting = entering the server and chatting  if you want an analogy xD,in that case I mean connecting :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
This cable is kind of long Will it cause any signal loss ? Or is it okay to install it,Do I have to replace both patch antennas or one is suffice for better results Idk how good the stock antennas are so i cant say
"How much do you think will cost costum 3.5"" with batteries? (i am not sure how much batteries)","around £150 to £400, it varies alot from cheap shitty to holy ballz expensive parts"
Did you count in batteries?,"Maybe, increase min and max buy like £30 to £40. Again prices varies"
Just one question how can dji fpv drone battery Last 40 minutes or how much but fpv drone here is like 5 minutes?,"Dji use Lion battery which have a much greater energy density, they also dont draw +2kw when flying. Well maybe 2kw. But still lion"
Why normal fpv drones use those?. Instead use lipos,"Limit output power, a lipo has much greater output At the cost of weight and capacity Idk i got 150€ and i am not sure what to aim for. I have got good radio and good analog goggles but i got tinywhoop Just make an excel sheet for parts. Give you an idea of what to buy and how much How much batteries woud you reccomend 4s"
"I mean balance of those 2. But rn idk how much shoud i even get. 5, 10?","Start with maybe 2 - 4. That is like 10 minutes of flight Buy more if you want more, you can always buy a large battery and charge them while your flying. Im impatient so i have 8 for my 6s How much minutes you get from 8 Usually 3 - to 5mins per battery A good 45mins to an hour for my to drain them Thanks very much for help"
good stack?. https://www.racedayquads.com/products/draft-axis-flying-eco-f405-60a-stack?variant=40731261403249. what about this stack?. https://www.getfpv.com/geprc-taker-stack-f405-fc-50a-3-6s-blheli-s-esc.html,https://pyrodrone.com/products/skystars-f4-f405-flight-controller-and-50a-ko50-blheli-s-esc-fly-tower-stack-30-5x30-5mm yeah i know but these are cheaper for me. and the axisflying is higher amp rating higher amp rating =/= higher quality also is the happymodel ceramic antenna reciever sufficient for 5 inch get a receiver that can accept a proper di pole flying less than 1km away yeah but trees are a thing too
yeah. is the betafpv one good?. or like particularly bad,the normal non diversity one. with the ufl antenna I would get an rp1 if you don't get their SuperD
https://www.getfpv.com/betafpv-elrs-2-4ghz-nano-receiver.html. radiomaster?. kk,"i cant find hm in stock. if i could id jus get happymodel the betafpv one will work fine too if neither HM or RM are in stock yep, rm isnt either. rip I mean, it's just an elrs receiver, if it's good enough it's good enough there isn't a big delta of quality from one to the next (assuming similar specs). (and if you get one from real brands) i just wanted to know if there isnt like terrible quality bc its betafpv. of course"
should i lower YAW center sensitivity?. for me the max rates and expo feel very nice. i used the same one from TRYP FPV sim,"20A esc enough for a 3'' cinewhoop or nah. 4s Lower rates. Maybe some throttle expo around your hover point. But honestly hovering is a skill. Not easy even with a lot of experience, and no human is perfect at it Regardless of your yaw rate, if the quad is turning around when you move the throttle, that's because you're moving yaw as well. Nothing can stop that except practice okay. my only problem is hovering haha. this quad has too much power:face_with_tears_of_joy:. but ill practice as you said"
"How do I know if a camera has a build in microphone? I thought the Meteor 75 had it because SmartAudio was mentioned, but it seems to be an unrelated thing/used for something else?","Well, depends on the specific motor oh yeah i can just check What I like is to have the max amp*1.2. Or higher Smart audio is a protocol created by TBS to control a vtx. Completely unrelated to audio. It's dumb I know rather confusing. haha yep And you connect it to a TX port. Gotta type faster I can type fast but not laying down using a laptop keyboard But also it's not the only way an fc and vtx communicate since you also have IRC ramp/Msp+display port so saying it's a protocol is more correct imo. I'm using a phone, we are on a leveled ground nevermind I guess I can Idk if that's fast or not, I didn't do one of these for like 2 years"
Ok thanks for the info! Are there analog cameras for a tinywhoop with audio?,"It's the vtx that dictates if there is a microphone on or not, not the camera. But camera wise I would recommend the c03, it's light and the image is good (*when you are flying indoors, it falls apart outdoors because of the crappy dynamic range*)"
guys im trying to flash quicksilver on my darwin f411 board and i get this windows error when i click reset to bootloader. it disconects and dissapears from searchable devices. any ideas?,"why not just use betaflight https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyWhoop/comments/1d1tv61/flashing_to_quicksilver_wont_work/ thats what i found on it, seem other have similar issues. dunno, got qs on my whoops and wanted to try it here"
did you read that reddit post?. did u put it into dfu mode,yea hence why im asking. i get the same error when connecting fc in dfu mode
is that the correct target?. and impulse rc driver. and that the wire u r using is data,"i cant even get it to show up as dfu in betaflight. doing some digging and reddit mentions that if someting powers of uart1 it might prevent fc from going into dfu C03 is on the Meteor75 I think. Agree that it’s nice for inside but had some overly bright image outside. Open to upgrade suggestions though, as I find the Meteor75 plenty fast for outside and i do have my elrs receier soldered. kinda silly if it is the case but ill remove 5v from it and see if it works Well you have the ant lite but it's a little heavier. And yeah the c03 is on the meteor65/75"
Only like .5 of a gram it seems? Doubt I’d notice that.,"I said ant lite, it's 0.2g heavier. You have the ant and the ant lite Ah yes I rounded it up a bit but was looking at the lite (1.7 vs 1.45). I see the Ant is 2g with 16:9 The aspect ratio doesn't matter much, you should just fly whatever the native aspect ratio is"
"Different question, but do people always match camera aspect ratios in their goggles? My Cobra X automatically sets the view to 16:9, even though the C03 is 4:3",You can change that in the goggles. And yes always match both so you get the most FOV
"Why would FOV change when the image is stretched? I mean, doesn’t 16:9 create an artificially wider picture and therefore if anything a larger FOV?. Or is it cut off vertically?","Well cause going 16:9 on a 4:3 sensor will either fuck up the image or cut up part of the image. And you don't want either It looks like it stretches it and creates a bit of a fish-eye effect. Does make it a little more immersive I used some Cobra X v4, and flying in the right aspect ratio so it doesn't stretch it is much much better"
Okido. One more thing. The C03 (and ant lite) state 1200VTL. The Cobra captures at 720p (I think). But the resolution seems much lower in the recording. What is limiting the resolution?,The fact that analog is 480i (or 576i with pal). The 720p dvr of the cobra x is more so it can record what an hd VRX is outputting. But it also makes 480i footage look slightly better I have strange issues with ev800d when i power it by 2 18650 (8.22 volts) the screen just blinks but when i connect it to micro usb it Works
i bought these motors and its too late to return them now. the dimensions say M6 shaft diameter but all of the 3 blade props i see on amazon are 5 mm. did i just screwed and bought a bad motor?,"You just bought a really old motor. Most motors today use m5 shafts, not m6. But you could drill an m5 prop to m6 if you really don't want to return the motors. Tho it will affect durability"
Anyone maybe know solution for this? :D,"Yea these motors are *not* used for 5"" props, which use an M5 shaft. They are for 9""+ props that use a M6 shaft"
nah just big. what size props are you looking at?,"I mean, 2212 isn't that big old motor because they probably followed some budget video. but instead got scammed"
"hey guys. i just got my mobulis 7 and i have no idea how to bind it. can somone help? is there a guide or something . i used beta fpv and clicked bind and then bound it, i saw the stuff moving in beta fpv but when i disconnected it from the computer and installed a battery and armed i get nothing.. and ive never done this before btw... first drone.","The mobula 7 is a drone from happymodel, which has nothing to do with betafpv"
I replaced lipo for liion may it cause that to not work?,"right, sorry. get a screenshot of your Modes tab :slightly_smiling_face: my bad.. ok.. give me a second i jsut hoped on a different computer so i could relax a bit.."
"could you install the regular configurator for now? The web based one is still in very active development, can't verify that everything will work as we expect it to",ahh roger that.. ill get on it.. give me a few.
do you have the goggles set up to get video?,"no, the are arriving later today. i was going to try to line of sight it.... or at least get the props to spin Li-ion cannot output nearly the amount of amps that lipo can gonna need them to diagnose ok  cool ill just put it on hold they should be here within 2 hours. Thanks man. I'll have to be here in like 10"
do i need to load an elrs lua script on my boxer?,"until then, someone else will need to jump in its bound.. i can see when i hit the arm switch its doing it.. cool man thanks. Ohhhhh. So that is why it wont turn on. Thanks"
"I mean... Whatever you're powering should still turn on, it just won't perform as well? I really have no idea without more context","I was trying to power ev800d with 2 18650 and when i hold the on button screen just blinked. Coudnt turn it on Dude. The EV800D uses 3S voltage lol. Of course it won't turn on, it needs 12v"
it does?. ev800d only has a measly 1s battery inside of it,My lipo is 7.2v. And it turns on Wait or is that 1s. I didn t think it can run on 1s No that's definitely 1s. Hmmmmm intensifies I am cooked. I cannot read. I put 8.2 volts into it. :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:
The adapter input is 12v so I'm confused. Where are you plugging in your li-ion on the board?,As the battery. Not the cable Try only using 1 of your batteries I feel stupid rn :downcast_face_with_sweat:. Hope i didnt break it Me confused by external power input. :crossed_fingers: I ll go buy 1 18650 case and wire it monday and i ll see if it Works
Do you have a single wire? Just put 1 battery in your case and bridge the other side with a  wire,I want it to look nice. :D. So ye You don't need it to look nice to test it If lipo is 3.8 v so its gonna need to work. Gonna test it monday
How do you know they are bound?,I dont know honestly and I think that is the main issue
"I've seen some videos of the small fpv drones and what you see in the goggles, why is it curved?","Small camera with a high FOV. ""fish eye lense"". can always be corrected afterwards"
The ufl or the receiver boss?,"Two big pads and one small one, you can do it. UF.L connector"
"Thing is, it came off in a crash and I didn't retrieve it for atleast a couple mins. Wouldn't it burn out?","ah okay. wait is meteor 75 or mobula7 better It could've, but that's also a really high quality receiver and at least one side of it will still work.. and this is good practice. I'm guessing the non-pro Meteor75 is the best. Make sure you get folded cells like in #frequently-asked-questions"
I would assume it wouldnt function properly with just one antenna plugged in...?,betafpv sells the lava ones
And would these be the correct connectors? https://a.co/d/03lpz0cG,"You'd have to set it to do standard diversity and not gemini, and you risk burning up the one without an antenna.. Looks similar, might be cheaper on a site like Mouser or DigiKey I need it ASAP so I'd rather pay a bit more.. And having extras will be nice then get it from mcmaster-carr :p I'ma be honest chief idk what that site is lol. Anyways I ordered the ufls. I also ordered a replacement receiver as a backup if everything goes terribly. I'll just return the receiver if I don't need it. Shit has not been going my way man it says lava is just rebranded tattu, but it seem that the tattu one is more expensive don't think it is. Brace the wires with a zip tie next time. I do that for everything that I don't have hard mounted, it'll save you from stuff like this."
"one last question, the boxer website sells the boxer controller with either FCC or LBT, but on getfpv theres no option for that, which one does the getfpv sell?","FCC. since GetFPV is FCC. but also, GetFPV is probably the worst FPV store in the US. and there's a chance the Boxer there is more expensive than it should be. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623076796923928/1247237951113531434 its the same as on the boxer website"
What state are you in?,"canada right now but i live in texas Defiance is in Alabama. Pyro in California. RDQ in Florida if i buy it from getfpv and ship it to canada, will it be fcc or lbt https://rotorvillage.ca/ https://rotorgeeks.com/ neither sell the ev800d goggles"
Do you have desolder wick?,should be more than enough. just desolder the pads till no solder is left. then make sure the ufl is flush on the pcb and solder one of the sides. and from there it's simple
im going to assume you're asking if anyone has changed the connector on their mobula to a BT2.0?,":slightly_smiling_face: you deciphered my code. I BT2.0 swapped the connector on my Mob6, make sure to get the pigtail and not just the connector, saves you some work Do i need to completely desolder the existing wire or can i splice solder it to the existing wire. yes i got the entier pitail and connector... It's alot easier to just desolder the PH2.0 wires and put the BT2.0 pigtail on, because if you just snip off the PH2.0 and solder on the BT2.0 then you wont have the heatsink thing on the back. remember, blue wire is positive, white wire is negative hmm.. i gues i dont know what the heatsink thing is. sorry, heatshrink thing, the thing that covers the joints on the connector. its the plastic piece that acts like a heatshrink on the end"
ahh roger heatshrink. understood.. Has anybody ever done both connectors to it?. i have both types of batteries.,way too much extra weight ill just convert the batteries i guess.. the good news guys is im flying!. im so stoked. thanks to everyone for all the help.
Any way to confirm this? On OSD for example,"Yes, when disarmed the output will be the lowest output set in your vtx table This might do it, though I havent tested it so it may not update.. near the bottom of the OSD tab"
At what voltage are you supossed to land again?,For LiPo's you should generally land at hovering 3.5v per cell. not any lower
And your lipo is dead at 3.0 right?,"s eulbtdoes anyone now how to bind a tinyhawk 2 freestyle to a frsky taranis x-lite pro s eulbt your LiPo will start degrading under 3.5v and will drop *insanely quickly*. like insanely quickly. There should be loads of guides online, if you *just* bought that gear though I recommend you return it as that's all pretty outdated and a scam... i tried it but i did not work"
"Hello, is it possible to remap motor on mobula6?",Cool! I watched Joshua remapping but he has + - and signal and I have 3 black wires..  don't understand this
Huh?. you just do it in software. If you just need to re-order them you can do it like this. <https://oscarliang.com/betaflight-resource-remapping/>,"One motor does not spin. I need to remap it to different pin... Was the idea if the motor don't spin,your motor is dead or the esc is dead or the wires are dead Motor ok. ESC is dead . I thought remapping would help. ...To an alternative signal generator :slightly_smiling_face: you only have 4 esc's on the board Thanks for helping me! :slightly_smiling_face: on bigger quads you can get it working by adding a single esc and bypassing the broken one in the 4in1, but on a whoop it's just not viable. sorry but you need a new aio Weird question may i take off the Black cover from vifly whoopster the top on wjth text on it and only leave the see thru layer"
What preset?. Could you show the ports tab and your wiring?,I can't see my Betaflight OSD on my walksnail did you configure it following the manual I did all the cli commands and installed the preset
Is it cat hair on the solder joints or do you have some strands of the motor wires touching the solder joints of the next motor wire ?,I know its annoying to resolder everything but if I were you I would do that tho. I resoldered mine like 5 times till I got it kinda good
Voltage reading question: I land with my OSD showing a warning at 3.2V or below. But when I plug the battery in for charging they all show 3.4V or more on a Vifly Whoopster 3.. Is this difference due to power draw when reading the Voltage on the active drone? Or should I calibrate it somehow?,If i have a pair of analog goggles that has an av port am i able to output the signal from my goggles to an external monitor like the Hawkeye Captain X 10inch for example
So I been having issues with this skystar stack and the current sensor isn't working. Not reading any mAh.  Unfortunately no luck with skystar customer services.   However I had a thought. Is it worth soldering the connection between the FC and ESC to see if the current sensor will work that way?.  Or is it a waste of time and the connection through the jst is the same and won't work?. That's the stack.,the mah osd element just sucks. just use voltage. bc for mah you need to calibrate it and all that stuff It's for long range. I kind of need it.. It's also more accurate then the voltage. Once calibrated
"i had a little crash where i lost signal just above the beach and it fell on some rocky sandy area. the quad barely had any sand on it and i didn’t see any sand in the motors, should i be fine to continue flying?. i lost signal about 5 seconds into this video",How do I output video from googles x to laptop screen or even phone
"dam guys... i hooked the battery up backwards to my mobula 7 and smoked... but so its still running , my son is saying its flying wierd. i thought that is it possible for it to be fried and still fly ?","i figured it would either not work at all or work. yea.. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. stil flies .... oh well... the joy of fpv. if it flies weird then maybe FC, ESC or motors are damaged"
"I assume you mean live/streaming video, not recorded video?","I think your input device would need to support video input, so somethign like a video capture card just look at the components for  visible signs of damage and use a multimeter I think you could just hook in a stand alone monitor though oh well im pretty sure its toast. using the mini HDMI out from the goggles. need a mini HMDI -> HDMI adapter I think I need a capture card only if you want to input the video via/through your pc. I haven't tried it (do have the goggles) but a monitor just needs an HDMI signal. so you bypass the pc alltogether yeah monitor is easy but I dont wanna buy monitor just for this ah gotcha, you just have the laptop I mean I have a monitor but I cant always carry that around when I visit lost places and stuff like that haha something like this perhaps: https://any-cast.com/products/m100-wireless-display wait i think i have that. lol i got the one from chrome. @MailManNL does something like this also work https://amzn.eu/d/05g4wJdW"
can i use this as a replacement board for the mobula 7 ? https://shorturl.at/2haMk,"I don't have experience with these types of device, but based on the description it sounds like it could.. Bear in mind that you still need a Male Mini HMDI to Male HDMI adapter, as far as I can tell luckily i have that at home if you think you have sand in your motors. You can rinse your motors under tap water. just need to let it dry. or put it in a place where air is blowing over it to dry them out"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snrkf6FTwik&t=303s. This video covers that information. but in a nut shell.,"Top left 7:100 is the LINK QUALITY.  where it shows -64 RSSI this is your DBM value.

Are you going to be flying long range?,"Freestyle short to mid range Moxon is a terrible choice then. Stick with the stock antenna Alright I will do as you say Stock antenna is an omnidirectional dipole, moxons are highly directional"
And packet rates should be 250Hz right?. Good to know,"That is a good choice, yes"
anyone know whats wrong with motor four?,Unrelated to your RC link. This is the worst FC ever designed and that motor has no possible timer assignment. Disable ESC sensor and bidirectional DShot Make sure burst DMA is enabled in the CLI
Wanna ask shoud i solder on bt2.0 on all of my 10 batteries + drone? Is it worth the risk?,```set dshot_burst = AUTO save```
"talking about link quality. Is there a way to display VTX link quality into the OSD, or is that kind of useless since the artefacts are the signal itself of poor quality?","@V-22 is this -64 or 64 RSSI my Cobra X does show the VTX quality, but only briefly when pressing a button all right i did that. and disabled esc sensor and bidirectional dshot RSSI dBm of -64 sounds correct. Make sure you are using only the RSSI dBm OSD element, not the RSSI OSD element but motor 4 still wont spin up"
Go to the CLI tab and type `dma show` and `status` and post the output. What elements do you have enabled?,"RSNR, RSSI dBm value and RSSI value. and link quality"
Do you have a battery plugged in when trying to spin the motors?. Get rid of RSSI,"yep. motors 1,2,and 3 all spin up. but 4 doesnt Show your motors tab again"
RSNR value too?it doesnt show it i think. only symbol,9 is probably your RSNR
okay. is a higher value good and lower bad?,i made a post in #help-with-drones so ill post it there https://www.expresslrs.org/info/signal-health/. Higher is better @V-22 should I enable the middle and the right box too or only the left side I know already thanks to V-22 but look at screenshot and question. What does it do when I check all boxes. didnt found anything haha. i might aswell leave it like that you can have 3 different OSDs in betaflight. each box is for a different OSD. doing only the left is fine and what most do

Is hota meant to discharge at - 0.6?. Because i selected 3 amps,You should always charge at 1c. What mAh of the battery you are charging Ah sorry! My eyes seeing things.  Read it as charge :p. My hota does the same no matter what amps I select. Oh okey then its normal :) Ye I guess it does it slowly abd safely Ye that is good thanks :)))
Just curious how much would cost one?,"Yes, chargers have very small resistor banks to discharge so it's usually really slow. It's not about safety, they just don't allocate a whole lot of space for it. If you want to discharge quicker you can buy a chonky external resistor Nah its fine i am just asking :) Hello,  I updatet my betaflight from 4.3.2 to 4.5. and i wanted to Set up the Motor Direktion. But the Problem was that the Motors are not spinning. I had the same issue, turns out you have to turn on dshot bitbang ```set dshot_bitbang = ON set dshot_bidir = ON save```. And you also have to turn bidirectional dshot on. (assuming the motors bip and you get all 5 bips). If you only get 3 beeps that means the fc doesn't speak to the esc and the plug might not be seated correctly or the 5v regulator is dead and the fc doesn't power on anymore when plugged in. If the motors don't bip at all, then the esc might be cooked"
"A few dozen bucks maybe ? It's just a big resistor with an xt60 attached to it, not exactly fancy, its basically just a radiator","Oh okey thanks maybe later i was thinking for RC cars with chunky batteries You could even plug in an electric heater on the other side I am not sure what is that :D Gonna try that, Thank you"
Where are you having range issues?. what channel?,"no, just at normal range the video quality is pretty low. Whats interesting is that it looks normal before I arm the quad, but once I arm the video quality goes down and a message comes up that says ""frame rate set to 120"" or something like that. channel 3"
Maybe just for pocket battery?. Is it then usable,NO. don't put that thing in your pocket lmao
for what?. it's just a screen,I used the quest two with both LiftOff and Uncrashed. You just display your desktop in the VR goggles dispose of it safely. that thing can explode any second
"What would be a way to decrease signal breakup of the video from my Meteor 75? Not so much increase range, more so a more stable picture with less artefacts. VTX power is maxed out.. Should I change antenne on my goggles, or on the drone?","go in your basement, pull out an axe and behead it (very dangerous but very fun to do) Hmm good question. Will check no. stock antennas on the cobras are pretty fine in this case. linear and linear matched oh he has a meteor75, ok then my bad"
What would be your advice regarding channel?,tho he could get something like a viper menace patch if there is a spot where he looses video use r8 when there is wifi around. cause it is the farthest from the frequency of wifi so you don't get interference from your wifi
Copy. So I have to select a band and channel. What’s the difference between fatshark vs raceband?. It’s set to Fatshark,different frequencies dang it  I was about to send it
"Ok will give it a go. Explains why my reception in home wasn't that great. A lot of Wifi inteference on both 2.4 and 5ghz. One more thing: The betafpv site recommends setting vtx to 200mW, but it can go up to 350. Why not 350?","the meteor75 uses a m03, I use mines at 350mw without any issues, but it's most likely to stop them from overheating if you let it sit for a while like when you wait for a race to start, but it's also so it has a longer life time since you don't really stress the components by sticking to 200mw instead of  350mw Ok that makes sense. I did see the reduce power on disarm is on and checked it lowers it to 25mW when disarmed. yeah, but if you only fly indoors I would recommend you use the lowest power you need since indoors you don't need that much power in a lot of cases since you usually don't go very far, I like to fly outdoors too so that's why it's at 350mw on mines"
oh and the small red antenna on the Meteor: Is it sending signal over the full range of the wire or just the tip? I was wondering how to best route it,"just so they don't burn up as fast. it's  a monople antenna and if I recall correctly my one class on rf a year or two back it only transmits at the end but the rf basically wiggles all the way allong the wire so you would ideally want to have it straight and pointing up but eh, it's for an elrs rx, it doesn't matter that much. it will have 200x more range than a tinywhoop ever needs even if you make a knot  with the antenna. (assuming you use like 100mw or more output power on the tx)"
Oh I thought the red wire was for the vtx? I think it originates from the camera’s board.,"no, it comes out of the f4 5a 1s underneath and is for the elrs rx There’s also an antenna sticking out the rear from the main pcb, which I assumed was for the RX the vtx uses a dipole whip antenna. the big black antenna Ah I confused the antennas then that one is for the vtx and comes out of this board inside the canopy which is not the aio but the vtx here's your receiver antenna nah on the meteors they use a monople wire antenna. not a cube antenna a battery disposal place or destroying it. good Ok I did mix them up. Thanks they also do on most of the f4 5a 1s, even if I believe some do come with a cube antenna, so i'm not super sure if there are different versions or some thing. yeah both of the dead f4 5a 1s I kept use a monopole wire antenna"

And does the Steadyview (Mix) feature still work then, or does it switch to Diversity?","steadyview mix works. and yes, you should combine an omni and directional. if you plan on flying more than tinywhoops. go with RHCP antennas, otherwise stay with linear. if you want antennas that'll be the ""best"" get truerc x2-air mk2. otherwise prodrone.pl stuff is nice or get the x-air which is the option just under the x2 then under that you have the pro drone stuff, and for the omni get a singularity, an omni doesn't cost much so might as well go with a good one no. x2-air mk2 or prodrone. no reason to get the normal x-air over prodrone stuff"
Rate 1-10 how well i soldered Bt2.0. Did i do well?,"the vtx doesn't care about the polarization, the antennas just need to be matched Looks like a 10 to me :thumbs_up:. Thank You"
That is good to hear cable was short and the heat was affecting the heat shrink also i used tape with glue :face_with_diagonal_mouth:. What tape i shoud use for soldering what is Best against heat?,Pretty expensive. But thanks for suggestion
"Whats better for freestyle flying? Props in or out?. 5"" quad","props out, on every quad it's better"
May i put another heatshrink over it to cover it?. There is little bit of flux on it wont it do anything with battery?,Just push it back up. It's perfectly fine
May i put there a green heat shrink so it will match the battery? :D. Or better without,You may do whatever you want lol i keep getting a fail error when trying to update my erls firmware on my external transmitter on my tx16s radio this is the transmitter external unit i have: https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2021/04/12/happymodel-2-4g-expresslrs-elrs-micro-tx-module-es24tx/. this is the buiold i made Well that seems straight forward. You need to build first while you're still connected to the interwebs. *then* update via the wifi interface
Should I calibrate my Hota D6 Pro?,"they are very accurate out of the box, so no"
Anything I should calibrate related to battery?. Like OSD information about battery,"tho you should calibrate the amp readout if you plan to use it cause it's very very wrong out of the factory. to do that you turn it on in the osd, go  fly a few packs, note the mah drawn, you then charge them back to full, note the mah it actually drew then calibrate accordingly. you can repeat multiple times to get a more accurate reading. tho if you use a stack (so not an esc and fc you bought seperatly) it's often less of an issue, assuming you didn't change the battery settings"
yo guys i smoked my mobula 7 board. Will this replacement work ? https://shorturl.at/aG76G,"It sounds like some crunchy bearings to me, if it is you can basically ignore it until the bearing dies (motor doesn't spin smoothly anymore) and you either have to swap the bearing or get a new motor"
"just because the ebay link is long. https://www.ebay.com/itm/176425439394?itmmeta=01J1RBDC32XJ8HHD3HP3C7F8X5&hash=item2913c690a2:g:vqsAAOSwBKVmbQnr&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA4Jplst%2FupqSnvDigf9heSsBBiYxZis8%2BjDQPWwAMxg13qCdlCfvScFgnVShITy%2Fx4qSJajpIa02IDTVSrSVRs1lwkLdqDWg36nh%2BZkco6GtQ1wk%2FClLG7NMf%2FIlg%2BMs8%2BcGveoyV21q2HDBT5%2Ft8ymNTO0u4fI3wlr5hPPc2ER%2FkIWcZmpXp8oeZI2oOW35ScueH85GTXkZR72h2n8MiBGGEBieNzR5RNTPTx2nwz3zZd9z0%2B%2BYjpiuvggg1rlp4JBgzLPeL15bN%2FnN9wvUi9gpzhv8uxz8iPaBJ7cMgpVHE%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9zBtYuOZA. see, just make it a little less annoying in the channel.",https://www.ebay.com/itm/176425439394. just remove everything after the question mark
It's more of a generic EdgeTX question. have you set your external RF in your model settings to CSRF?,"Fair point, I am still learning all this stuff and it's a lot deeper than I imagined. I have. And I've changed the default settings in the hardware menu as well.. I downloaded what should have been the latest lua from the configurator and it's still stuck on the loading screen. Makes me think I might be selecting the wrong model in the configurator but there's only one Boxer option available. You need to do this first. Your *model* (the ones that are per-drone) needs to be configured to use the ELRS module. before the LUA works I just changed the external to CRLS, upped it to 921k, and still stuck on Loading"
You can check that by just idling the motors and see if the props sled tighten right?,"no. take off the props. spin the motors in betaflight I see the module name on the screen right above the voltage indicator. The hardware and model settings are set to external CRSF. I set the baudrate back to normal. Still stuck on the loading screen.. Thank you for the help, by the way. Really hope I can get this figured out."
"I accidentally ordered a 4 in 1 but i did switch it from multi to ELRS in the hardware settings.. Wait, correct ELRS version. My controller is on 2.8. Could that be the issue?",You can't. they use different hardware. you need an external module (one that plugs into the back)
"Oh, so my problem is needing to get an ELRS based controller instead of the 4 in 1?","either that or buying a module that plugs into the controller Yup I did and they all follow spin inwards format Okay, thank you. Glad to know I'm not crazy at least. Spin outwards is better fyi"
"yes. but also, you're severely overpaying by using Amazon. what state are you in?","RaceDayQuads is in Florida. Wrekd has a Florida warehouse. <https://www.racedayquads.com/products/pre-order-radiomaster-boxer-edgetx-rc-transmitter-choose-version> There wasn’t, but I did manually spin the motor by hand and there is a bit of resistant at a specific spot. Thanks. :thumbs_up:  that's really odd then, but yeah sadly the rough spot is likely a bearing thing e.g. a flat spot on a ball. especially that fluttering high pitched whine/""sssssss"" noise. really weird lol Thanks, I will check these out! Makes sense, I bought those 4 motors for $30 lol. Can’t expect too good of quality.. Yup"
"I have the pid set to default on beta flight if that helps.. Like default values. Oh, is a question this long supposed to be moved to the help with drones channel? I think it’s getting kinda long for a quick question.",you could also just https://www.racedayquads.com/products/radiomaster-ranger-micro-2-4ghz-elrs-transmitter-choose-version
I actually ended up initiating a return through Amazon and ordered an ELRS through Wrekd. Should be here tomorrow (kind of doubt that?) and I saved $20.,"It's probably better to recommend the BetaFPV Super TX now. Gemini, dual 1W for like 60 dollars"
I know telemetry literally saves it to the sd with some setup... but would this keep showing it on the radio or something?,Today I learned that ELRS has a gplus1 scrpt to give you last know coords of ur quad if it has gps. neat I think you can display all this with the iNav lua script.  This should also work with Betaflight.  https://github.com/iNavFlight/OpenTX-Telemetry-Widget for me yes. if ur asking about the telemetry gplus script. literally just showed on the screen the last cords and the gplus code. super useful as im building and configuring a custom flywoo explorer. i am on inav tho if tht matters
where can I find it? I would like to not have to find the last coords on an sd card everytime I crash... especially since I'm gonna be flying over water where it'll move pretty quickly so it'll be elswhere by the time I do that,"so this was pre installed on my zorro elrs controller. i just went to the telemetry screens through the MDL button. so page 12/12. and then instead of setting up a screen u set screen to script. and then to the right it just gave my gplus1. and tht was the only script it had, but it was pre installed. this is on latest edgetx and latest elrs fw and latest sd card install from edgetx. ymmv"
Any setting in beta flight that can be adjusted to five more power to a weaker motor?. It somehow have the pid tuning to adjust for that?,"No.  The PID controller will compensate for the weakness in flight, but it's not ideal"
Doesn’t the battery’s position influence the center of gravity quite a bit?,"Oh it was @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) I don't own the meteor75. But it doesn't matter how far you push the battery so long as it is secured in. Since during the flight it will wiggle a little anyway, you just need to make sure it won't come out of the little holder You won't feel the difference"
"wow, thanks Tydude2641, I tried that gplus script and it worked. but now that I have a gps coordinates  numbers on my radio, what now?  I mean, where exactly do I typed the gps coordinates to track down my drone ???. I tried typing my gps coodinates into google search, but nothing came up.","you must type the gps coords or the GPLUS code EXACTLY as its formatted each space, each comma, minus, etc mine worked fine, showed me my location with both gplus code and coords here  28.784637, -81.356349  thats proper formatting  XX.XXXXXX, -XX.XXXXXX the minus is just cuz of the location for me, yours may not have   - if you copy this and paste into google you should see an orlando marriot hotel   28.784637, -81.356349  76WWQJMV+VF thats the gplus code from the gps coords for the same location hope this all helps! any FC will support ELRS as long as it has a free RX pad. even old F3 shit"
what external module do I need for the Googles X when I want to use analog?,"Look up the BDI Digidapter or any other analog module adapter that uses the same output Having a problem with my crux. It shakes pretty bad whenever I go fast. Makes it hard to fly. What could the cause be The props and motors are on securely Throttle PID Attenuation (TPA) is my first guess, might need to turn that gain up a little. You might also have some resonant frequency that needs a specific notch filter (seems less likely to me based on your description) I've taken this Cruz flying like 3 times now ans today it's doing this for the first time If it was fine before, it isn't now, and you haven't changed ***any*** configuration or tuning, then there's something mechanically wrong Im gonna buy dji mini 2 se my question is how much weight can it bear attached to it and still fly"
"Hello, I just bought a TBS Unify Pro32. Do I have to use both grounds, or can I cut one off?",30 grams. You can twist the video wire with the ground wire next to it to provide better noise rejection performance. I would keep it.
Okay so i just solder it on an other pad on the fc. And for smart audio i only need to use 1 cable i think the sa / crsf rx  to tx pad ?,not much and if you can just buy a dji mini 2. its much better. the SE is kinda the stupid step child. get it refurb or smth cuz they dont sell the 2 new anymore (well they do but under the 4k name) I wanna be able to like attach boxes of food to it and fly unless its like a few pieces of candy no. you cant do that sucks. but fpv rc cars can do that right depends on the car. or just build an rc plane cuz that can carry way more weight
"Can you rebind a elrs rx to a new controller? For example can I build a drone that I bind to my controller, test it and send it to the owner so he can reflash it to his controller?",yea. or you can just change the binding phrase to the owners before you send it out. so its already paired A yes that's even better Pull the props and spin the motors up. And inspect your props/ try fresh ones
Even this FC? :slightly_smiling_face: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005006809174441.html?src=google&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=272-267-0231&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&gclsrc=aw.ds&albagn=888888&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=272-267-0231&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&gclsrc=aw.ds&albagn=888888&ds_e_adid=&ds_e_matchtype=&ds_e_device=c&ds_e_network=x&ds_e_product_group_id=&ds_e_product_id=nl1005006809174441&ds_e_product_merchant_id=538391995&ds_e_product_country=NL&ds_e_product_language=nl&ds_e_product_channel=online&ds_e_product_store_id=&ds_url_v=2&albcp=20701318733&albag=&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJZu_7CUxYVpC966ho4PlMpKbK18A53tQ9nwN9fy2K6uxqAQh69vrZhoC1lAQAvD_BwE&aff_fcid=c51643bf5fdd481f99285c9a451c18f3-1719947214340-07692-UneMJZVf&aff_fsk=UneMJZVf&aff_platform=aaf&sk=UneMJZVf&aff_trace_key=c51643bf5fdd481f99285c9a451c18f3-1719947214340-07692-UneMJZVf&terminal_id=05d21f4018e94339a3b4646d30679d0a&afSmartRedirect=n#nav-specification,"this link sould do the same https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005006809174441.html. yes, that FC should still work what is this link :loudly_crying_face: longer than whole wikipedia So I can use these pads tx/rx1 ok great. last time I offer someone to help gettting his ancient quad in the air :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"

Hey guys. I am a bit new to drones and is an E525 drone a good way to start?,"Toys like that are very rarely worth spending any amount of money on if you want an *actual good* drone Im not trynna get the best drone out there but just a decent one that I can use from time to time The problem with these toys is you're only going to use them a few times before they break. They really, truly, deeply suck. Even if it's something you only pull out now and then, if you want to have a good experience, you should look at spending a couple hundred on a used dji mini something Oh okay, thanks for the help"
Is the battery fully charged?,It was blinking up to four indicators before it just turned off. I'm not sure whether that's the sign it's fully charged.
"Hello, I got my Mobula 7 1s today and I tried putting in a 1s battery from my mobula 6 1s but somehow this doesnt feel right. Can this work? I will change the connector to A30 (BT2.0).","As long as the powerbank has a battery, there will be no problem. I use my hand warmer as a power source :KEKw:"
But would that still work with 300mAh?,the mob7 is meant for larger 450mAh batteries the battery won't be held as securely. but it will fly
"How do I make my lipos discharge faster for storage? My Hota D6 Pro only does -0,2 Amps. Thats lame and takes for ever.",You buy an external big boy resistor. And solder an xt60 to it. And add a fan to blow on it so it doesn't catch fire
Bruh I dont want to destroy my lipos?. I want to storage them. Getting 4V to 3.8V takes ages with -0.2 Amps,"You discharge your lipos at 100A sometimes, they won't care about getting discharged at 1-2A"
Oh so it only discharges ddm at 1-2 Amps? You mentioned a fan and a fire and it sounded like its hella dangerous and will discharge at 150C-300C or idk haha. So Hota D6 Pro is trash at discharging fast?,"It's just that the resistor banks inside of our chargers are really small so they can't discharge very fast. They are more made to charge Nah, it's just that just a few amps over a long time can make stuff really hot (especially when it's going through a resistor that is only here to transform the amps into heat) Then I might aswell wait till it stops raining and then fly full speed for a few secs so it gets under 3.7 and then Ill do storage Leaving them full will damage the cells. Not a lot but if you do it repetitively it adds up I charged them around 10 hours ago and I wanted to fly today but now its colder outside than I wanted and I wanna fly tomorrow so I wanna discharge They won't care if you leave them charged overnight once or twice, just don't make it a habit or they will have a much shorter shelf life Wait cant I just take the props off and then do 50% throttle or idk to discharge the batteries faster than Hota D6 Pro"
do they need much air to cool down?. I have a leaf blower that I can use,Yeah. Connect the battery to the leaf blower at that point
haha. How do I prevent my VTX from overheating when I crash? That thing gets to 90+ degrees in a extremly short time when there is no active airflow. I have Walksnail Moonlight,You set the disarm switch so it also makes the vtx go to 25mw or maybe even pit mode when you disarm. But pitmode is a 100% guarantee you will loose video since it's either no video or 1mw
"I want to make it go to pit mode. I mean I can still flick the switch back and then I get video again, wont I?","Yup. But it will arm the quad. So you would need to have it on another switch I have many switches available But then you will need to hit both when you crash. Then have one switch that makes the vtx go to 25mw/pitmode Ill just use SA and SB switch for it. SB has 3 positions Tho, you will need to remember to use it every time you arm so you have more than 25cm of range"
should I aso do this?,Oh yeah there is that too. Forgot about it. Should do about the same thing
btw whats that. ok so no need for pit and 25mw  bla bla?,"I would assume it means it will select the 2nd power level of the vtx when disarmed. If you enable it yeah. Also, if you use a digital vtx it might not work btw when I fly my googles show 25 MBPS. I want more than that. my dji avata 2 has 60 MBPS if  no interference like a building in between me and the quad. If you use walksnail you need to select the wide band or high bit rate iirc Also, for the lower power on disarm, you might be able to do that in the goggles, I'm not sure betaflight can tell the vtx to go at X power level by itself i guess ill try that out rn if i arm my quad and disarm it if it shows low vtx power or idk it says standby bow, low rf power. bruh it stays at 1 MBPS haha. and still gets hot af. okay maybe i need to fly and not just do 10% throttle Yeah that's normal, but electronics can sustain a lot more heat than us. Cause pit mode"
Are these types of brief (sub 1 sec) colored bands normal for analog tinywhoop cameras?. trying to improve the video quality where possible,"Might be the best you'll get, this id imagine is just signal interference. Making sure your goggles are tuned properly, adjusting cam setting, upgrading antenna or camera might help."
"Right!?. I am trying to understand how this can show in the sensor. I thought a reflection in the lens perhaps, but from inside the camera somehow.. And understand if this is a common thing or a defect","I’ll try to capture it. @HappyFishMan Top right in purple that's funky looking. lol. iirc the only way you can improve analog video is by having a better receiver, being lucky with your surrounding and channel. and having a good vtx that is isolated from the ESC"
"For isolation, I could put a little sheet of aluminum foil covered in tape and soldered to ground in between my power wires and the vtx?",https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/99302/what-is-causing-this-ghostly-image-of-a-circuit-board-to-appear-in-images-from-m. Light leaking from the back. Possibly something isn’t sealed properly.
Why not use a BMS with a phone charger for lipos?,"Because that's almost what our chargers are, but they can output way more power and can adjust the voltage and stuff, basically just use a normal charger if you wish to not have the 4th of July in your room"
The thing is I have a cousin who drives RC cars and he has only 2s batteries and noting else. So for smn like him won't a BMS do the job?,Get a toothstor instead of trying to kill yourself I mean. IV used BMS before for projects other than drones. Like I have some experience with them
In the ports tab did U turn on a tbs smart audio or a tramp on?,"i have the walksnail moonlight Yes it should be working okay imma take off props for safety first Ur prolly in pitmode. Try with the enter frequency That's only for analog. It has no effect on digital VTXs oh. thanks. then Ill disable the OSD element No, like the entire VTX tab. Anything you set there has no effect on your digital VTX so settings in the VTX table also dont matter. ahh thanks for telling me. I was sitting there and doing stuff and in the end it doesnt even have a effect because I am digital hahaha @NikkoYatt I suspect the 25mW is only when disarmed. Your setting for Low Power Disarm is On until first arm"
@Vitroid how can I prevent my VTX overheating in a crash? I mean this thing overheats pretty darn fast when there is no active airflow. nah it even says when armed,"but Vitroid said it doesnt matter. its only for analog. not for digital Not sure, I don't have Walksnail"
you disarm in a crash right?. it goes on standby. and it has heat protection,okay thats good. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) can I get my RSSI to positive numbers or is -20 to -25 good when quad is near me. with near me I mean like 5 meters. how can I even get better values wait my OSD is correct its only 25MW because I checked footage from a few dasy ago and it was at 100MW. @Vitroid so something is wrong
Are you sure you didnt enable the tx power osd element?,i didnt change the osd
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/819204824544837672.gif?quality=lossless&name=peepoleave&size=48. I rest my case. There is no V for Video in that description,"I was checking footage on playback feature and it said 100MW and now its 25MW Your transmitter is set to 25mw now then there are helpful tooltips for everything. that's for your radio The goggles Betaflight elements don't work. Walksnail hasn't implemented them. just use the bottom left ah yeah I see now. VTX is videotransmitter and TX is radio. I get it now nah I didnt change OSD for real but I remember turning on dynamic power on my radio. I am just stupid and making problems out of nowhere lol Someone turned on that osd element The ""I didnt change"" was refered to the last couple of days I was flying around and changing stuff in Betaflight xd. I was doing some PID and Rates tuning"
"In yalls opinion, would this be too much overhang for the straps? Or would it be fine?. The battery is definitely secure I’m just worried if the overhang will get caught?",Please please help im trying since hours tryp.doesnt recognize my betafpv controller
are you sure your cable inst just a power cable?,of course im sure its roiginal this has to be something more complex i read something about updating but i cant open the cool viewer file if this is actually the problem which i dont believe im trying since hours with chat gpt. i would need an expert for that. i mean the controller is recognized. but the sticks when i click set up or callibrate they are not recognized even though they must work because the light switches from red to blue if i move the left stick down after turning the controller on. there is also no number fpr support or sth. i quess i have to buy a different controller because this obviously wont work steam also tells me to configurate or set up the controller but there is no A button like on a xbox controller. im really starting to hate this all i am trying to play this game since days
@Hollyfut did you try idk using a different cable?,its originalk cable. i can try but thats for sure not the case Can I charge a lipo using another lipo and set the mode to external discharge on a Hota D6 Pro
ok so the game recognises the controller and you choose it but its not working?,"and then it doesnt findwhen i have to move up down. yeah like i said it seems i have to try a different controller and send it back ehm maybe, try checking if it works with FPVskydive its a free sim on steam. if not, its possible you do have a defective controller here. i dont thinks its defect. i can turn on and yeah. well ok i try. did you read what i wrote above please scroll up a little"
maybe its because i cant set it up on steam because it doesnt have an a button? it tells me to click a but the controller doesnt have a but well in the game its recognized anyways. ok i download skydive now,let me know if it works there or not but the controller isnt broken for sure i also didnt get what the setup button and bind button on the back are for the setup button got stuck already. yeah i try now. i also tryed what chat gpt said chat gpt is awesome but also cant help there lol I doubt chatGPT has enough knowledge in this very specific niche hobby
"no not working. well it can help a lot if you ask the right question but doesnt matter right now i finally wann aplay :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: im rly short before just givin up lol and i didnt even start. but the controller is not broken i dont believe that. can it be that its not working with steam like i said before steam doesnt let me to callibrate or set up the controller its in german ""einrichten"" i think proper translation is set up in that case. its tells me to click a which is obviously not possible becasue it doesnt hvae an a botton. maybe it doesnt work in game because i havent it it up in steam?. my xbox controlelr works by the way. also im not sure if i have to update the controller or something or if i have to click setup or bind at the back of my controller or is this jsut for when you have a drone no idea",well I was able to use both an xbox and a boxer radio on FPVskydive in steam. all I had to do was keep the cable connected. (for the boxer radio). look up the name of the controller on youtube you might find something there
so this here downt matter?. no theres nothing usefull,"I never did that, so I don't think it matters"
i dont know what else to do. ok. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paigGHOYbEg   i anyway dont know what the hell these youtubers are talking about anyways i dont even have the tabs and dont know how to download this configurazor would be interesting to check if it reacts to my stick. https://github.com/BETAFPV/BETAFPV_Configurator/releases   i really dont know what to download and how,"the software. its called betaflight the thing he is showing on screen. at first ok anyways i really dont have a clue well I wish you luck I don't really know how to help you, maybe someone else here would be able to yeah thanks anyways but i doubt it. wait i think the us was broken. let me check. because the keyboard didnt work there but how the fuck can it recognize the controller then at all weird wait. no not working"
"which exact controller is it. and what CPU have you got in your PC? (yes, I actually need to know that)","works what the fuck XD weird i have to turn the controller of like i read 2 or 3 hors ago but i  tried that before maybe i tried it wrong or the usb port was damaged but anyways i have to turn it off like sb on reddit said. nothing to do with cpu like i said i fonally found out XD. :slightly_smiling_face: welllll. tell me the CPU anyway. just gonna tell you something in case it's AMD lol well, whatever Basically, BetaFPV f*d up something somewhere and with newer firmware, their controllers sometimes don't work on PCs with AMD CPUs"
ryzen 5 3600 i think. ok maybe this is why you have to turn it off well i dont know but anyways it should work now and i think i have to choose mode 2 right? its the best for tryp? so im very curious how i will do in flying finally :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,well i try now :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: finally i come back later and thank you anyways It's possible that it's just random on your PC. due to it being AMD. assuming you're plugging in the controller directly into your PC what the fuuuuuuuuuck I have no idea how they managed to do that :face_with_tears_of_joy:. some sort of incompatibility with the AMD root USB hub prolly
shouldn't it just be an HID or Serial device?,"Well yes, HID, but their USB implementation is probably dogs***. they may have some timing wrong somewhere, idk. or some subenumeration.. whateve literadio never fails to disappoint with stupid shit like that truly. > literadio never fails to disappoint"
"idk what MCU they run, but shouldn't most STM32 ones have native USB?","f* if I know :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. looks like it's working. invert switches are for cases where, for example, you move a stick left, but on the screen it moves right Yeah now it works butnsometimes it switches it up its weird man. Yeah i know invert yeah i changed the throttle to invert better fornme uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. well that'll be a doozy to set up on a drone later"
I just tried flying first time with correct setting what the fuck its really so hard to hover like also in reality it doesnt stand on one place?? Damn i dont think im able tonfly that lol. Yes it was up was down. But injust realized its easier to also invert the pitch,"ah, I thought you intentionally made it so up was down xD Ok im already better i think this will be fun. No up was down but pitch is better fornme when i go up tht drone moves down like rolls down :upside-down_face: ok i play now finally took me forever lol see u later. Hmmm somehow i cant stand on one point it always moves forward to pitch it back works anlittle but not rly keeps moving forward. Somehow this game doesnt properly work when you yaw younshould just move left but it makes a roll suddenly damn hate it"
Yes sure or is norml i have to roll with the right stick the same amount then it works is that normal??,no clue what's happening to you
If not i cant continue because im learning wrong muscle memory then. Is that ordinary? Im trying the other free game now,idk what's happening to you can't understand from your desc
What can younnot understnd?. Like if you want to spin in a circle horizontalle do younalso have to roll the same amount withbright stick like keft stick?,idk which one of us is more drunk No the free game also doesnt work
if you do a 360° rotation while staying in one place. do you get back to where you where?,LR3 + AMD :slightly_smiling_face:. BetaFPV :red_heart:
I dont know what you meannlike i said i also have to move thebright stick same amount then. Lr3?,you still didn't tell me which exact radio you'ev got so I assume LR3 Its not that it was also issues with xbox controller LR2 SE and LR3 are fairly similar. hmmmmmmmmmmm. then idk. never had issues like tehse
Man why im cursed always technical issues i hate PC IT STUFF. I just wanna have fun now you still didnt tell me if you fly a drone and yaw dies it just spin in a circle??? Or donyoubhave tonuse the right stick for tht as wel???,"the answer to that is stupidly complicated because of camera angles :face_with_tears_of_joy:. if you watch the drone from the outside, then it just yaws, relatively to its up axis If your camera was pointing flat, straight ahead, you'd only need yaw to make the camera view yaw.. Since it points upward a bit (or a lot in some cases) you need some roll as well to make the view yaw I cant believe that shit :person_shrugging::smiling_face_with_tear:. Sorry can you rephrase that i coulent really follow I'm fuxxing around in Velocidrone ATM, have a look at the stream if you want (voice 2) I've got my stick inputs showing at the bottom of the screen Im out of the game it still does screenshots hahhaha :smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear::smiling_face_with_tear::face_holding_back_tears::face_holding_back_tears::face_holding_back_tears::grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/829872262311837756 Hinetly i rly hust wanna fix that right niw and finally play :face_holding_back_tears:. Im way to bad :grinning_face_with_sweat::face_holding_back_tears: i tried half an hour get theough that door still not"
"Bought a new C03. But is there a chance the resistor could be replaced? I can’t find a diagram so don’t know the type. Seems like a surface mount resistor, but no code on the image","It's a resistor. And if it breaks it's very likely that it either cut the circuit or downright fried everything on the camera if it was in parallel I mean, if you found the resistance you could but I doubt it will make it come back Camera is still working so I suppose I could still measure it. In other words. I suspect the resistor is still functioning."
"Can anyone recommend me high pitched props for 5"" freestyle quad?","Hq v2s. Or napal n1. Lots of thrust, but still nice and efficient @MailManNL It's an inductor Oh, I was sure the black ones were resistors. Sorry If you look at MailMan's own photo, it shows an inductor, in a different package Inductors also come in resistor-looking SMD packages tho, like in the product pic. They're usually grayish. while resistors are darker So I wasn't that wrong I read they can be used for filtering signals. or power. Breaking the edge of the inductor off changes its inductance.  As long as the coil of wire inside remains unbroken, it will not be broken completely, but it might end up out of spec.. How much that matters depends on what it's for.. Based on its size, it's probably a part of a power filter.. In a power filter, the exact value is not that important."
Assuming I could find a replacement: is this something one could solder at home?,"Depends massively on your skill.. Desoldering may be more challenging than soldering. because you have to avoid all of the surrounding components, and avoid ripping pads off"
okay. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) Any  good analog vrx and vrx you can suggest?,"But it's a crappy 25mw vtx. You will need an analog vrx if you end up getting this aio A good ultra light analog vtx is the tbs nano unify pro32 **v1.1** (v1 is crappy) and for the vrx, the tbs fusion, steadyview X, IRC rapidfire or eventually the speedybee one, but depending on what you currently have you don't have to upgrade"
I have the radio master pocket with the elrs reciever and the dji goggles integra and I'll buy the beta fpv pavo pico is everything going to connect well?. I'm new to drones so I don't know everything well. Can anyone help!!!!,if you get an O3 and ELRS reciever. yep
Thanks!!. This one right?? Eslr,"well that is the radio itself, the drone needs to have ELRS as well"
Oh I see. The drone has to have eslr and o3 right??,"yep,   ELRS = the controller  O3 = the video system. if you had a DJI radio you would not need ELRS, but ELRS is better as far as I know. and more radios to choose from"
How can I check the Firmware of my Drone in Betaflight?,"should be shown in the top left and bottom right when connected I have this on my controller tho those two are not related in any way. the first screenshot shows you the Betaflight firmware version and target, the 2nd screenshot shows you the ELRS firmware target and firmware version"
can you check if it has a Serial or SPI receiver?. I think it's SPI but I could be wrong since they updated it,"that means that the receiver doesn't really have any firmware. it's controlled by Betaflight, so its compatibility with transmitters depends on the Betaflight firmware which has the code for the receiver hardware. Betaflight 4.4.x SPI receivers are compatible with ELRS 3.x.x radios"
I have 4.5. so thats the mistake?. I changed it to 4.4.2 but it still doesnt work. The binding phrase is right,"4.5 would've worked too. and you did not have 4.5 I think the HQ v2s are moderately high pitched but not high pitched 4.3"" of pitch is high pitch"
My quad flies faster with the Gemfan hurricane 51477-3. isnt 4.5 high?,If all you want is power get some r35. Pitch isn't everything
did you at least save a backup before flashing?,"okay. I wanna build a extremly speedy drone. and its only purpose should be to fly fast and maybe a little mit of freestyle haha. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) what makes the HQ R35 fast even tho pitch is only 3.5. or is lower pitch faster Pitch isn't everything. The r35 are designed for 5"" racing and optimised to just pump as much air as possiblr. Tho they are power hungry. And if you do a stupid setup like 6s motors on 8s having some r35 on will smoke even the best pancake motor oh. good to know haha"
This might be a really dumb question. So one of the wires broke off. So some of the threads of the wire are still in the soldering. Was thinking I would just solder the wire back in. Is that a bad idea? Should I just buy a brand new one?  I don't want to damage the  FC,I don’t see how soldering a wire back on can cause your FC to die
Ik I'm just paranoid lol. Should I try to remove the broken threads stuck in the soldering pad or does it not matter?,"If it makes you feel better, go ahead and do it"
I was just wondering if I should. Last question. The threads are barely sticking out of the wire. Should I peel back the rubber to get more wire exposed?,"solder it on and if it dies buy a new one cuz all it can do is save money if you were already planning on buying a new one. yes Yes, don’t pull it back too much and leave a lot of exposed wire though"
Hey guys do yall recommend moving the tx antenna down so that i can put a patch on it? Does it genuinely increase range?,"Whatever you put on the tx will dictate the range, cause once you loose the tx you loose video, even if you lost all other RX"
I'm currently using this setup:. so I should 100% move the tx from the omni to the patch?,"Depends on if you fly behind you a lot. otherwise put the patches on the top 2 Depends. A patch will only give you good range infront of you I typically dont fly behind me much unless its up close Not so much on the sides and behind like i want to fly out farther, so yea id keep my head pointed towards the quad So it's just depending on the compromise you want to do the x2 will do fine on the sides Yeah but it won't be as good as an omni 90° to the side and further back"
should i do some adapters and move the omnis to the front RX antennas? and some like 45 degree adapter on top for the patches? or open the goggles and relocate the tx antenna to the front?,with how this receiver is as soon as you put the patches on the top putting omnis on the bottom will make them useless
wait why?. oh because it really only matters on the tx huh?,yeah Walksnail on the first iteration decided to not do dual diversity. so it only matters on the one tx
wait so on googles x putting them down it better than up?,so youre saying putting the patches on the top makes the omnis on the bottom useless
and if its the other way around it works fine?,"no putting the omnis on the top would make the patches pretty much pointless hello guys my drone wont spin up the motors all the way in acro mode and it wont pitch/yaw/roll AT ALL in acro mode but it does fine in angle and horizon you get either patches or omnis, not both"
You should make a help thread in #help-with-drones and show your related Betaflight settings.. are your patches SMA?. or RP-SMA?,"""Custom made RP-SMA connectors, direct fit for your goggles."". so RP sma you got an SMA male to RP SMA female connector. and 45 degree adapters have quite a bit of loss"
dang. itll be a challenge but yea i can probs do it. how bad is the loss for the adapters?,Not actually much *if you get a good one* like the thick blue one from truerc with the semi flexible coax. Like the shitty shin ones will make you loose a noticeable amount of range
u got a link for tht by any chance? i'd rly rather not open up the goggles v_v,This one for exemple https://www.truerc.ca/shop/accessories/5cm-sma-extension
is there an RP SMA to RP SMA version of it?,https://www.truerc.ca/shop/accessories/45-deg-rp-sma-adapter i think im SOL cuz those are sma to rp sma yes. not as good bc no sensors
Can someone please help me with this? https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1258437476322770984,"hi, first off this looks like TRYP simulator. But i think I can help you. There should be a rates option somewhere in the setting. That’s where you can adjust the sensitivity of the stick movements. for example, if you lower the roll rate, your drone will roll slower when you move the right stick horizontally Hmm not sure if i can do that i take a look u can also adjust that with a real drone because i want it as realistic as possible to the real drone then. Some how i also have the feeling that the controller is to big for the feeling there's a few reasons we don't recommend the betafpv controller What are the reasons which should i buy i bought this its cheap and with the other controllers i have to wait two weeks"
Austria i heard a lot of order on bangood it takes much time im still in the limit to send back the beta to amazon what anotger good on amazon. ?,"a real drone has customizable rates too, I can help you set up the default rates though if you’d like"
But except maybe the handling(form) what is bad about the beta fpc?. I sent you a video i dont know where to do it and what is considered default? I also dont know if its normal tonbe that sensitive i just started yesterday and i always fly in thing and on the floor its crazyly difficult,"it doesn't really support anything we use properly. Shouldn't take too long, but there's plenty EU stores to order from. (drone-fpv-racer, rotorama). <https://fpvmarket.eu/> oh yeah let me clarify. the rates are something that you change in the settings of the simulator The form of this seema better for changing the rates on the real drone, you need to edit them in beta flight or something like that But u still didnt tell me why betafpv is bad the form yes I did. scroll up. Get something from RadioMaster or Jumper with ELRS Yeah i dont intend to buy yet first i wanna be very good in simulator"
I dont know what unmean by that? Drones?,<https://www.rotorama.de/product/radiomaster-pocket-elrs> <https://www.rotorama.de/product/radiomaster-boxer-elrs>

Yes i sent u anviseo :slightly_smiling_face:,The DJI controller is useless for anything FPV. get one of these https://www.fpv24.com/en/radiomaster/radiomaster-pocket-elrs-remote-control-transparent-gray this might actually be in austria
Ok thanks i quess i take the cheaper one is it much worse??,It has smaller gimbals so it doesn't feel as great. it is the cheapest you can possibly get. so it will feel cheap Its .com dint know where it is but not available but what emilia sent me i can buy there but do i have to choose sth specific when ordering there
But what unmean with feel cheap? I mean its small i think i like that. Whats actually with that?,"Ah yeah it’s out of stock, get it from Rotorama the DJI controller is useless. it won't work with anything FPV. The plastic, switches and gimbals *feel* cheap.. It is better to get the Boxer, T15 or T20 if you can. but the Pocket is fine"
Feel cheap like what? Main thing is its comfortable and it works :slightly_smiling_face:. Ok thanks and how do ubknow if things work and are conpatibke?,"if you get the pocket, boxer, t20 or t15 with ELRS it'll all be compatible"
Yeah i quess ill take pocket its smaller its better for good feeling i quess but again how donyou know if parts are compatible?,"they also have rotorama.cz t20 is the same size as the pocket, but only available on banggood The boxer is available in austria https://www.fpv24.com/en/radiomaster/radiomaster-boxer-elrs-fernsteuerung. At least I think they’re in austria, they popped up in the fpv market search for austria"
I think pocket is fine if the same quality i dont care how the sticks feel or do they move differently like physic is same right? So it will be fine,Sure. You will need 2 18650 batteries
Maybe im stupid but it doesnt find anything here when i click search. Hmm?,https://www.rotorama.de/product/lg-inr18650-m29
Why donu think austria its fpv.com.that not an austrian site? Also i font see delivery time,they are not the same size really. at least from what I saw online and shit they are pretty much the same size and the pocket also has removable gimbals
every transmitter does no?,I mean this. ig stick ends is the correct word
what is it called when my beta fpv drones props automaticly shut off when im going down and it skims the ground in normal mode?,yeah that's pretty normal my boxer.... does not do that :(
airmode. the sticks can screw off to some extend though?. maybe not all the way. but you can definitely make it way smaller,"barely worth it. let me send a pic. one sec yeah same on the pocket. lol. I mean honestly. I don't think anyone is extreme enough for that to really be a problem well it does come with a blue protector. so its fine but from what I understand the pocket is really just a ""throw it in the bag"" anything can be. depends on how much you care about it like maybe I am wrong but this looks like its entirely removed I'd never do that to any radio lol I am planning to get a 3d printer soon, so il be able to print a protector for my future T20. since it lacks protection. damn well, I guess the T20 is the size of the Pocket with the ""downside"" of having full-size gimbals tho I have been told the gimbals of the t20 are not the best so if they are shitty I might replace them with the ones on my boxer or ag01 the hall gimbals are perfectly fine just like the stock radiomaster ones are. the RDC90 ones are a scam though one thing tho, I am not sure if my t20 comes with a bag or not. no clue, its a surprise you never know with Jumper I also got it off ali, but it looked legit ali is a storefront like all others honestly ali has been cracking down on scammers HEAVILY in the past few years was a old stores and the reviews looked good, and were a nice number of sales and always sides with the customer. so scamming for something niche is a lot harder Wow sone physics o dont dont unterstand dont make sense for menlike whej it comes tomflying but ibget better My girst medal :slightly_smiling_face: 6 seconds dude thats crazys hiw is this even posaibke see if the sdk ever got released for it Flying backward somehow doesnt really work. I know its german msybe you can put it in chat gpt and tell me is he right and is this hardware appropriate for your first cheap drone can you fly good with it thanks in advnce. Its about a cheap starting pack and the technical brands and terms are international anyway i quess you understand what its about :slightly_smiling_face: it allows the lichi devs to add support for it Hmm how can i fly backward its seen in videos it hast flys backward if i turn down throttle but then eventually it crashes in thebground"
https://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=elrs-r24-p6#tab-id-2. I have this receiver and A radiomaster pockrt,"don't buy any more matek elrs receivers in the future. they have quite a few problems But for some reason after setting the pwm output when the tx is lost to the lowest so that the motor turns off. Yeah I learned about their issues after I bought it. The throttle up to 50% does nothing. Only from 50% to 100% acts as the 0-100 throttle. The pocket itself is fine. The channels page shows output from the lowest to the middle. It wasn't like that before, used to work normally check if its on 3d mode. thats my guess as if its being used sometimes it puts it so 0-50 are reverse"
didnt really.. ask a question?,That was not my question :smirking_face: Its really easier talking to ab as to write back and forth but nobody want to reply personally
i assume youre german?,No not anymore now its too much now for me. Austrian ah but i assume you prefer writing in german Never compare me to german again :smiling_face_with_tear::face_with_symbols_on_mouth:. :grinning_face_with_sweat: ok well what was your question. FPV24 is kinda meh
Are u german why did u ask?,you can order from them and theyre safe but not really the best customer serveice. yeah i am Bro no i need to chill now talking yes but no writing anymore its to much. Nit just about the order right now.

But there wasnt a question huh He was just tryna help you?,"Yes i know its all good :smirking_face: why that :smirking_face:. im feeling kinda offended rn. but its okay. if you want to talk, come into a voice. then you can talk about things Why you offended a little later i need a break from that subject now i was since 7 hours now busing with it sorry. I need listen some.music and open a beer :grinning_face_with_sweat:"
no because of the the emoji. all good tho. verständlich. gutes Bier?,Gute schon aus :smirking_face: Is there going to be any big difference between the walksnail mini 1s lite and a full sized transmitter the 1s are less reliable and go up to 500mW
"Ye, but wouldn’t water get into the hole where the sound comes out of?",yes but like. can't do anything about it. maybe put a water-blocking-filter-thing on it
Hello. can someone tell me how to choose long range motors?,"When I pull on the blade, the axle and outer casing move up a bit like the things i should look out for that makes a motor long range Well, removed the motors and blades, then pressed down on the axle and on the c-clamp at the other side and the play is gone!"
My Radiomaster Zorro that I haven’t turned on in like a year since I kinda forgot about my drone won’t turn on. When I charge it the power button turns red but I’ve charged it for about an hour now and it’s not turning on. Could it be broken? Or do I need to do something special to turn it on. The red light starts flickering after a few seconds when I put it in the charger,Perhaps the batteries inside are cooked. Try to replace them They are some 18350 cells
"O yea, I will when I am home again. And otherwise are batteries like this commonly sold in normal stores?. Or should I have the original ones from radiomaster","no, definitely not common items. maybe in vape stores, but that's about it Then I’ll have to order a pair I guess"
Yeah. What's the difference??,"oh, both use an 18650 battery.. just that once includes it"
But why is the price different?. Ahh,because it includes the batteries
The normal one u have to buy it separately?,"yeah, but dont buy the one with it included. batteries cant be shipped via plane so delivery will take forever. I forgot my multimeter battery had died and I still need to buy a new one. Let’s go, for some reason it works now : D"
What kind of screws are needed for this camera mount and where can I find them?,"usually m5 i believe. mine uses an m5x25mm. flanged button head screw, find them pretty much anywhere i heard someone say drib is an owner/leader of something at unusual machines, rr, fatshark idk but someone said he is in a position of power and is 100% for this move towards militarizing stuff that's what I was talking about like what position is he in I'll link you it. <https://www.unusualmachines.com/about/executive-team> hey im still gonna hold out hope. that he isnt really for all this. and hes pushing against it dude he is literally doing this. this is almost all him. he wants this, he is literally in an executive position at the company that only exists to do this awful shit"
that only exists to do it? ehhh,yes. this is all they've done. and all their investors are also for this. don't be crazy Hey I'm still gonna hold out hope that actually poutine just wanted to hang out with Ukraine and will ask for peace what the fuck do you want me to do. give up drew is a grown man with a massive following. if he was actually against this he would use that. but instead he went and set up this company
so you think he started um. so you think he isnt just the COO but he started it?,"he was definitely a big part of it. this isn't a particularly large company, these people all knew each other or drew straight up applied"
"to be for real with you. i hope that if drew ever did care for the community. i hope, if rotor riot ever did care for us at all that they will turn this shit back around somehow. and do exactly this. use their following to push against it. is it too late? idk","the rotorriot you remember is practically gone and replaced i dont know enough about it to tell. i mean bardwell is still there loosely *I stabbed babies* Man I hope he will stop *I stab more babies* He probably didn't mean it *I still stab babies* He will turn his life around i wonder what hes gonna say about it. bardwell i mean is he going to like cut off the connection between him and rr or not. because i mean if you watch his livestreams its pretty clear he doesnt support this stuff I mean, there is a difference between being kinda against the idea of militarizing a company and doing a public move to separate yourself from them because of it"
Is the Walksnail Avatar GT KIT new? It has 2000 MW,"Guys is it ok If I fly my avata more than 200 meters and start loosing signal. (googles 2 ). Enviroment is good enough. just a big filed in the country side, was seraching for some settings but there isn't that much to set"
Did you do the fcc hack ?. Yes. Never seen a walksnail vtx with a fan on top. (from the factory),"I need that fan for my walksnail moonlight vtx Just a higher output power version of the current version. So you would get .5x the range on this one theocratically. If you used 1w on the older model It basically just randomly came out on the store page without any message on social media. it's quite sketchy, they just kind of took the 5v from the v2 vtx for the fan..."
You already got that?,It just looks like an over clocked version of the normal one not quite. it does have a like entirely new RF frontend apparently
Is the fan available for buying? Cant find it,the standard v2 wouldn't be able to do it because MIMO stuff
Would that be the fancy pants new vtx with 6x the range ?. Oh nevermind it was a vrx not vtx that they talked about,I think some people will be posting videos tomorrow. at least someone said that in the WS Discord There is a vid already it has the same dimensions as the Moonlight kit I hope they will sell the fan to me it is just kind of weird that they. didn't do the moonlight unit and make that 2W Fr. That would have been fire. Maybe theyll do that in the near future well. at least it has an sd card. because the on-board storage of the other ones is just awful. awful awful awful aint no way the other ones only have on-board storage moonlight has sd card. the normal v2 and 1s board only have on-board
Isnt it possible to get the new VTX and use the moonlight 4k cam?,"yeah with a little dvr board they sell. but like dang. that's a lot of boards. lol. I wish I had enough money to play around with all of these last stream i think he showed the ''welcome to the family'' video by redcat and he was pretty pissed about it. well more making fun of them but still. i dont really think hes fine with it Out of curiosity is it possible to put the walksnail avatar into fcc for the 1000mw if your in ce. Or is that purely unchangeable yeah just unlock it. all walksnail stuff comes as CE, even in the US. and you have to unlock it yourself A small part of me (very small) does wish I did that but more research when I first got into the hobby and potentially went with walksnail Not that we are shouting it every day that walksnail is better than dji Be nice if the next system had a decent rf output power.. And let us unlock / select what we want Man, what a timing you have to say that https://caddxfpv.com/products/walksnail-avatar-gt-kit. We were just talking about it. Walksnail now has more power"
Are you being dissapointed or admirative ?,"just scroll up a bit :p. teeny tiny bit Perfect timing for me to get into FPV wings Not disappointed.... but admiration.   I'll never need 2w power.  I don't live in a country where I'll ever be able to make the most of that. 5-8 km already doing that with the o3 will never go further. The standard WS VTX's do 1.2W. and the 1s VTX's do 500mW I love that, I can stick a cheap 1s VTX on an outdoor micro and get all the range I need I guess the only way to do that with a dji product is to do a naked o3. But that's just pricey as fuck."
can you recommend me a guide or a recommendation of yourself so i can make it look better than dji? I am using ND16 filter most of the times,"Yeah these things are like $120 walksnail 1s kit is 90 bucks No, no dji product works with 1s voltage without a vrm. And a naked vista would be a better choice Oh yeah that's a good point.. doh! I am hoping for a O4 Air Unit. I find the quality of the video transmittion much better than walksnail moonlight with googles x that mostly means you don't really see what good video is. moonlight tends to look worse to people because by default it is more light sensitive and way less sharp. doesn't mean it's worse in quality, and it's all stuff that can be changed and fixed the o4 from avata 2 is so much clearer than my walksnail. I dont have default settings genuinely everyone I have talked to thinks the o4 looks like crap (including me) and that even the o3 looks better I don't know much about editing, but you mainly just want to mess with how much light comes in and the sharpness. that'll get you at DJI level"
are you using less sharpness or higher?,"Emilia is saying that with a post production pipeline walksnail will produce better results, but straight off the dvr the dji looks better because of the built in processing"
but we are talking about the live video feed from the googles right?,"why would the live feed matter :thinkies:. the reason the live feed is like that is so that you can actually see in the dark I was talking about live feed. In that matter the o4 clearly wins for me but video recording I think walksnail is better. idk if its just me but I also wanna get a beautiful live feed:grinning_face_with_sweat:. For me, footage is a nice added bonus, but what I really want is the here and now, not later when the feeling of flying is already in the past. Personally I want a low latency goggle feed at the expense of live quality, if I want high quality its for the recording im making and in that case the recorded footage is way more important that shiny goggle feed. Flying high latency just for better video feed feels super poopy to me instead of video recording with walksnail, I prefer to use DJI Action 2. Yeah I definitely see your point and that's also a solid route to take"
Hows the 3d printed parts market for drones?,is it over saturated or not enough
probably over saturated? there's print shops everywhere,"Usually people just print it themselves. Huge overlap between drone owners and 3d printer owners Yo guys ,  what is this https://imgur.com/gallery/FJVCtkw Hehe, sorry I'm learning"
"did it like, fall off?","I ordered a replacement board you can just solder on a new antenna. a wire even, that'll be better It came with one for the sma connector. Or whatever it is you can just cut a wire to the right length and solder it to the active pad"
was the fc not shipped in a plastic box?,"yeah that should be attached... it's an easy fix if you'd rather not replace the board try to get a refund from where you bought it, that's not a great tw aio anyway Cool I'll send some pics.... eBay... I think I can solder it.... solder a 30mm piece of wire to the active one of the 4 pads youd be better off soldering a length of enamle wire to the signal pad than trying to resolder that antenna. people call it a ceramic antenna, but its a polymer that will melt I'm not sure off the top of my head which pad is the active one, but I know that 3 are just there to help hold the antenna (and maybe grounding) and one carries the actual signal yeah if you look closely at the pcb you should see that only one pad has a trace going to it Yea that's what I was trying to figure out. I've got some enameled wire .. can you take a more infocus pic of the 4 pads. as close as you can get and keep it in focus Yea, I think it's the bottom left.. One moment. Little blury looks like the bottom left in the product image I found, but it's not a great pic Yea I'll try and get something close up. I used to have a nice microscope .. Thanks man.... Everyone, that k you oscar liang says that Antenna Length (m) = c / frequency / 4 That is true ... I'll get setup for the fine work.... Bummer though i think its like 31.2mm for 2.4ghz That seems long.... Hey I gotta run out for a minute I'll bbl let you know how it goes. hey my drone fell today and it seems like its not reading the commands well is there a fix. i mean when i turn right the diagonal proplers turn on and for left the same. but when i accelrate (joystick upwards) it doesnt work at all"
Can you fly in a circle ? Like moving around an object circlewise no right for that you would have to be ablenflying sidewards??? Also can youbfly backwards?? Also when i turn upside down and then back down upside it doesnt fly like a plane it somehow gets slower or moves back ( yes i put my analog sticks oposite directions. What is qx7? How fo you actually know whats compatible and good on which specifications do you have to look??. Also is this good the crux the skyzone what he writes at the end. Soni cansically start with like 300 analog with good drone. 160 euro drone. Whats actually difference acro.mode and the other just trying acro atm in tryp sim yeah alot of questions,"You will need a hardware mod to do anything full speed on it. on top of that the QX7 feels awful and is like 4-6 years outdated at least. Just don't get it, it isn't worth it.. If you want something similar consider a RadioMaster Boxer or a Jumper T15. probably cheaper too, and can come with ELRS or 4in1. asking for a friend lol. We use a drone with a qx7 controller at work and he wants to get the same thing. I'm trying to push him to get a radiomaster yeah definitely make sure he doesn't make the same mistake countless of others have. the QX7 is no good in comparison to anything modern yeah you can fly in a circle and backwards. Its definitely different from a plane because it doesnt have wings and stuff. its a different aircraft But how can you it seems its not possible maybe not possible in acro mode qx7 is a model of radio. When you buy a radio you basically just want to check what protocol it uses. Radiomaster is good and comes in 4-in-1 and ELRS versions."
"wym, you just move the sticks and make it happen. Takes a lot of practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJqYvirSulg. yeah 4-in-1 includes a bunch of different old protocols https://www.multi-module.org/using-the-module/protocol-details. but no one really uses any of those these days if they're building new. ELRS is the most popular protocol by far right now",What are protocols. Yeah i heard u need to take elrs protocols are the languages that electronics talk to each other in. You gotta make sure different components are speaking the same language so they work together
Abyways not so impartant but i quess flyibg circle and backward not possible i tried for hours. Can i dm u?,"i assure you it is possible to fly in a cicle and backwards lol. respectfully, no Ok how is it possible"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xgB99JLJo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSSVasxkxnU,Im gonba watch it tommorow thanks i need to stop for now my hesd broken but ots too much to write i rly would need tp speak to sb preferably non i a voice chat where several people re just with one if sb is ok with it here hey dont out me like tht i gotta cover my bases yaknow thanku tho ofcourse :thankyou: Dient wtchball but hes not explaining how tondonit its obviousoy not possible. Maybe tryp fpv is not realistiv he pushes his theottle stick down and it fly backward with me it just crashes of course in the ground also. He doesnt explain one bit how it works I assure you it is possible to fly backwards and fly in a circle. You can even fly a circle backwards. man there is stick cams in both videos haha
This stick cams are not usefull at all  how u actually record your controller when u have goggle on ? But anyways its not usefull at all he just yaws it shouldnt work like that bad video enough for today,or good ol' EdgeTX logging
Ok. But he used gonpro around his stomach just to record the controller? Haha but yeah its no help for me that video unfortuanately also if they do that they should show in slow motion,"honestly man, it just takes practice. Take it nice and slow, nice and easy. Practice consistently. You'll figure it out. It's not easy I can just say flying backwards wont work in tryp. And also not flying in circles for that the dron would have tonfly sidewarde as well i assure you, you can fly backwards in trip No has nothing to do with practice i tried every move that just doesnt do that. Nevermind I am telling you the truth, brother I need to wtcj videos by text its not explainable for sure. Well maybe works yes but videos not helping"
is this possible to replace?. ufl antenna ripped the pad off. is there something supposed to be here? or do I just need to add solder,Damn i have to mess around with tht shit as well i give up. What even is this picture
the second one?. its the ufl pad. where the male connector is soldered onto,I dint know what youre writing sorry. Fuck it i try gonto a club if that doesnt work screw it you ripped off the pad. the one pad that actually provides the signal...
ahh ffs. not possible to fix at all?,"your one chance is following the trace, see if it goes somewhere trace is like the ""wire"" but pcb term. the wire that goes to it. which on your board seems conveniently very hidden"
can you send an image of a normal board with that?,I mean just look at yours. that could possibly be a via it's going into (so onto a layer inside or to the other side of the board). so you might want to wait for someone who knows a bit more about vtx's or whatever this is to identify wherever it could be if you can't find where it goes
flashed elrs?. latest BF?,yea i was thinking of flashing... ill see what i can do thank you. ugh. well that went about like i thought... didnt flash. now im stuck ... im trying to figure it out. ive never flashed drone firmware before.. ill figure it out... its stuck at rebooting to bootloader.. You need some drivers. unless you want to mess with stm bullshit. use the impulserc driver fixer
Guessing it's an SPI receiver?,im not  sure but i think im ready to fly! The newer more modern AIOs have a proper ELRS receiver in it. which makes them independent from Betaflight
hehe. hmmm is there a way to set it to start in ... acro mode?. seems like it always wants to start in angle?,"hmm nice , yea im flying ... now i just need to learn to fly it... hehe , thank you for your help. that was a little more than i bargained for. Soldering the motors kinda sucked. just tweaking the hud and calibrating the accelrometer properly. yea i was planning on starting with a 5 inch build but i wen this route and fried the original board and now got it in there. so the 5 inch should be a bit easier. had to solder the camera too ... old one had plugs for everything.. im a ham radio guy so soldering is nothing new but this stuff is tiny. and my eyes suck now. I have to use a microscope i have these like magnifying glasses, i bought them to stick the lense into my goggles and turns out they work great for soldering too.. shoot i have a hair problem in my house apparently.. everyone does once there's 4 spinning tiny motors involved acro is default. so it's dependent on your switches. on the modes tab you can change them"
i didnt put a braided wire sleeve on when i first built my quad. will it damage the esc if i reinstall the motor again?,"no. well, assuiming you dont damage it with the soldering iron"
any danes know some good places to buy parts?,Depends on where you're from
denmark? Or like where in denmark,Just the country. Try looking at the stores listed here https://fpvmarket.eu
"I was flying my mini 2 se 400 feet in the air and a few hundred away from me, but I could still hear it. Is something wrong with my drone?",So hypothetically How high of a kv can i go on 6s before it won’t work because of heat or other issues. Talking 5 inch on a racing frame I have a question about fusing accelometer and gyro data and using Kalman filter.
What about kalman filter? It's slow af.,"accelerometer can tell position but not orientation, and especially not rotation rate, because you're not attached to the ground. you need rotation rate. in fact you can fly fine without an accelerometer, acro mode just needs a gyro. you only need an accelerometer for angle mode and higher complexity modes I dunno. this seems like a question for the betaflight discord"
Isnt gyro very error prone?. Betaflight is for diy drones?,Thnx. Ill check it out. https://discord.gg/gbVPTfn4
Please lets.write.pm easier? Well i want race mode vecause you learn fastest also game said that because you need to be very precice if i manage race mode i manage everything else,"a quadcopter is an inherently unstable aircraft. the only reason it flies is because we forced it to 30° is the camera uptilt, there is no wind simulation in tryp, as you can see in this beautiful artists representation of a quad the camera is tilted upward X degrees off horizontal so when you keep the view straight with the horizon the whole quad is tilted forward. Also, don't fly in race mode, just fly in the open map. And you can change the ""sensitivity"" (the ° per second of rotation, also called rates, which dictates how fast the quad will rotate when you move your stick and the response curve, if maybe you want it to be exponential, so more control at the low end and snappier at the edges or a flatter response). And yeah our quads don't fly themselves and don't fly like a wing either Hm i fly.straight.an it blows me to the side maybe because i start from.mountain ita weird Cause it's not perfectly flat when it starts to fly. So it will go a bit to the side. It doesn't stabilize itself, you have to learn to do it yourself no one wants to DM with you :loudly_crying_face: That's rude. And let's keep the discussion here, racing isn't the best way to learn cause it's harder than just freestyle. You gotta learn with the easy stuff. Then get to the more technical aspects of the hobby like racing"
Can you send tutorial where to change sensitivity i dont even know if mine is high maybe it should be like that?,"Go to the menu, then search for ""rates"" or something that looks like a curve. I'm not home so I can't show you I dodnt understand most of that i just keep practicing. Yes im the weirdo here :smiling_face_with_tear: Rates are a measure of how fast the quad will turn, and it's in degrees per seconds, so if you do a full stick deflection at 360°/s (very low rates) it will take a second to do a full spin I know its much harder but i wanna stick to it if i can do that i can do mostly anything else Well that's a stupid way of doing it In freemode its very slow tonlern Cause you will just not improve. And get stuck cause you wanted to start with the harder part. Just start with freemode until you can actually fly well Still where can i do that in tryp no idea where and what tonset it maybe its ok like that i wanna set it the most realistic to a real drone And being good at racing won't make you good at freestyle No thanks i will keep trying :face_with_tears_of_joy: You can also tweak it with a real quad. That's just counter productive if you want to learn faster why are you asking for help when you don't want any I dont know what tweak meana It means changing, adjusting etc Ok i dont wanna start argument but im sure it does 100 percent i disagree here completely because you have to be exact know racing down a mountain if you manage that u manage everything u know. Chill i want help i just have a different opinion with the modes. Im stuck tomthat know If you want we can go down this road, I have been in the hobby for a while I can say with confidence that freestyle and racing aren't the same thing and you can become the new mck but still suck at freestyle. Now if you don't want help don't ask for it Its best to do what u wanna do at the moment i just folow my instinct Well good luck if you don't want help I'm just going to go sleep Broni will donfreestyle anyway later but firstly i wanna manage some race maps i fixed on that now. This going back when u miss one extremely learns your skill racing and freestyle are completely different styles and skills"
If you know what i mean but im still way too stupid yet but getting better but hey again you said sthbabout sensitivity i want the sensitivity i have in real life? So how do i change it and whats normal?,the default is probably normal Sure its different bro i do t wanna argue about that now all good i still try that now I know it's not the best metaphor but it's like going to the gym and expecting you will become a master at judo thanks to it. It just doesn't work like that Im surenit will get your skill up the most even inteoduction told it but hey all good dobt wanna fight :smiling_face_with_hearts:. Noooo not the same at al Well it's the exact same with racing and freestyle. You are going to fight an uphill battle and at the end just fall down the cliff That not a comparison because i dont expect to be good immediately i know it takes ton of time. And gym has nothing to do with judo lol :slightly_smiling_face: Ok good night its 2am I don't have the energy for that if you don't want to be receptive Hey nevermind i dont wanna make myself unpopular bow. I just wanna do that right now please accept :slightly_smiling_face:. Ok see ya. I just wanted to k ow with the sensitivity things. I know these are 2 different modes of course. Atill im stuck to that right now. I just keep trying the only thing actually which would be important to me to have the sensetivity match a real drone or is this automatic when i buy one once i want it works the same and that is all :slightly_smiling_face:
"I put too much solder into my esc capacitor, and its ball shape now. Its sturdy but how do i fix? Or just leave it as it is","Solder wick (buy one with flux in it), desolder pump or just aggressive flicking with your iron. Just came back to it, theres red stuff on it, am i cooked I dont think i saw that until right now I have no clue what that is. unless it's bleeding"
"where's your OSD???. Without OSD all I can assume is that your soldering is bad, but you really need OSD to tell.",When I’m flying it shows but in playback it doesn’t show for some reason
did the voltage on the OSD drop?. can you show the ESC?,"Maybe, i did spent a quite long time on fixing that ball before i came to here. But i just noticed it so i am unsure if it was because i heated it too much"
What iron and solder are you using?. it looks like it didn't really flow much at all,"hopefully you have a flat tip to go along with it. bit more challenging without one crank the heat and use loads of flux, the way it looks right now is okay as it'll all be re-molten when you solder on the two main leads anyways Im on 390 c. By how much I recreated it again just now and the voltage didn’t drop at all picture of the ESC. main leads mostly. because it rebooting is 9/10 times a bad connection to the battery"
It had a pretty good connection. But could it be corrosion from a water crash here?,That right pin looks iffy. Idk tho solder on the main battery leads. it looks fine
you swapped all 4 motors?,you can't just. do that. your motors need to have the proper kV for the battery voltage...
clearly not?. how much throttle were you using to hover around?,With 6s like % 30. %50 for 4s I think you should consider replacing that xt60 on your quad. It's cracked and the pins look meh
So should I still fly it today with the same xt60 and 4s?,you could it'l be just fine Two Karen’s just made me leave the park. They took my picture and are reporting me for no reason. Lmao how dare you fly your drone
<https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/pre-1stflight/#bench-test>. can you do the bench test?,"uhh might not be able to atm only cause the beeper i have set to so its always on. will that go off if im just plugging in usbc no battery and might wake the kids up. you should be able to unplug the beeper right. if configured properly it shouldn't go off with just usb-c is tlm ratio what i want to lower for this step on the radio in the script for elrs. [Set your ExpressLRS module to the lowest power level using the Lua script. The packet rate doesn't matter much here.]. oh nvm i see the power settings packet rate refers to the Hz value what should my tx power be. it has a number and mW at the end of it > Set your ExpressLRS module to the lowest power level ah i see, was getting confused with other packet rate setting. will send back the data for the record, it's probably perfectly fine. that's what the code means, it's probably just that you had the arm switch on when plugging in the drone"
all the cheapo stacks have more than 40a don't they?,yeah but im considering 20x20. cuz weight yep call me a goober for it goober. you finally get to have the luxury. of 30x30 and nice and big pads. and you throw it away lmaoooo. i mean ive always been a weight goober get one of them skystars or hobbywing xrotors
Because the people there can answer your questions?,I assumed that people there would be knowledgeable about multirotor control theory in general and willing to help. Guess I was wrong.. Perhaps asking in the specific channel for help with betaflight tuning was the issue. Perhaps you should have asked in the general chat
each?. I don't know honestly,motors can spike above what the 100% chart says. especially when doing things like turtle mode yep. but the burst rating of the stack is 100a. so it shoullldddd be fine right theoretically yes. I'd get a really good ESC though. Foxeer or XRotor is what the racers like to use and I'd go with that
how light do you want it for you to need 20x20?,hopefully around 650-680g with a gopro hero 11 mini. and a hv 1100mah gnb pff you can easily do that with a 30x30 stack and also the frame i want the stack kinda sticks out. and im slightly concerned. sourceone v5 btw. if i can then 30x30 it is some conformal coating helps with that for sure. you're never going to directly hit it with anything. worst that happens to it is a bunch of grass and stuff gets thrown onto it yeah i mean it should be fine. aight so skystars 30x30 50a it is
noo :loudly_crying_face:. none of that is soldered at all. What are you using?,"i was plugging the battery to ESC just fine until the second plug. it refuses to power and sparks coming out of the positive pads seconds after plugging off the battery. i don't have access to multimeter well... it's probably dead. can you show pictures I just realized the pads are not soldered enough. Leaving solder 'floating' above the pads I remember being frustated that the pads wont combine with the solder. I'll send a video It looks pretty well connected to the pad Maybe the whole pad is ripped off. But that'd be really hard I dont know, not sure how to choose the right solder"
The fact I can't find that with easy search results says enough. What iron are you using?,"Also the ESC is fine now, i got little relieved. Eh, a 1.5 dollar solder Here's some recommendations: It says here has 40w power 63/37 solder from Stannol, MG Chemicals, Kester or TBS (and yes, it is expensive but it lasts you years). If you can return the iron somehow, get a Pinecil or TS-100 or equivalent (should be 30-40 US dollars in most places)"
You think there are big risk from using cheapskate tools?,"yes, I mean you already saw what happened. your other joints don't look that great either. when you buy good tools, they last forever. but just buying better solder would help you loads (and flux) Alright i guess i can consider that Hi everyone, i have a ""throttle""  flag when I try to arm my quad even when my controller stick is all the way down (also there doen't seem to be any offset in the reciever tab): Turn off RSSI_ADC first of all if you're using ELRS done ! forgot to turn that off from the old flysky reciever) :slightly_smiling_face:"
does everything move when you move the sticks while you're in that tab?,can you show a screenshot of when your throttle is down. because those look like default values. :thinkies: and up:. i will increase my stick tresshold to 1050. see if that helps no 1000 is good. what version of BF is this it did the trick :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: its  a old wacky omnibus thing from 2018. its a wonder it even flies
"Did you configure the osd correctly ?. I order dozens of times with them, it's probably not their fault","What does that mean we did everything with betaflight In betaflight, in the configuration tab you have to enable the osd, then an osd tab will appear, go there and select battery voltage"
"Does anyone here have experience with fusing gyro and accelometer data? Or using Kalman filter in particular?. That place is for people who use ""betaflight"" whatever that means, why should i go there?",Ill do that when I'm back and thanks Cause you should use betaflight on your quad I tried 3 different cards. Non of them worked
"The only other options is kiss for nostaligics, Ardupilot for planes and *other stuff*, inav which is ardu lite, and the last one that I forgot which is tinywhoop focused. Litteraly everyone. Betaflight is the only good firmware for quads that aren't lr focused  (To the exception of wings and models that aren't multicopters). Did you try just contacting them ?. They won't ship before tomorrow 3pm30 anyway",So there isn't any rush to order today
Could it be that I’m not from France?,"It isn't the issue, they are popular in the whole (mostly the west side) eu"
What should I get the mob6 elrs old version or the meteor65??. Bc I found another site with the mob6 and idk which to get,Meteor65 *pro*. **Not** the mob6 24024 No the old mob6. not the 2024. and the normal meteor65 The elrs mobula6 is fine and can easily be made lighter and pretty nice The normal one isn't great. You really want the pro
So should I get the mob6?,"Only the 75 pro is in stock It works the other way around with the 75. 75>75 pro. If you do, also get a meteor65 air frame. And if you have a printer you will want to print a lighter canopy. Cause the stock one is kinda heavy Dont have anything to solder or to print Well buy a soldering iron. Not a question, you will need one havent really gotten to that part of fpv Your card or idk doesnt work then Get one when you buy your whoop, really But you could go with a meteor75 and a moblite frame+2024 canopy/air canopy"
So I should get the mob6 and a betfpv frame?,"Chat with support of them tomorrow They have live chat support I want to get a 65 now And buy a soldering iron with it i had a mob7. solid quad. will do. thanks for the help Yeah, tho the motors are a bit too heavy for 0802 and the aio is also kinda heavy for 75mm 0802 idk for me it was ok. So i will buy the mob6 and see if they have a soldering iorn It's a good quad, but could be better Yea but for what it offers its somewhat solid"
does anyone know if the Googles 3 are already compatible with the O3 Air Unit?,"flashed firmware and now the drone cant be recognized by betaflight and its not turning on with battery, just beeping this is the O3 compatibility list They just want profit over profit wow deja vu. I remember talking to you about this a while ago sorry I cant help. I am also a fpv noob. I dont know shi and I have like 1300 messages on this discord asking for help and troubleshoot haha. yeah we definitly did. At first I was like ahh I will wait for O4 because I already have Avata 2 but nah I got myself Walksnail afterwards do you maybe know how to enter dfu I believe there is a button on the FC and you have to press it and then plug in the USB cable while still pressing the button https://oscarliang.com/dfu-mode/. this should be plenty no. i cant enter betaflight well that is a problem that must be solved first .. can you maybe help pls"
do you get any error from betaflight or just nothing?,"i dont rlly remember, was flashing and right after nothing worked anymore ok try now. and let me know connecting to betaflight trying rn. nothing working"
so just nothing? no error?,drones not blinking when conntected to usbc. yea  nothing. cant be recognized by betaflight
"well if you are not powering on, that is the actual problem. did you build this drone or is it a prebuilt?","just bought it yesterday idk about drones just started, it worked today had no problems just after firmware flash its not working anymore ehm I am not very good at troubleshooting. there is a betaflight dev. in here, he might be able to help you Vitroid. but its prob something with your drone @Vitroid can you help pls"
"raduzir textos com a câmera Hi guys, I'm trying to build my own flight controller, could anyone help me with how the orbit modes work so I can implement it in my project?","i flash the firmware of my drone. and after that, it just stopped working. its not recognized by betaflight anymore trough usbc, the LEDS are not lighting, and also if i put a battery it just beeps and no lights it will be when it officially get released. if i move my drone here nothing happens. any help pls did you fly your drone before flashing and crashed or something like that no, i just had problems after firmware flasing. now i got the drone back connected to betaflight, but these problems now"
so you never flew with your drone and crashed?,"i flew some hrs ago but no crash, got home, flashed firmware and now this i had a similar issue but it was a day after the crash. I also flashed and nothing worked. problem was because the FC was a bit wet. I cleaned it with isopropyl and it worked after that again lol. btw your gyro and accel doesnt get detected somehow maybe try go back to betaflight 4.4 and then check if it works again @kusho just flash 4.4. same way as flashing to 4.5"
you mean flash the firmware again. but one older?,yes. check if it works with 4.4. 4.4.3 i clicked on auto detect. okay always do that. btw is your drone diy or prebuild
is that a balance connector?,https://oscarliang.com/fix-balance-plug-lipo-replace/
you have build the drone yourself right?,no just bought it yesterday can i get a link to that drone. i wanna check fc idk how i can provide you that no like to the website. haha bought it used. from a guy uh. do you know the name

oh. i had no idea you coculd do that. why so?. is it so fast its impractical?,I wouldn't save so much on the motors. I dont know the brand but I mean 11€ per motors is very cheap isnt it hmmm yeah. it is suspiciously cheap. but if its real its a really fast motor
"wdym? like prevent it from flying?. well, as you just said, use an esc?","No no. How do you intend to tell the esc what to do. Why do you want a standalone motor You just need to manage your throttle and practice *outside of the race mode cause that's not how you learn, that's how you get stuck at dumb stuff that wouldn't block you if you just went into freemode* oooh, i have this 555 timer im thinking of using to drive it. https://www.buddyrc.com/products/ztw-mantis-slim-30a-sbec-g2-series-esc-for-airplanes  https://www.buddyrc.com/products/easy-servo-tester Bro its not vecause of menits not like that in other maps i guarantee I need sb who already played that map tonexplain Just go in freemode on another map and practice there. I played it. And the physics isn't different from the other maps Hmm. I swear it doesnt do that in otger maps but i keep trying theres a pwer pulling you down the mointain"
why should someone explain tho? just practice and practice till it works,I just keep trying butnif it is like with a real drone its fine i just was afraid im learning some wrong muscle memory Perhaps screenshare would help explain what you’re taking about ill try that map rn. ill let you know if its weird or not. there is nothing wrong with the map @Hollyfut Perhaps learn in the freemode instead of the race mode like everyone has been telling you so far. So you can actually practice. And not get blocked on dumb stuff Inwill donthat fornsurenasmwell. As well
Yeah first you should be in a mode where you can jet yourself up far into the air and have room to move around. Screenshare?,Maybe later i keep on trying now but im pretty sure there is sth pulling down when die unlast play maybe made an update dude. if you screenshare we might be able to tell you what that thing pulling you down is i can asure you that there isnt anything pulling you down besides gravity. if you refuse to accept help you won't recieve help Ok. Nah bro i dont refuse i just really wanna keep on trying now :slightly_smiling_face: all good :thumbs_up:
motors just not spinning. any idea?,theres no battery pliugged in send a screenshot of the setup tab
"Hey guys, I replaced the aio f4 board in my mobula whoop. Do I need to tune it?. It seems really hard to fly..","try turning esc_sensor on in the motors tab. wait no. uh i cant. when i do, it dont get saved ok uh. you clicked save and reboot right ok well what esc are you using whats that exactly. does this help"
what trick should/can I learn to make flying even more fun and make the footage also more entertaining?. thats pretty much all I can do constantly + trippy spin,ive done 2 irl theyre freaky
a matty flip through a obstacle?,"both. like some bridge oh i did a powerline. irl isnt that dangerous haha nope, ive touched it many times i can do that. done learning it haha I have another one in mind but I can't remember the name"
And the one that's kinda like that if you see what I mean ?. Idk the name,"huh:loudly_crying_face: Yeah I can't remember the name can you show me in sim pls damn. can you please explain whats going on there (all is low to the ground) You go forward, punch up, do a flip and a roll and you finish looking back and you fly backward wait lemme learn that real quick. shouldnt take longer than 10 mins"
you mean this? @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks),"Nope. You do a half roll. And you continue to fly backward for a bit. Then I like to do two rolls to get back to flying forward Yeah that's the name. Thanks. Kinda I've mostly seen people pitch forward into juicy flicks, but I suppose that works too Vitroid found the name btw"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjTnIrm0oSE that dude almost does the same as me,"Yeah that's what my beautiful drawing was supposed to show okay lemme try that with forward half matty flips are also fun... basically the reverse of a juicy flick. half roll to upside down, pitch back to fly out backwards forward looks much nicer tbh Then you add 3d in the mix and reverse to a powerloop"
you can see it at the start here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuYOgGpwU3c,"i can do reverse powerloop You can't stop midair upside down without 3d (while you're at it just watch the whole vid, I am very happy with it lol). banger song too"
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) what is this called then?,"you can see a single mattyflip in my video above okay. wait was that a half matty in the beginning Try dat, half Matty then 3d into a kinda Matty in the other way (arrow shows the orientation of the quad) wooaah guys look what page I found https://prowhooper.com/all-tricks/. nice imma learn all of em looks like an angry monster about to eat some kinda of red glowy thing. speakin a strange language motors not rotating, were working before. pls help Don't question my amazing artist's impression"
have you check the wires?,"all fine. also it was working before. just after flashing firmware i had problems, now everyrthings working again except the motors. just not spinning. but when putting in battery, regular peeps come and all mottors do their little flicks"
Did you try re flashing ?,what does that mean. how i do that i bought it from some guy yesterday. those are the infos
picture?. of the drone?,"also, dont leave you usb plugged in. the flight controller will overheat"
Do you want help to select parts ?,"Still thinking about 2 options if i rather shoud get toothpick that as not that good with wind but i alredy have batteries(less pricy) or rather get 3.5"" because better against wind and also i dont need registation (but its pricier because i need to buy 4s batteries i think) Well, a tp3 3s is a ton of fun, a 3.5"" 4s is a ton of fun, there isn't one better option than the other. It just depends on what you want cause they will fly very differently"
"What is tp3 3s. 3.5"" 3s you meant?","A toothpick is like point and shoot and will fall like a leaf, (does get kinds blown away by the wind but light wind isn't a big issue) not a lot of throw but it's amazing to learn on thanks to all the control you have. Nope Tp3 = toothpick 3 = 3"" toothpick No i mean toothpick 1s or 3.5"" 4s https://fpvcycle.com/collections/toothpick-3/products/kabab-toothpick-3-tp3-frame great toothpick frame It looks profesional :D Oh, well yeah 3"" 1s toothpick and 3.5"" 4s schoolbus is extremely different. Like comparing a tinywhoop and a miniquad. Yeah, made by kabab who basically invented the toothpick form factor, and the frame is nice and light whilst being durable for 3"" 3s. It's too heavy for a 3"" 1s tho Ik but ye its all about the price and if its worth it + idk at what price Range are either of those A 3"" 3s is like ~150€~ to build, batteries are like 13€ each I mean 3"" 1s because i dont have to buy batteries A 3.5"" 4s is like ~250€~ and batteries are about 15-20 bucks each. A 1s will be about 120€ Without batteries right"
It's very much a crude approximation and the price will vary quite a bit. Yeah. What batteries do you plan on using with it ?,"Ok yeah that should work fine (you should have gotten folded cells but it's a bit too late for that). We usually use ~600mah on a 3"" 1s Idk the difference in those but these were the most budget option. 40 euro for 10 of those. + Bt2.0 soldered by myself Well folded cells have basically no sag at all, rolled cells have quite a bit of sag. And that one is a rolled cell And what is a sag :thinking_face: For exemple, When you do 100% throttle on your quad the voltage will drop then go back up. Well that's sag. And folded cells are basically rock steady with the voltage Oh that explains my chaotic voltage :D Still i would say worth it for 40 euro I got used to it and ik when its enough A folded cells is like 5 bucks. You didn't actually save much"
550mah are 5 bucks each?. Or 350,https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/batterie-lihv-lava-1s-550mah-75c-4pcs-betafpv-12310.html 450mah is 5€. 550mah is a touch more
I mean i got used got used to it so ye its chaotic but ye. LiHV are folded lipos?,"Well, once they end up dying, which they will, 1s batteries don't last super long, remember to get some folded cells. Folded 1s batteries are LiHV, but all LiHV batteries aren't folded cells I have no idea when they are near dead i just make em suffer :3 Well, once you don't get much fun out of them, then it's time to retire them Its getting solid 4.5 mins still so ye. Okay back to 3.5inch vs 3 inch toothpick. What you think its better to invest at as my second drone I'm talking like 6 months down the line I have now tinywhoop so idk much about bigger drones I'd say 3"" 3s (since the cells you got might have a lot of sag on a more power hungry setup) cause the control you get is amazing to learn to fly a more powerful quad than a 75mm Why háve you picked 3"" 3s over 3.5"" 4s Cause if you ask it to go somewhere it just does it. You don't have to fight it, it's basically point and shoot. Really enjoyable to fly Whereas a 3.5"" 4s will fly more like a 5"" quad, not exactly but kinda like it, doesn't mean it won't fly great. It is"
"But it will fly better than 3"" 3s. ?","No. There is no better. Just different They are made for different things. Doesn't mean it will fly better. And a 3"" 3s in a lot of cases will accelerate faster. Since it weights almost nothing"
But 3.5 inch is more powerfull i mean?,"It can crash also faster :thumbs_up: Yeah but it weights nothing so there isn't a lot of force to break the arms Worth it to build costum 3 inch or buy bnf. I will break em Anyway i mean :D There isn't any 3"" 3s toothpick bnf afaik. Eh, a toothpick is really durable. And a good 3"" frame will also be durable Oh ye true closest is crux 35 Do you think 3"" 3s can be made more powrfull then crux 35 or bnf 3.5"" Yeah but The power isn't the only thing you should look at when building a quad"
"Btw one think why we cant do 3"" 4s?",You can. Just not useful on a toothpick
I am not sure even what to look at. Wont see much difference in flight?,"You would need to do a schoolbus quad to utilize 4s on 3"" well, which is also a very fun quad. It will just be quite a bit heavier for not much more power So ye not worth it. And ye what shoud i be looking at when building quads If you go for the 3"" 3s you can just follow their recommendations https://fpvcycle.com/collections/toothpick-3/products/kabab-toothpick-3-tp3-frame You can also use their motors, they are pretty good They are based in the usa. Idk if you can find this frame in the eu tho. But you have lots of 3"" toothpick frames, just get one around 10g that looks durable USA shipping prices are too high. Wait that gave me an idea vitroid i think has 3"" builds. Nwm its 3"" cine My controller doesnt work in freemode :face_with_rolling_eyes::thinking_face: A 3"" schoolbus too. Just get something like the tunerc frame. You can probably get it from dfr"
"These are school busses?. I feel like 3.5"" look way cooler at this point. :D","Yeah. Well, build what looks cood to you"
"3.5"" is Best with 4s?","4s or 6s, but it will perform about the same with both. I wouldn't bother with 6s and just use 4s"
"Is there big difference in 3"" 4s and 3.5"" 4s?. In performance and in price","Yeah, they don't fly the same at all. 3"" is a micro, like 2"" and stuff, 3.5"" is a miniquad, like 5"" for exemple"
"So 3.5"" is more powrfull?","Yeah it will have more thrust 3"" can have more *snap and pop* tho since it's smaller and lighter. Not much more expensive what exactly doesnt work"
"So 3.5"" is better worth?","Again, doesn't work like that. There ain't a better option, only different options I mean in your opinion what is better :D I like 3"" more than 3.5"", but I feel like more people prefer 3.5"" So I shoud rather get 3.5"" You tell me. There is no better I am bad at deciding :skull: How much mAh are you guys using for 3.5"" if its a 6S flip a coin. i use 4s Just do both:DogeKek: A 3.5"" will have more power and fly kinda like a 5"", a 3"" will have more of a micro feel if you see what I mean. 550-650mah for 6s Nice idea i have spare 500 bucks laying around"
Why 4s over 6s? Is there a reason behind this?,Damn. Why only that little amount
because it's a little drone?,Cause smaller quads draw less current
But I could also do like 1350 right?,"I feel like 3.5"" because 3"" frames looks like drone with tiny hands It will be like strapping a brick to the quad Yes it just falls down can send u video yes if you're building like a crazy cinewhoop I mean, there are some sexy 3"" frames like the siren f3 split"
then use more throttle???,Racing works just fine
Could I use 2207 1960KV motors for a 3.5 inch?,That looks good but i dont think i will find that locally
no? those motors are bigger than the drone itself,"Yeah, you need throttle to keep the quad up it looks like you starrt mid air"
Lol no it doesnt respont nothing tonto with throttle cant u se?,"Your 3.5"" quad is really small then :face_with_tears_of_joy: i can see your not throttling up Ahm no i start at starting point ah yea cuz that makes sense. ahm yes Ok you cant see its not responding nevermind"
How much would you pay for 3.5 frame average?,"40-ish. i payed like 35 for mine What size and kv motors are recommended for a speedy and punchy freestyle 3.5"" 1804 2750kv if 6s. About 3800kv if 4s 1804 2450kV, 1506 3000kV are some examples Could go a little higher if you want to, could go a little lower too It's just not durable For me it sounds like a 3.5"" can be way faster than a 5"" drone Well your assumptions are wrong. Unless you compare it to a 3s 5"" Yeah that one is nice I think i ll reprint those tpu parts I believe they are open source too. If they are not just contact flyfish and they will send you the files"
What is this part at the Right Side of the image?. For gps?,I dismissed my idea about building a drone for speedy purposes only. I think imma build some type of racing drone but with walksnail vtx The blue thingy is for a buzzer Just asking but thanks :) I think it's there to protect the battery wires in case you route them under the VTX and carbon plates yes. so far not broken Oh yeah that could work too But I mostly see people mount buzzers inside of those
Ig i ll put this frame. Next motors?,"it's a really good frame. I have the VX3 Like 3500kv on 4s. Could go higher if you want to tho oh it's the 3"" version 1804 is way too big for 3"" ehhhh I'd still go with like 1604, but 1804 would rip Hell ye that looks sick. Uhm what are these sizes... Yeah but I feel like 1604 wouldn't be as snappy on something like a 3x3x3. Even if I would pick a 1605 over an 1804 Indeed, I'm dumb. Well 1804 is still great on 3.5"" You should look at the aerolite 1605 1404.5 4500kv and 3x2.5x3 props If they have it in stock you should seriously consider it. Well they don't have it in stock. The rcinpower 1804 are good too I heard the flyfishrc 1804 are decent as well Problem solved you have to press space didnt have to do that in racemode And I heard racers like the xnova for 3"" and 5"", so I would assume their 1804 are nice too. Yeah those Idk what shoud i pick. Left or right. There is different kw Depends on the voltage you will use Right for 6s, left for 4s Ngl they look so cool Could also go with these, I heard they are really durable https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/moteurs-xnova-t1804-3500kv-boite-de-4-7136.html But i wanna look at other options also. Hmmm. Shoud i go for Red build or blue/purple Well that's up to you"
I am not sure what you think performs better?,"Rcinpower should perform a little better, xnova should be more durable (Doesn't mean rcinpower isn't durable and that xnova won't perform well). (but they should be better than the other in those area) Idk :skull: i am bad bad at deciding. I like both colors Personally I would go with the xnova just because I find black with red accents beautiful. All black motors with red accents look awesome Maybe that is good idea because i can find Red in grass better Well, both will get you in the air and you will have fun with both red and black just looks sick in general 70 euro for 4 of those i think very good price :0 Like look at these for exemple, beautiful literally a skystars motor Those doesnt look as good. Those are nice"
Okey what is the next thing?. FC maybe?. I have no idea what to look on FC so..... Help me please :D. Wait. Btw those motors will fit in the frame?,If you have the money definitely the xrotor 20x20. Yeah. Basically all 1804 uses 12x12 One thing. 3500 kW nowa is for 3s i run 3600kv on 4s on a 3'' so 3500 is plenty
can someone recommend me better gimbal sticks for the radiomaster boxer? i dont like the stock ones,"https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/combo-xrotor-micro-45a-g2-4en1-escfc-bl32f7-10859.html And https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/stack-mamba-mk4-f405-mini-reactor-44-esc-diatone-11942.html Would be my recommendations, with a preference on the first one Yeah that doesn't mean much uh i made my own so idk. i can send you some i have way too many. made like 20 spares but ive never broken one"
"I can test my 2207 1960kv motors on 1s, doesn't mean it won't work on 6s. How would you break a stick end ?","are they hard or like soft Hard ones i tested like 10 of em all hard. Or you can print aymeric do you also have em I use some tbs crown jewels, way nicer imo. I love those stick ends. They are so nice Absolutely. And those fit me perfectly those stocj ones hurt my fingers. so pointy Uhm wdym doesnt mean much its official"
Yeah they aren't very good. And ?,"whats the name of em. M4 or M3 Technically I could throw really stupid high voltage into a motor and it will be fine without any load,  (If we forget that high voltage is magic). M4 Mismatched blue and black, beautiful i used to have black ones but i prefer these"
Are you 100% sure they will be okay?,No they will implode and create a singularity that will absorb the earth
What shoud i even look at these?. How are they different. I dont know about FC anything...,"The xrotor is bullet proof, the diatone is slightly less bulletproof but still really durable"
Hmm i mean like performance?,Yeah the fc/esc doesn't dictate the performance that much. If it's good enough it's good enough. The specific stack will just dictate how fast the esc will burn and how long the 5v regulator will stay with you before falling off
:skull:. One question lets say i bough the first one FC and Red Black motors and i plug there 6s will it explode?. Why all FC have a need to give micro usb not usb c :thinking_face:,"It sure won't be very happy Cause the convertible fc was made before USB c was a thing Well, it's pulling 23A max on 3s, let's round to 25, at 6s it will draw, *a lot more than what the esc can do* What is this connector for And the motor will probably melt as well. To plug in a DJI air unit Or wait my bad i read it wrong. I read it like you plugging the goggles :skull: It's to connect an o3 or vista, a relic from the dark side Btw may i put rgb leds on the wings or legs or how you call it On the arms. And yeah you can. Just a bit of a pain in the bum to wire"
One thing just for my info what are for the little holes / dots on the pads?,"It's just some holes sprinkled on all fcs, a wise man once said they lead to a treasure whats that on top of the switches. and what are your stickends called uh i called them dingus stick ends but i designed em myself. if you want some i can send em to you. i have soft fingers so it hurts to flick the metal switches for me.. Okey sooo its hella expensive and shoud be compatible with the frame To a stack of empty wallets called ""average fpv enjoyer's bank account"". It is uh you can always cut them shorter but i printed them myself too But at least it won't blow up where do you live. i wanna buy them from you Kinda the point of the xrotor stacks germany. we talked earlier i dont really want any money just shipping is fine i dont have any use for the spares (won't save you if you really badly crash). (like if you pull 80A on an esc it won't magically survive)"
I ll slowly land at grass at 0.1 km a hour. Full throttle?,"(and don't say it's impossible cause I managed to pull 110A out of esc 4 on my 5"")"
you only have blue right?,"If you crash and block a motor yeah my resin printer is broken sadly Oh okey i always disarm and crash for stupidity even. Where you live It can basically transform the motor into a straight wire, and our motors are pretty low resistance, so if we listen to daddy ohms, we find that Vx{not a lot of ohms}={a lot of amps}. That's a good habits that unfortunately not everyone has I have an FDM printer i am at Bratislava Slovakia if you want but pretty limited on filiment Cause not disarming before crashing is like the number one cause of smoked motors I just sometimes randomly disarm mid flight :skull: i mean.. fdm is kinda terrible for stickends Pff, small player, *I* dropped my radio while doing lr with my 5"" quad 2.5km away layers and theyre alot less accurate I have 0.25 nozzle i mean. Okey wont go cheap on that drone so getting the first one I mean, diatone isn't some cheap crap either. Yeah but you will still have some layer lines and an fdm just cannot be as accurate as resin there spikey. cant do that with fdm"
I got mine stickends for 11 euros. Pretty bad but worth it. What next?,"(technically, yes I can, I can drill a custom 0.0.5mm nozel and use 0.001mm layer lines). (won't be very fast but I can). Well, the vtx. And antenna/rx"
should i get myself this resin printer? https://eu.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-mars-4-msla-resin-3d-printer-with-9k-mono-lcd?_pos=1&_psq=mars+4&_ss=e&_v=1.0,if you know how to deal with them. incredibly toxic fumes. very messy Don't forget that the printer is the cheap and easy part of resin printing
i dont know anything but i can learn it like flying fpv right?,"You also have the alcohol bath, uv curing, not diying from smokes, the expensive resin, the resin that wants to murder you etc. Fdm is the easy mode its really unhealthy. trust me i have one and its not fun Fpv cannot kill you in your sleep with toxic fumes ah shit. i changed my mind. aint getting one in the near future lol. i mean i have a garden where i can print Will you use it often / do you know the risks /"
"Probably for the better. Besides, fdm is good enough for basically anything. You still use analog right ?","Better thing is to order it. Yup Well, for the camera grab a ratel 2, and for the vtx, a rushtank mini or solo I am not planning on going into digital Jlc3d i think is pretty good but limited. There are 3 to choose from Ratel micro. The pro has a narrow fov, the baby is kinda meh Nothing in stock. :smiling_face_with_tear:. Got it Could go with a runcam phoenix 2 Depends on what is better They are about the same. Iirc the phoenix has a brighter image, which is nice"
But will still be good on 4:3 resolution in goggles?,"The Skyzone o4x pros will work well on both 16:9 or 4:3 anyway I can change the brightness Yeah but you can't change the dark analog fog a lot of cameras have Pheonix is 10 euro cheaper. Hmm what is that i never heard about that Both will be good, but the ratel 2 has less of the analog colorful noise. A lot of analog cameras just have a dark image. That is like kinda foggy imo Oh you mean like those little colorfull lines or what are those. Ratal is Red so good with the color of build"
Able to explain what is vtx?. Btw rush tank mini or solo any of my local sellers doesnt sell,It's the bit that sends video to your goggles
Oh okey. Any other vtx?,"both of those are a bit overkill for a 3.5"". I'm happy with my happymodel OVX303's, but there are others as well. I know people really like the TBS Unify Nano's I have literally no idea what even vtx was before so... what are your thoughts on this 3d printer:  https://eu.elegoo.com/collections/neptune-series-fdm-printers/products/elegoo-neptune-4-pro-fdm-3d-printer#specification Uhm idk i woudnt buy it You get an issue now what :person_shrugging:. Harder to solve it. But idk never used those. I use prusa because those are very good support and also can help you do you know any services that let me send them my print files and they print it for me. e.g i need flexible cam mount"
But i mean will the video signal be better?,I'm not even sure if the Solo would fit In FDM or resin. I have no idea what i am even doing :) 50/50 :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: And the ovx is kind of weak
can resin prints also do flexible prints for cam mounts? they need to be stretchable so i can fit my cam in,"Ye they can but more pricy i bet Otherwise you can get a tbs unify, one of the big ones I mean the rush tank look cool but ye i care about performance Rushtank is basically the best there is. Basically indestructible, and it has a pretty high output power"
@Vitroid what do you think? I shoud get :D,"Tho analog vtxs are getting harder to get since the people who make analog chips are having a shortage so most things will be out of stock I still probably wouldn't put an 800mW VTX in a 3"", but you sure could https://jlc3dp.com/3d-printing-quote"
Why not ? 800mw isn't even that much,"isnt the company based in usa or something like that *I know, it was a typo* China. Sorry my bad :) shipping is about the be expensive not needed, and you can get cheaper VTXs"
800mw are like how fast it will send video?,"No. It's the output power. It dictates the range/penetration of the video feed Try to look for local ones then I mean, sure, but 800mw vtxs aren't particularly expensive Up to an extent yeah. You can have issues with high powered vtxs where it overwhelms the vrx and you get breakup for exemple. But that happens at like 2w+ Tbs Unity has has how much At like 1.6w wat it isn't a big issue. Unify, and the unify have 800mw. Tho don't get the cube one, cause it a vtx and crossfire/tracer rx"
So rushtank and Unity equally good?. Or. https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/tbs-unify-pro-58-ghz-hv-sma-1184.html?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-ai0BhDPARIsAB6hmP7YY84ryuoz27yifM0d15y4TBqFCpcrR45FAr0dm3i3_n7jh3egdiwaAm4vEALw_wcB. This?,Yeah. I prefer rushtank. But tbs unify is very good too
Is there any difference expect for fancy leds?,"what filament is normally used for camera mounts and what filament is used for bumpers, etc Try asking #3d-printing best TPU depends on your printer. I want rushtank because of those leds :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Ngl rushtank mini is cheaper While there are better TPUs, I've found this stuff prints in most printers easily.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TI3JUTM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image"
Is there some items you dont reccomend getting from aliexpress?,Shoud i get 48 ch of 37ch
Do you think shoud i rather get Red props or Black props?,Doesn't matter so long as they are some hq 3.5x2.5x3. Or some hq3.5x2x3. Or 3.5x2.2x3 What is the middle number for But I would say get some grey ones. It would look nicer. XXYYZZ  XX=size in inch YY=pitch in inch ZZ=number of blades Hmmm what pitch is Best The pitch tells you if you were to spin the propeller a full rotation in a solid how high the propeller would go. Basically more pitch = more thrust. (usually). 3.5x2.5x3 is most likely ideal
What is the disadvantage of having a very high pitch?,"Well, higher pitch will require more torque and will pull more amps and will be harder to control for the motor. But it will usually make more thrust. Everything else being equal"
3.16 for 4 props. Good price?. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) last thing is antenna right. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out!  €3.16 | 2pairs HQ 3.5x2.5x3 Tri-blade Prop HQPROP 3525 3.5inch FPV Propeller https://a.aliexpress.com/_EI1x5Nt. Btw these props,I think imma buy the Bambu Lab A1 mini. easy plug-n-play
Are you gonna use it?. Just note 2 things if something breaks you can order only from bambu and if you have issues bambu wont help you. @Vitroid i found FC stack on AliExpress for 40 bucks less shoud i trust it?. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out!  €45.01  20%OFF | HobbyWing XRotor F7 Flight Controller FPV G2 45A/65A 4in1 ESC Combo BLHeli-32 DShot1200 for FPV Racing Drone https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQ1IIRh. Originál price on dfr is 130 Aliexpress is 90,"and am i right to say 3.6/3.5 per cell given i have 4s or even a hv pack, is when you should land land when hovering at 3.5"
Wanna ask able to help?,"yeah looks fine to me. but that's ONLY the ESC that you linked. the stack is 82 dollars Ye ye ik so i ll save 40 euro. :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Able to reccomend some antenna for drone 3.5"" it's the same as a 5"". flyfishrc osprey, rush cherry, foxeer lollipop are the cheap ones. truerc matchstick is the fancy one is this the IR and is it bad for a 720mah 4s liHv battery. i feel like i am only able to get like 2-3mins while in past 4-5"
Are they better and worth it for the price?,"in my opinion no. but it is one that would never break. hence it's so expensive depends on if I'm building a bashing quad or not. if It's a basher, I'm getting the matchstick. if not, I'm getting a handful of cheapo ospreys a chonky drone that is meant to never break but still be abused is a good description"
Osprey. I think i shoud get a little more :D. Long or short?,short. it ain't an LR drone Bruh its only in gray or blue i wanted Red but :person_shrugging: get some plastic spray paint. and solve it. :p. or even electrical tape Nah gray is good. Its little bit short only
Hm what is that. Like fla to sma?. And then onto the sma the antenna?,"yup, it's called a pig tail because it looks like one I am not sure if case is good with it. Frame *"
I have two questions if my FPV drone uses 1s batteries and i use a 2s what would happen? 2: will any FPV headset work with my drone?,"al. alr. Im glad i didn't do that. Thanks Doges U also have to know if u have digital or analog For goggles, 5.8 analog works with 5.8 analog goggles. Walksnail works with Walksnail. etc I have a DJI goggle V2 and it can view DJI digital. Say o3. And I have a module to do analog"
so the EV800D will work with the Happymodel Mobula7?,Yup. I own it :D. Just put battery. Turn on goggles and hit search
both? if so what is the quality like?,You could also go DJI goggle V2 but u will need a module Ig good but ev800d is pretty  bad If u plan to first go analog then o3
what is a better pair of goggles that are not super expensive but better?,Idk I went DJI goggle V2 cuz I went refurbished and because I planned to get o3 im not that rich but i wish That's why I finance stuff Ig you wanna find a gold middle get an cobra x does that mean good and not super expensive Like Amazon often has for me a 6month or 12month plan if I use their card It is Best boxed goggles it has reciver that good goggles use and good quality im kinda on a budget...... I didnt get it because i went it all in to get Best analog goggles. I mean ev800d is pretty good option for starters. But 2 main things nose gap and weight at the front
is there a better one for abt the same price?,I dont know anything else. Only more expensive. Ev800d is good if you are in budget i use a quest 2 with a diff headstrap so i might be familiar I'm still waiting for that newbeedrone I saw for 69.99 to say I can buy it. So I have a replacement for my dead mobula 7 HD I mean if you arent worried about it being big. Then go for it I got it and they are good but i wanted to upgrade. Yeah
alr. so as in me not being embarresed? or just heavy?,"DJI is definitely not something you want to buy into new right now Yeah unless you plan to want an upgrade path I wasnt embarassed it looks little bit strange but i mean WHO else has goggles like those no, then walksnail or hdzero is better digital wise especially for tinywhoops Feel special :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"
so like look like a crackhead is what you mean right?,"Cobra X is 250 usd and significantly better than the EV800D, as they come with a good receiver and screen. The quest 2 isn't really similar since VR headsets render two eyes instead of just a screen. Cobra x Best for price, ev800d Best for budget, starter the ev800d aren't necesarilly heavy... they're just heavy in the completely wrong spot and they feel terrible because of it They put lipo battery at the front :smiling_face_with_tear:"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) these?. Uhmmm. I can check,"I just want to see what it'll look like also so so sorry for all the questions im asking I think it could be cheaper to buy one of those kits for like 350-375 mine is gonna be 384.95 Uhh i got only from my new goggles. But ik i recorded videos ev800d are a 100, meteor75 is 120~, charger is 30, 5 batteries is 20, pocket is 70-80 were you not talking about a 75mm whoop oh. the meteor is better right now"
https://youtu.be/s2-n0wobows?si=NbQsRcOEVBEWgxbV,for the record: the entirety of the drone camps channel is a scam and is only solely there to sell you stuff with referrals. they have lied loads of times and are pretty hated Ok then I will show you another review
What lenght shoud i get?,"anyone reviewing that kit is basically lying.... no betaflight, bad goggles, shitty controller. probably the shortest Unless Happymodel has updated the mobula7 very recently, the meteor75 is the better one with the newer AIO. proper serial ELRS and such"
https://youtu.be/tPuMv0FZLjY?si=Hqhqwp__YQtTy7ix,"all-in-one, tinywhoops have the flight controller, esc, receiver and all that goodness in one board. hence all-in-one I mean I heard betafpv is a good brand betafpv is a good brand for their hobbyist stuff. all the stuff geared towards newcomers is a scam What is ipex1 and ipex4 @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  The Metor says 6min of flight time i mean it's a tinywhoop don't expect much flight time of it when pushing it I get 5 minutes at max the batteries are cheap and you can charge them continously. get 40~ dollars worth of battery and you never have to stop flying I got 10 550 mah for 40 euro. They are holding good"
it comes with battery's?,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) different connectors. you want to see which one you have probably ipex4. but check
i have 1s  4pck 3.8v with PH.2.0 plug  is that good?,"we have a thing in #frequently-asked-questions about it. but you want folded cells. and bt2.0 or a30 connector. so tattu, betafpv ""lava"", dogcom. they come in 5 packs There is also china hobby I hear and I got gnb they seem to be alright I got normal ones :D. Because i didnt know what were folded ones when i started..."
didn't I link you proper ones back then doge?,:grinning_face_with_big_eyes:. Lets say i went little bit cheaper option I mean ik when to land so ye
What are the fixed wings are Camera Drones Roles?,Most of mine are gnb. I think they work fine. folded cells will literally give you like. 30 seconds more flight while lasting longer. hence doge gets 5 minutes instead of the advertised 6 minutes Idk much i get solid 1 hour outside
Should i get the GNB battery pack or the Blomiky pack???,neither. where are you from Sologood Tattu 5 pack 300 bucks for 3.5inch costum RDQ is in Florida. pretty close WHY IS IT SHOWINGME TATOOS
300mah? for the battery's,probably 450. for the standard meteor75 Cheaper to buy battery or anything that is FPV. on a dedicated FPV site. Amazon rips you off
Is there any way to charge a DJI phantom battery other than using the standard charger?,Getfpv pyrodrone racedayquads
this a good charger?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CG8SVK6H/ref=ewc_pr_img_4?smid=A1F0PST2407CR0&psc=1,+ some antenna @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what you think yes but don't get that off of amazon. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623076796923928/1247237951113531434. use this list I got from aliexpress and works good Like Emilia and I posted a moment ago. Only buy from that list. Amazon rips you off
what was the drone called again?,My favorite is pyrodrone The non-pro Meteor75 or the Mobula7 Meteor 75 is better for indoors only the non-pro meteor75 but it's hard to find in stock right now Mobula 7 good also in light Outdoor
what's bad about the pro VS non pro?,the pro is more for outdoors. it's way too big. and just kind of heavy
so if i wan't to do outdoors i need a diff drone?,"somewhat yes. but when it's not super windy you can totally rip a 75mm outside I mean just get 10"" it can fly indoors"
For a beginner i should start with Sims then fly indoors?,a beginner can start with a tinywhoop. since they don't really break combination of both is good
alr. should i get the pro so i can do indoor and outdoor?. like in my backyard and bird watching,Maybe use searchfpv site the non-pro can do outdoor when it's not windy. the pro can't do indoor
what if i have a spacious house?,I have a weak PC so i played 2 hours of sim...
How many inches. is the pro. ?,"82mm. which is too big for indoor, and not as good as an 85mm for outdoors so you get the worst of both worlds... So i should just get the non pro"
alr i will. that means less money anyway. like 1 dollar. I WILL BUY A HUBBA BUBBA WITH 1DOLLAR!. what is the diff betweek FRSKY and ELRS?. Pls. Help,"let's. not try to ping 9 thousand people. lol About frsky we dont talk here TL;DR FrSky is shit, ELRS is brand new and awesome ummmmmmm. oh. alr thanks 349.95 saved 134 buckaroos/dubloons"
I have made sure i got all the things i need. samsung battery?,two 18650's for the radiomaster pocket i tried to find all the cheapest places for you alr Thx. I think this will  be super fun I also have a lot of un finished houses in my neighbor hood so i cn fly throught those and mine dang I wish I had that lol. ain't no one building stuff where I am
are the bettery's rechargebale?,or will i need to buy new ones once they dies score. Im glad bc buying new batterys would be a pain it is but if you have like. a vape store locally. they'll have 18650's too bru. :grinning_squinting_face: the finest of establishments
what if i buy a six pack with a charging deck???. 200IQ moment. ?,"the problem is. wherever you're seeing those you want it to be from a reputable brand. LG, VapCell, Molicell, Samsung, whatever. I linked you the highest capacity ones that would work Tokeyla i dont think so..... because they'll say crazy things like 5000mAh!!! (which doesn't even exist for 18650). and they're often like the shittiest ever it says that :skull::skull_and_crossbones::neutral_face::grinning_squinting_face:. im laughing rn bc you just said that. 3000mAh is that real. it does say Authentic Samsung 18650 tho yeah but what i linked you should be the cheapest it gets evenn with shipping added"
do you know abt Generic brand?. what is CC2500,it's a very old chip. that can do things like frsky and spektrum. but not elrs Are they AA battery's no. 18mm wide 65mm long. Li-Ion batteries. they're quite big the samsung 18650 right. so like single A batttery's alr. does it come with a station no the pocket can charge it. two of them of course ohh. Radiomaster too right. im so sorry i didn't know you were helping someone else
the RadioMaster controller charges them if i plug it in right?,yes. RadioMaster makes the Pocket ohh. Im so sorry  for pinging you a million times and annoying you if you were annoying me I wouldn't be answering :p oh. still sorry for pinging Ok i promise you guys in tryp in some maps therenis some kind of wind or sth 100 percent sure its draqing down the mountain believe it or not. I maybe write an email to ask what it is but its here for sure on purpose maybe that realistic what it is i dont know never flew a mountain in real life. Does this help u think or is it just like that Yes i do :slightly_smiling_face: but i wpuld rly love to see sb flying that specific map havin that game if possibe
Would It Be Better To Get A Kit Instead Of Getting Seprate Parts?. Like The Cetus Pro Or Cetus Act??,absolutely not. those are pretty much garbage compared to the thing we put together alr just asking bc i am watching vid to prepare watch some nick burns actually imma get the DJI T whatever its like the worlds biggest drone i think. it can pick up grown men
is my drone gonna be more than .55 LBS?,probably not. I don't know pounds though alr. sorry ill shutup now
"Yeah well, when will you use a 30x30 stack in a super compact build ?. You would use 25x25 or 20x20. Not 30x30","can someone pls check the wiring between the vtx and the fc, and tell me if somethings wrong. custom osd is not showing, rest is working fine The no component no problem fc. Well you would have to check that the RX of the vista is going to the TX of the fc, and the Tx of the vista is going to the Rx of the fc Looks like it's designed for like separate components soldered on, like a GPS soldered directly on top without wires can you tell me where pls, im pretty new to this Then in your ports tab you will have to make sure the uart is correct  (Say you used tx1 and rx1, then the vtx is on uart 1). Well, you have to use ye eyes and the manual and check Always use pinouts. Well most of the time i mean idk which wire i should check Yeah, but I just find this trend of no component on top a little silly, like, what's the point of having nothing on one side when no one is going to actually solder stuff on top. All of them Kinda a cool concept for super compact but still modular but too many differences in pin locations"
And in the ports tab the vtx is on the proper uart with the proper protocol ?,"I mean, if they are crazy they would use 16x16. 30x30 is for sane people. Send a picture of your ports tab Hey wait no I was planning on using a 16x16 https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1259560111643427017/1259773169330552874 everything is correct. like everything betaflight wise is correct. just OSD doesn't pop up RX is wired to R2 on the board Yeah it's using r2 and t2, try with those if i followed the wire correct Cause the osd is communicated with the tx, which is on t2 so uart 2"
so activate UART 2 or anything else?,"Put uart 4 back to normal, and put the vtx on uart 2 and see what it does do serial rx on uart4 and vtx msp + displayport on uart2"
both of them or just the sec?,"None of them. Do what Emilia said. And fix that wire please RX to T2 tx to r2. Tx goes to rx, they should be flipped between boards yes and set the peripherals of uart4 to nothing press save. and send another screenshot. okay now set uart2 to msp + displayport under peripherals. and do serial rx for uart4. and save. and show"
then no. did you flip the two switches on the left yourself for uart2?,"That's not what you want. RX has to go to TX2. TX has to go to RX2. They have to be inverted. Or else it won't work no only rx, msp went alone when i put preipherals. ah don't touch the rx on uart2 now after save. it stays. oh Mate, if RX is going to RX2 you won't get anything anyway, fix that before RX means receiver, having a receiver talk to a receiver doesn't work. You need to have RX wired with TX or it won't communicate. And TX with RX. And TX is for transmitter"
"osd waiting. oh man. There is RX, and the white cable is wired to this here right?. so rx to r2. so i should wire rx to t2?. the one under r2?","you can set the uart to be inverted You can just invert the white and yellow cables just tell them how to set it inverted in BF I have no idea you could do that. I prefer to just solder stuff. It's easier to solder 2 wires than do some betaflight magic betaflight magic is easier for me pls You should also fix your soldering anyway cause the joints are really bad. So switch the wires and at the same time fix the soldering i tried but this is the best i could do That's not an excuse, cut the exposed part to length, take the vista out, use flux and redo the joints also is wired trough this here. how can i rewire You will prefer to redo the joints than have it break off and die. On the vista And seriously please cut this one to length You cannot have that much exposed wire that is also touching the vista its actualyl wired to TX. not RX Fix your soldering anyway will do, but what about the osd. wired correctly. why not working"
"Did you change the uart to uart 2 ?. Remove the ""serial Rx"". Serial Rx is for the receiver. Like for the radio",Only have it where you have the ELRS RX connected they are using the dji controller. so sbus is on uart 4
"Can I see your osd tab ?. Hm. If you go into the presets and type ""DJI"" or ""vista"" is there a preset like ""DJI vtx"" or something that pops up ?. Cause I know with hdzero it gets all fucked up if you try to configure it manually",Do a backup of your current betaflight. Just in case. And yes
Did you do a backup ?,had one from before yes
"Ok, is the osd here ?",Can you send a picture of what you see in the goggles and of the vista when the battery is connected
"Also, just to be sure, you had an antenna plugged in all along right ?",Do that https://oscarliang.com/fpv-wtf-dji-goggles-osd/
Oh. Hm.... Did you update both the vista's and v2's firmware ?. Apparently when you use the little hack thingy you use you should use the firmware that ends in 606,"Idk, but some people say this one works better, so might as well use this one"
Isn't there just a firmware for the goggles ?,"no its dji assistent 2, at the end here it pops up that the firmware does not match or something. i already updated to the latest one, still pop up Well, that could be part of the issue that the firmwares are mismatched. Update on the vista as well https://oscarliang.com/dji-fpv-system-update-firmware/. If that *still* doesn't work, then plug everything on another uart like uart5 or whatever"
to which. u said the one with 606 at the end?,"Yeah, ideally. Doesn't have to be this one. But it's better if it is. And if it doesn't work with the 606 then you can always try again with the 1.01 okay. done. osd waiting.. Try the two versions. If it still doesn't work, re wire the Rx and tx of the vista to another uart (Rx/Tx), redo that with the new uart, remove the displayport/msp from uart 2 and see if it works"
https://flywoo.net/products/goku-f405-hd-1-2s-elrs-aio-v2 Will this fc work with walksnail vtx?,"yes but what do you want it for @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Gonna use it in a 3inch fpv drone Well, then you can pull out the soldering iron. If it's anything else than a 1-2s toothpick it will implode You want a bare minimum of like 20A 4s for a schoolbus 3"" quad. And you will be able to fix your soldering at the same time too @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)Yes, it is for a 2s drone Or a schoolbus. Ok then it should work Look for an x12 tho. Even if they are getting harder to find Or a betafpv f4 12A 1s (it's rated for 2s) or a f4 20A 2-3s if you want some headroom i tried. i am in india Happymodel x12, tho try to find one without a vtx. Cause if the vtx dies it can affect the whole board"
What's a schoolbus quad?,"It's the classical miniquad you think about, like the apex/volador frames etc"
"@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)https://www.quadkart.in/f722-35a-aio-brushless-flight-controller-v2-with-blheli-32-esc-icm42688/ will this work with a 3"" 2S schoolbus?","2s will be pretty crappy on a schoolbus. It's just a straight wire Then I'm even more confused, testing with multi meter and I get continuity but no voltage when plugging in battery"
"What if it's meant for sub250 long range drone?. 20 min flight time with normal cruising, nothing too fast and high performance using 14xx motors","There is some step down bec in the plug, 2s pack showed nothing but 3s outputs nicely Will be crappy. Possible that there is one"
How do i know what antenna is better? Lets say Matchsticks vs true RC core,those are the same antennas. just the matchstick is reinforced
Flyfishrc valodor vx3.5. The bigger the better gain?,"no. well depending on what you mean the more omni these antennas are, the less gain they have"
So if its 1.5 its better?,depends on what you want. generally you don't fly right above you right. so not having it fully omni to have signal right above you is okay
:thinking_face:. Does that mean its better?,"well they haven't actually posted the data. they just claim it's better. so who knows. given that all the other companies are stuck on 1.9dBi, I don't believe FlyFishRC but someone else might pop in with some more knowledge about that"
Isnt better stubby because its almost indestructable?,matchstick also is. it's reinforced
Matchstick will have better area to recive signal?,Can anyone recommend an AIO FC for a sub250 LR 2S 3inch quad using walksnail vtx
"BTW in regards to your antenna questions. What are you doing with the 3.5"" Volador. Is it freestyle or cruising at range?. i assume freestyle?","You can look at help with drones i posted my full list if its a freestyle drone ideally you want a stubby bro. Why. I mean the Matchstick shoudnt break that easily Well if you are going through gaps, holes, under tree's you dont want a anntenna sticking out. it will catch something. you want it to be all nice and tight. I use stubbys on all my drones and range is not an issue the matchstick is meant to not break. it's carbon reinforced and all that. it's basically the ultimate antenna Ooo you own the frame. Now idk what to pick stubby or Matchstick :face_with_diagonal_mouth:"
"I have no idea.... That is a 7""?","ye. I think thats the smallest size they do.. Not to bad for freestyle I guess. How much Range are you getting with stubby On those 2 drones, I can get about 1km."
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) why you prefer Matchstick over stubby?. I fly like 200 meters at max...,"Depending on the frame and print a stubby might be obstructed, if it isn't then get that. antennas are cheap! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: just get both and see which one you like. then sell the one you dont like You own 5 Inch or 3 or 3.5 inch wirh one of those little longer then stubby .. Yes ik but any other drone..."
"With other then stubby?. I mean like you dont have stubby on all your 5""?","i have stubby on all my 5"". accept for this drone, but this I use for going longer range.. The trueRC are good antenna bro! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: if you are new and you mgiht crash alot. They can take a beating"
Hmmm how much are you getting km with this one?,4.2 is the furthest ive gone. limited by battery.
Ye so ig i ll get smallest Matchsticks of stubby. Way too long?. I dare evething is out of stock,Bro 200mm is way to long. That's for long range set ups So stubby is out of stock and also Matchstick bruh
https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/matchstick-58ghz-carbon-edition-sma-antenna-rhcp-1pc-by-truerc-7939.html?_gl=1*1lstew7*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwnK60BhA9EiwAmpHZw-xCkQih7Pmj22XndyOCZRWNSl2vrFFiRe48s0yp9_gVV8GMvBtAVBoCyDAQAvD_BwE. What size are those. Slovakia,Just go on aliexpress and buy it from there if everything out of stock Aliexpress doesnt have true RC stubby. Only rush cherry or lolipop. Or some weird ones. Nwm they have them they look sketchy tho...
"Does it not take off, like even at 100% throttle, or does it flip over after crash ? Maybe give so more information","the motors are spinning differently, not able to fly. any idea pls. yesterday i changed settings of yhem with emilia no not taking of, it flips down one side Welp, https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146"
"@Vitroid Any recomendation for 4s battery on 3.5""? Please","~650-850mAh. CNHL, GNB, Dogcom, Tattu"
are the propelors int he wrong direction?,Yeah that's very wrong oh. pls tell me how to place them right Ig i dont have much options with batteries the flower ones are the cheapest Show me the motor tab. Swap the two props at the front
Wow i rly have ti busy with that stuff? When i get a drone i have ti find a club that shows me im not able to do that i think,"no. it flighs back now You are going to kill yourself if you try and fly indoors. Also, go do both of these  # props off that's the exact opposite of how it's set up in BF Oh, indeed, I'm too used to props being on reverse well you did ask for his screenshot too"
switch the front 2 again?,You reverse the two rear and two front props
the front 2 and the 2 back?,"1 goes on 3, 4 goes on 2. And vice versa Yeah, sorry, I'm just used to props always being on reverse dw, thx for helping. gimme a sec"
Did you fix your osd issues btw ?,"no, didnt help. switche them all now Does it fly now. And please test outside. Don't go punch a hole in your ceiling send a picture of the top of the drone. so we can see the props thats props in. you have it setup for props out iirc i helped him set up betaflight and it was props out. last time i saw it atleast. ah okay I think he reflashed his fc then. Also, do the motor reorder and the motor direction wizard"
are you using a belt as a battery strap??,Don't do that. Get a strap the belt is underneath your flight controller. what the fuck man. that is cursed spinning. need to click anythingß. i did reorder motors before. and saved
"Well, do they spin like betaflight is telling you they should spin ?",then click the ones that are wrong Then the ones that don't spin the right way you click on them Well now let's hope it didn't fail and then it should fly no. now it falls to the right side Well assuming the props are on right and you correctly reversed the motors it means that motor direction failed. Happens all the time
so check motor direction again?,"So you are going to have to directly connect to the esc, iirc with blheli_32 you need to download the blheli_32 configurator the motors in wizard spin in the wrong direction. even i changed them before to the right Yeah that's cause betaflight is kinda crappy at actually changing the motor direction reliably. It just fails every time"
is the belt really under the flight controller?,no no. u see weird things man
where then. is it under the esc?,"Go into motors. Yeah I'm not home idk sure looks like it's under the electronics. that's bad if you mount the battery at the top I'm going to let vitroid handle it if he has the time will change that after this problem. dont have a normal band rn if I remember correctly... open the ESC Setup tab, from there you will see one of the 4 ESCs and you can set it to normal or reversed mode. you need to click connect and read setup. with the ESC powered on from the battery. definitely take the props OFF if you haven't already Well that's odd. Since the esc you have should be blheli_32 Well now you can use esc-configurator.com. Mamba 45A something why is esc4 reversed. but rest is not Doesn't matter. Go back to the page before. Test all the motors to see if they spin correctly Yeah but do they spin in the right direction"
how i know which is the right one. this here?,Cause betaflight told you which have to turn how okay. no. wrong direction And you note which escs spin in the wrong way okay sec. 1 and 2. are wrong Select ``reversed`` for the esc 1 and 2 done. clicked write settingä And then i don't read German but one of them should say write. Yeah it. actually does. thx so much man now just need to find a fix for the osd but im finished. later
just activate another uart in betaflight?,You also need to solder the vista to a different uart solder the VTX to another UART. aww im always late
but there is only 1 uart or no? cant see another one,"There has to be others Oh, well you un solder the uarts from the vista. Then solder wires from the RX and TX of the vista to another uart on the FC"
"if im allowed to ask, what flight controller do you have?","ofc. its dji uh. sec. this here i just got into this hobby 2d ago, idk aynthing that thing in the frame. the top one The black thingy where you connected the vista to Theres defo another UART and since you dont need to connect a receiver, even one more F7 has like 8 uarts, usually 4+ of them are accessible UART 3, UART 4, UART 5 and UART 2 (DJI HD connector) oops. alright will try it. thanks so much  man. will go test fly now, maybe ill see u in some mins again with the next problem. :shrug: but ur osd isnt working ye And you will over discharge the battery cause no osd"
I want to built my own fpv copter (have an BNF) and is it possible to use Motors wich are rated for 50A with a 45A ESC?,nope. it says waiting for osd
did you fly already btw?,yes. and i wish i didnt
what motors and ESC are they? But in general that's a pretty bad idea,"An dem Punkt muss man auch einfach sagen **selber schuld**  Wir haben dir gesagt: Flieg nicht. Du wirst Sachen kaputt machen  Und wenn man so ignorant ist, und trotzdem fliegt muss man dann auch echt erwarten, dass einem irgendwann nicht mehr geholfen wird.. Nicht nur das, sondern dass fliegen ohne Informationen wie Akkustand auch sehr gefährlich sein können. Für andere Menschen, Tiere oder auch wenns nur Objekte sind. Fahrlässig nennt man so etwas glaube dem gras gehts gut, war weit und breit niemand Es geht um das Prinzip niemanden in gefahr gebracht, schlimmsten fall crash sie halt aber da leidet ja niemand drunter"
Es. Geht. Ums. Prinzip. They broke because of the crash or because of no OSD?,a wire of them was hitting the propelers and it cut them were you using the belt
Under the FC?. and ESC?,whats fc. just started into this 2days ago
where would i put the battery strap here? it was hard to even fit the fc and esc there,ofc. lemme turn on pc Also probably tighten the nuts on top more. but how i wouldnt be able to put nuts under it wich would make it less stable to the sides why is your capacitor peeking out it wouldnt fit othersise but with the battery pad on top it doesnt anymore just didnt put that on yet if you say so. but yeah you could also just cut the bottom gummies a little shorter Yeah so electronic things shouldnt stick out of the frame but if you tighten the top nuts more itll be fine but then the spacers get squished pretty hard wich i dont think is ideal theyre meant to be squished. its softmount but its not actually supposed to be thaaat soft ok if you say so ill try that later ``` set osd_displayport_device = MSP set vcd_video_system = HD save  ```
There is a way so that my quad puts out only so much motor output based on the lipo I plug in?  I plug in a 4s. But the quad only goes to like 85% output. Put in a 3s and it does 100% output?,"Nein (afaik), but I'm pretty sure you can just do a switch for it I know you can put that on a switch. Ya Well, it would be essentially the same thing I think you can set up profiles to switch depending on cell count"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlMaxtTPhK0. like this,Thanks man :sign_of_the_horns:
[lurn](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/994910474699280494.webp?size=48&quality=lossless&name=lurn),"I would think you might burn coils out faster doing that I mean using just a switch. Like a nitrous button. The voltage sent to the motor is the same if you scale accordingly (well, not really but the ""average"" voltage is the same). (average with """" since it's not really the average). (like, that's how our mossfets work basically they turn on and off the battery voltage to make a fancy curve, voltage is cut when the square thing is at 0, and it's on when it at the blue point, the blue point will always be battery voltage, and doing this really really fast makes it so the voltage that comes out is basically the red line, which will be the same since the cyclic ratio stays the same since with a higher voltage + motor output limit it will just stay on less time, but I forgot the name of the red line)"
"Since I only did this once, I forgot how I set up elrs on the controller side. How do I pass a binding phrase to the controller to match it with the reciever? (I know how to flash the reciever)","Same method, either build with a bind phrase and flash, or flash and set bind phrase in web config"
What do i use to charge my LiPo battery?,lipo charger. like a hota d6 pro alr just making sure i have it i forgot what it was called Thx
quick question. can you charge your phone with a lipo and how viable is it?,yes you can charge your phone with a power bank
so all I need is a xt60 to usb c?. or do I need like a power thinge?,usb-pd breakout board I have a couple of these doodads that have been very handy https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JBGLKRB
Ok!. But why is it working in the Helion 10?,"I only saw it in the Helion 10 where the ESC is rated for 55A and the motors have with 100% throttle and 1250kv a load current of 84A 84 per motor. or 84 in total. cause in that case itll be around 84/4. or is it motor testing I think it was in the datasheet of one motor i didnt look at any context. then no. bad idea Hey guys for the whoopstore I’ve been turning off charging to plug them in, do I need to do this or"
Do you think ifixit kits are good for drone repair and also other things? Or what other kits would you recomend me,"coped 2 of these and a charger upgrade I genuinely don't think the iFixit kits are of very high quality. if you have budget, get proper drivers from Wera and such. otherwise stick with iFixit How much we are talking about :D what happened to my drone"
You dropped it in a lake?. Depends on what you need,For every use other than drones also after spending days fixin it. crash was so nice its now split in pieces you broke a singular arm i glued it. flee again oh my god. :picardfacepalm: you cant superglue the fucking arms
u guys think. DJI Air 3 Fly More Combo. this is good?,an arm is like 7 bucks man i just started 2 days ago. lost around 750$ dude. an arm is 7 dollars. did you crash the goggles and remote too or what can you show the drone
"i dont know how to build, melt and stuff. maybe there is someone who can build it and i pay that, or a place where i can but finished ones?","you take 6 screws out this is why you don't buy fpv kits off of people first of all you put the arm in. you put 6 screws back in not home, but the antenna is off, an arm is broken, propelers rip, and some wires disconnected. learned it now well the wires was a given with how bad of a job the person you bought it from did... the entire arm broke off and so the wires with it too It's actually surprisingly easy to solder if you take about an hour to learn how to do so with the right gear, and it's also cheap i sat today around 2hrs trying to solder a single wire"
what did you use. a shitty homedepot iron?,you also have a terrible soldering iron and 3mm diameter solder 3mm diameter solder isn't even solder. that's welding rod certainly looked like it it was as wide as your FCs pads
:shrug:. so you know where i can buy ready drones maybe?. brb,"why. its really not hard. if you just focus There's a few options: - Sell the FPV gear you have, buy new stuff with a tinywhoop. - Spend 80 bucks on hex drivers and a soldering iron and repair the drone with relative ease with us helping you For every use other than drones also. Or third option borrow :bardkiss:"
"I have SpeedyBee F405 V4. Top-left motor is not spinning (there is the first beep, but no second). It is FC to ESC wiring problem or software?","I am more of a guy that has more hex bits in a kit Wera sells kits. See if you can connect with esc-configurator and read the settings It says ""Failed reading ESC 1"" then the same for 2, 3 and 4"
battery plugged in?. good usb cable?,"3. buy another one, good one this time with ur ops, or pay someone to build a good one. wyt"
Able to recomend me one?,"it'll always break. so no, not really an option. learn how to fix your stuff, it's easy and cheap :PepeBigHmm:. burned over 700$ just to break it 1 day before flying to holidays, which was the whole reason to buy dis Oh, i forgot. Now it reads all the settings"
Yes and if you literally had 60 bucks in tools you could fix this within an hour.. Are the settings all identical? Does the motor try to spin or not move at all?,Fixing stuff is way more fun. You have good oportunity to fix something i dont have because i dont have much to fix on a tinywhoop
What did you even break? :thinking_face:,"too much, and all of that work just for custom ODS still not to work"
Idk some just enjoy flying but not Repairing/bulding. I enjoy more suffering (Repairing). Just a question are you planning on selling it?,"probably, maybe finding someone on ebay who can use all that. digital hd camera and shit is working just need to some rewiring and new arm. i tried. yes"
Did you not read any of what I've said?... you don't have the proper tools,Idk just asking i have nothing to fix...
what do you think i could sell it for? or do you think i should repair it first and than sell it,"repair it then enjoy the hobby Repair it and use it. I mean if you just really really dont want to Repair it i bet you can find somebody locally thinking about buying a compact one from dji instead so yes maybe ill repair it, but selling it anyways https://tenor.com/view/cat-knead-fast-massage-gif-19678816. which i need a Pinecil, 63/37 solder from MG Chemicals/Kester/Stannol, TS-BC02 tip, brass solder iron tip cleaner (gold colored), no-clean flux, a set of hex screwdrivers. and if you can get some solder wick"
Wick is my life saver. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what do you think about this?,"definitely not. cheap metal will break your screws and waste your money. you need brand-names for this kind of stuff Oh okey. And able to recomend me that set please i am not sure what i shoud pick I can't because I don't know where in Europe you can buy from buy a set of wiha metric hex drivers on amazon and call it a day I mean just name one you like i ll find one :D Wera driver set. or wiha if you want smh I mean the one is like you have an handle and you exchange the whole thing that has screw driver oh.... I don't really know then, I don't use those for smaller tools.. but I'm guessing Wera has those too Wera is used more in cars and those I mean like bigger parts. I do wirh tiny small parts. So ig ifixit no... Wera also has for tiny small parts Ye ik but ifixit is for phones = tiny parts yes but wera also is. more so than ifixit with their thicc screwdrivers"
Ifixit price aint the lowest. Do you know what is anti static for? Do i need it?,for sensitive devices. you shouldn't need it Nah drones are better buddy I think buddy finally decided that drones are better than that
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) you meant these thicc screw drivers?,yes they're frankly unwieldy
Do you think the bigger is only bigger or is different from the smaller one?,Even the smaller one is unwieldy. it's hard to get into slightly tight spots because of the thick rim. that's why I prefer standalone drivers Planning on buying those also because i use hex pretty often Lemme checj. Mako Precicion set. Ye Ye i was thinking about it too This is good stuff imo. Has everything you need their drivers are meh
Did you ever need a bit that this set didnt have?,"I mean i see it as it has pros and cons Why do u think that. I mean for this price its good They use far cheaper material than companies like Wera do. to the point that they'll slowly degrade and break But Wera is like far more expensive isnt it Yeah my 1.5mm driver bit is already rounded yes but it is also BIFL. which is the point of tools Can you please send me a link to a set with every bit I need I can't because again I don't know where you live and I can't navigate those sites :loudly_crying_face: I mean Emilia. Nah just your site whats the name of the set called. Ima search it up He meant like you choose what you would buy and he doesnt care about country Wera makes ""micro packs"". big ones, or specific ones for specific kinds of heads. <https://www.amazon.com/Wera-Kraftform-Micro-Big-Pack/dp/B07X7JSBHG/>. they also make fancy allen keys. and tons of different bit drivers if you do want to use bits. in various sizes"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what abour DELOCK. https://www.reichelt.at/at/de/praezisionsschraubendreher-set-130-teilig-delock-64167-p325893.html?PROVID=2807&gad_source=1&&r=1,"probably some random brand. and for that price, none of that can be good I heard wiha is also good. https://www.amazon.com/Wiha-75958-Piece-GoBox-Precision/dp/B0BLWJW8WH/ wiha is good too yeah Too spacy and also its easier to put bits it's not it rolls up very tiny. and it was an example. you can get tiny kits Seems really good but that price for that much sus Ye ik but i am that type i prefer bits well they make bit drivers. like I said. in various sizes For that price that much"
Shoud i get solid or chsngable?. Little bit more and you have ifixit wirh more bits,Imma use my ifixit until those parts that I need are broken and then I will replace the broken bits with wera or  wiha ones I dont think its good because it could come loose if you are trying to screw something Or these. Looks cool definitely I wouldnt go for looks haha
Are there and LED frames for the Meteor75 bc i think it would be cool?. What ar those,ive got these. they good. same price on amazon tho they arent high quality. they fine tho Yes ik but for that price ya. u get what u pay for. they work fine Maybe but it will really affect the drone because of the weight bro i thought they were antenna mods for goggles :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: eh its alr i can deal with reg. ik. they kinda look like it tho You can solder up there led bit mind that it will affect the drone even a gram what about a milligram ik im a 200IQ sigma I know a way that doesnt add a single gram Just dont put there the led :)
bru..... its alr the reg frame looks good to blue is my fav color but im adding a black and grey frame. wait or should i just spray paint it?. Imma just spray paint it'll be free,I mean. You will see a tiny dot in the sky and your friend will say oh i see its blue
How did i find a Meteor75 for the same price but 1080p and mine is 720p?,I mean 90% of the time nobody minds the color. Skill The 720 p you got from where Maybe its a spelling mistake. Typing error. Idk no its the pro vs non pro i didn't see that part
But its still the same price?,ye. 120.99 for the pro and same for the non pro. way more expensive. on amazon yes :skull:. amazon over prices their stuff 127 with 2 batteries + tools
should i get the pro if i want to fly in unfinished houses in my neighborhood and inside my house?,yeah thats the thing i dont need that stuff bc i already have it. all i need is the drone
should i get the pro if i want to fly in unfinished houses in my neighborhood and inside my house?. for the same price btw,I am not sure about that i dont own one
ooh. u use the mobula7?,I assume pro is more for outside :person_shrugging:. Yup
yeah thats what a mod said and said i shouldn't get it. how is it?. and what headset?,Mid. Skyzone sky04x pro its expensive one dang it. im gonna have to use the Ev800D :loudly_crying_face: Ngl drone alone is 113 bucks ppl said the quality sucks with that what about when i see vids and they have all of those words on their screen Either you will be fine with analog or you will wanna go digital for the quality is there a way to turn that off Yep betaflight has full GUI You can place and turn them off Analog tv from 90s and digital just good quality. Both
im guessing Ev800D is analog.... right?,Yup. I mean my eyes doesnt need high quality dang alr maybe i can get a diff one iff i can take this as a hobby i have a lot of good places to fly too This analog btw but on my expensive goggles. What you wan a get
Digital goggles you mean?. Or,If you wanna go digital there  isnt cheap option Either you buy hdzero the Best digital or you buy dji i woud say Best image
Just check our prices and you ll see. Hdzero goggles i think 900?,900 bucks :fearful_face: Sorry my bad. 600+ shipping. + 4 antennas
i found the Beta FPV VR03 goggles are they good?,"Over 100 bucks at Total if you wanna little quality 4 antennas. I payed 80 bucks for 3 antennas for my goggles. My friend has them not worth it to buy i just want a good pair of goggles that aren't 10,000 bucks. like 120 at most. even tho i don't think you can get better than ev800D with that budget Cobra x take it or leave it. When i started i was asking this same questions... I wish...... thats just too much over my budget Between ev800d and cobra x there isnt any goggles. Ye but worth it. That will be cents when you get seriosly into the hobby i am just getting my beast gaming pc this or next week for free. hold up i gtg be right back in like 10-15 min I gotta sleep its 2 am :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"
Anyone have any tips to make drone footage look less pixely?,"What they do by the way i can do in simulator almost the same after 4 days so i quess real life much more difficult @Hollyfut you linked 2 diff types of drones, ones a camera drone and ones fpv (a shitty fpv drone but an fpv drone)"
"You are limited by the quality of the camera, so... it depends?",Like video recordings from a drone camera of outdoor scenery
Is there a way to increase the distance i can fly my FPV before it goes static?,"More resolution does not automatically mean more better. Crappy lenses, crappy bitrate, crappy sd card, crappy *flying*... all of these are also factors at play. Yes, depending on what hardware you have, what hardware you are willing to change, and how much money you're willing to throw at the problem"
How much range are you getting right now before you get static? What antennas are on your goggles? What goggles do you have?. You aren't changing any hardware on the drone itself. Just... you aren't. Not on a quadcopter that small.,"idk what range i have the EV800D there bad ik i just started Well I sort of need to know what range you're getting right now in order to know if it's ""normal"" or not. A meteor75 is already not going to have a ton of range because of its lower power output, small size, and extremely limited battery option. On top of that, the EV800D doesn't have a great receiver, and its stock antennas are barely passable as antennas.. So if you're getting 100m, I'd call that good. If you're getting 200m, I'd call that fantastic. If you're getting 10m, that's a problem. i'd say im getting 70-90m i don't rlly focus on that i just sit there admiring the view Well you also need to be aware of where you're flying, relative to your head. The EV800D comes with a flat patch antenna that only ""works"" if the front face is pointed *at your quad*. Directional antennas like patch antennas are useless when they aren't pointed in the direction of your broadcast signal (e.g. your aircraft) yeah i fly close to where i am ill will be sitting in unfinished houses in my neighborhood and fly around the house. also like a park or an open field Since you're in a residential area you should also be aware that wifi stomps all over FPV analog footage because they both use the 5.8GHz band No, like trying to hear someone talking at a concert Think of it like this Your little drone is trying to you from across the room at a rock concert, where the music is so loud your ears are bleeding. Your FPV signal is very susceptible to being ""drowned out"" by all the wifi noise in your neighborhood"
WiFi can be messed up by noise?. ohhh,You can minimize the effect (but not eliminate it) by moving to channel R8
is it tru bc i saw a guy and he put a micro sd with a downloaded more power to his drone and got more range is that tru?,he put a chip in his goggles that apparently had a thing that made his drone output more freq which made his drone go farther That's... not an option in your case
oh. so just change the channel to R8 and see if it helps a lil bit?. right?,"Yea. Also, flying with objects in between you and the drone will also reduce your signal alr. Thx and sorry if i was being confusing Nw, there's a lot of new concepts when you're starting out, especially if you're not used to dealing with analog broadcast signal"
"just a question if you are buying an RTF kit from lets say race day quads and it has to go international, how do they handle the battery, does it go by ship?","Depends on how much you pay for shipping but generally yes. don't get an RTF kit though. get something closer to this. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639/1144567226670788639 ok, yea was just wondering cus i kinda live in the middle of nowhere checking it out now. mauritius. lipo batteries are practically impossible to find. very few people in the hobby and shipping is crazy"
yeahh wow. that's basically the definition of middle of nowhere huh. would ordering from AUS not be better?,"yea. idk tbh china does help aus i have never ordered anything from. its that. or i get something while overseas you should be able to get everything off of alie or banggood oh yea true, ill check the shipping from there, aliexpress has given me some crazy prices before. so ive done a bit a of looking, aliexpress works espeically for the drone i was looking at (the new iflight 5"" eco analog one) but the shipping for all the ev800ds is like 100 dollars"
what's your budget?. if you're willing to spend like quite a bit more consider the cobra x. the ev800d's have a battery in them and they're huge. and check banggood,"was looking at around maybe +-500 dollars, preferably cheaper. ok, tbh i would want something that i can use long term ight, i think i already have a lipo charger at home, i we got it for rc cars before the rc cars batteries died. could never tell if it was the charger or the batteries is it perchance. the imax b6 no it was some big grey thing. multiple charge modes and stuff. ahah found it"
Hello. Does tbs crossfire nano compatible with RM pocket elrs?,"no because one is crossfire and one is ELRS ELRS. Also CRSF and Crossfire are different things. oh. then what is CRSF a wired protocol, used for communication between radio and transmitter module, and between receiver and flight controller.. Originally developed by TBS for Crossfire's wired connection, but eventually it was adopted for wider use i was planning to use this FC https://betafpv.com/products/f411-4s-20a-toothpick-brushless-flight-controller-v5-blheli_s-bmi270. i wanted to use a RM rp4 reciever on it but it doesn't say it will work with elrs ELRS uses CRSF for wired communication. ELRS is the current go-to system for FPV stuff.  It performs great, is cheap and is maintained by the community.. There are currently two kinds of ELRS that you can generally buy - 2.4GHz and 900MHz.  The integrated systems (in a radio) are predominantly 2.4GHz.   2.4GHz has smaller antennas, fewer issues with interference (in europe especially), is faster and generally much more available.  900MHz gets a bit more range and penetration, but it's slower, a bit harder to get and has bigger antennas.   For most people, 2.4GHz is way more than enough.  This isn't like the oldschool 2.4GHz, this shit can do miles. Even tens of miles in clear air and with a good setup. Even more than that with higher power modules.  @Yankyboy5 @The GGManiackThanks for the explanation, i'll go forward with rp3 v2. gonna use it with a RM pocket RP4 is a good 2.4GHz diversity receiver. RM Pocket is a cheap, but good 250mW 2.4GHz transmitter rp3 v2, wrote rp4 by mistake RP3 is okay. not as good as RP4. but okay. better than a non-diversity receiver anyway. RP3 is Antenna Diversity RP4 is True Diversity @Yankyboy5"
@The GGManiackCan i use rp3 with single antenna?. will it work?,You should have both antennas connected to the rp3 at all times when powered or it will fry it. got it
What on it are you flashing?. The controller itself?  Its RF module?,"SD card is not ""flashing"" It is my buddys controller and he accidently deleted all the files on the sd card of the controller. and ever since that the contrller is not turning on"
which version and variant is it?. there's v1 and v2. and different transmitter options,"It's the V1 elrs variant @Yankyboy5 https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard/releases/download/v2.10.2/bw128x64.zip. make sure the SD card is formatted to FAT32. download that zip file. extract it. and copy its contents onto the SD card. you should end up with the SD having folders like FIRMWARE, SOUNDS, etc, directly on it (not in a folder) Done, but it didn't turn on. Same problem"
should i go for 3800kv or 4200kv 1507 motors for a 4s 3.5 inch freestyle build?,idk what all happened to it. at this point I would attempt to reflash the Commandos firmware over USB. you might want to ask for help in the EdgeTX server I did flash the tx module but didn't fix the problem
how did we get to tx module?. the radio isn't working...,remove the screws and you can access the tx module and connect to the usb c. that's where you flash the firmware from https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/iflight-commando/
> how did we get to tx module?. > the radio isn't working...,"The TX module is irrelevant, it has nothing to do with the radio itself working. the radio itself runs EdgeTX. and that's not booting right now so I'd suggest reflashing EdgeTX I want to spray paint my frame but do I need something else then spray paint like something that protects the colour not fading away You can add some clear coats if you want, it will make it a little more durable, but the paint will flake away with the crashes and just time, also, don't forget to make the surface rough with some low ish grid then high grid sand paper so the paint can stay on better"
think im finally gonna purchase my first ever drone bundle.. does this look good.   cam will be runcam polar (dji system) im getting this model due to its newer release and tremendous support. please change for mind for me if you feel like it  https://oddityrc.com/products/mage-pro-hd-vista-version-6s  https://www.ebay.com/itm/266403776021?chn=ps&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&mkcid=2&mkscid=101&itemid=266403776021&targetid=2392637326232&device=m&mktype=pla&googleloc=200679&poi=&campaignid=20548263588&mkgroupid=150803424622&rlsatarget=pla-2392637326232&abcId=9321674&merchantid=6296724&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD_QDh_xwEQZU-. https://www.adorama.com/us1810439.html,"other than the controller, yes. buy the elrs version of the mage pro, and then get a jumper t14/t15/t20, or radiomaster boxer, or radiomaster pocket"
everyone is reccomending me the boxer ill check it out. is it smart to buy the controller and gogs first and test out a sim first?,"What is the website that has alls stores you don't need goggles for the sim, but yeah that's a thing people do"
id probably end up getting them at that time . the goggles do work for the sim correct?. https://www.getfpv.com/radiomaster-boxer-radio-transmitter-4-in-1-multi-protocol-cc2500-elrs-2-ghz.html,"You don't need goggles for a simulator, and doing that is very much not worth the headache. Controller is enough for the sim i just thought itd be a goodway to feel fpv in the beginninng and understand how to connect controllers to goggles You don't connect the goggles to the controller yep, just make sure to get the ELRS version"
"So the drone is a 3” prop running a 6s? In personal experience, that is gonna be a bit much. Up until recently, people only ran up to 4s on 5” drones… oh well idk exactly, it might be fine… just don’t fly it under a chair, as the weight of the drone has a lot of inertia even at low speeds, even lightly tapping something might shatter the CF and cause a cascade of things to happen. Anyways maybe that brand is better than geprc, but I would still be cautious","I mean, there are plenty of examples of 6S 3"" quads at this point--even Emilia just built one. 2650kv is low even for a 6S 3"" IMO, so it shouldn't be too crazy"
where do I need to solder my flywoo buzzer?,"Ah it might have been a 3.5. Still though yeah it was on a grinderino frame 6S isn't restricted to 5"" and 7"" absolutely, and for the kv 3000kv would be more appropriate for 3"" 6s. oh well also it's for a cinewhoop so 6s isn't super surprising. well if you plan on never actually flying it will be good, cause you also need batteries and a charger, plus, a cinewhoop sucks at everything except doing cinematic indoors or when you film somebody close so you don't murder him when you crash into him, also that radio sucks Prob 5v, ground, and buzz+ or buzz- (depends on FC and manual) I just know I had a 6s 3.5” and the battery weighed as much as the drone… a 500+ gram 3.5” (with bat) just has too much inertia… and I also didn’t know how to fly it but that’s a different story"
What battery did you put on it ? Cause a 250g 6s pack sounds like a 1500mah 6s. Which is about 3 times too big,"Yeah that's way too big. You want 650mah I just got what was recommended in the desc :loudly_crying_face: Well, they were either stupid or you just asked for a 6s battery without specifying the quad Nah in the drone description it said recommended battery 1300mah and the drone was a 6s"
Oh. Was it a cinewhoop ?,"Yeah. Maybe we should take this to #off-topic or smth Well that explains that. You don't want more than 850mah 6s on a 3.5"" cinewhoop"
My freestyle drone weighs about 740 grams with the action cam. Is that a bit too much weight? I use HQ V2S props and 2207 1960KV motors,It does say 1050-1300mah but I went for the max Well it was a mistake on both sides then
Should I use a 1350mAh lipo instead of a 1550mAh? I could save 30g of weight,If you don't have the 1550mah yet then yeah. But exact weight doesn't matter that much Might as well use the smaller ones when you have the hd cam on will the flight time be a huge difference
and when I do PID-Tuning should I do second profile for the 30g difference?,"Maybe 10% if all else was equal Your pid tune is almost certainly not good enough for it to care about 30g. You would need to be like UAVtech to pull off a tune so good it will care about such a small difference in weight okay. are you using a preset or a pid tune of your own I use the default pid tune I fly half destroyed props all the time, I don't care that much about the *perfect smoothness* of a good tune"
I think the following tutorial is a good one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-XRUZbvgpk&t,"Idk. I don't even know how to tune ah. it will be fine i guess haha well I know how, I just don't have the technique. cause I never tried he is flying like a god. i think he knows what he is talking about but it flies well enough. those two things are not correlated. at all damn  then imma have to watch all of chris rosser videos rip cause like, I fly like shit, I'm pretty bad, yet I am an absolute genius (it's sarcasm)"
For a 5 inch 4S quad -  what would be the ideal motor spec? 2206/2207 |  2400kv?,"I'd really recommend going 6s, but for 4s I'd go with 2207 ~2700kv"
"I was flying a 5inch 4S. Never flew a 6S. Should I really go for 6S? I'm not very good at freestyle, can do power loops, rolls, and maybe a half baked split-s etc",yes go 6s. it just flies a lot better. there is a reason why we all use 6s Last weekend I flew a friend's Pavo35 6S. Felt the power but I think a freestyle frame is much better. I am contradicting myself hehe
"My fpv feed used to be good and now it’s shitty… (analog) and the only thing that’s changed is normal flight wear, and the antenna got chewed up a little in the props, but it’s progressively getting worse even after I mounted the antenna away from props… is the gradual degradation the VTX? Or antennas need upgraded?. I say antennas because my goggles have antennas too",Mostly the antennas.. A good antenna goes a long way Yeah I’m using stock…
"What type of antenna...? I'm using foxeer lollipop rhcp antenna, and it's much better than the stick type (don't know what we call it) antenna","Idk. Stock antennas… asked in shopping advice for antenna recommendations I think you should change the antenna on the drone Keep in mind that a 1500mah 4s on a 4s build will get similar flight time to a 1000mah 6s You answered my question even before I asked it, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Lots of people get confused and think 6s batteries cost more, but when you compare watt hours instead of amp hours they are basically the same price and weight Yes I understand that. More voltage & same current means more Watts delivered! :thumbs_up:. So may be 6s it is... Yeah me too… sad thing is tinywhoop.com is out of antennas rn… all out of stock. Like literally all their antennas…. I’ll check some other sites"
@Vitroid are the iflight xing2 2207 1855kv 6s worth it ?  i will see much difference from these  that iam currently using XING-E Pro 2207 1800KV ?. 5' build,"don't get those motors, get the 2306 version, they screwed up when doing the 2207 and the 2306 outperforms the 2207 version, but either way you won't really feel a difference. the difference from one motor to the next is just a few percentage points. not really worth changing all 4 motors for a minor upgrade just doing a new build, trying different components oh, well in this case get the 2306 xing2"
Should i also paint the batts?,"you *only* want some m10 gps. m8 sucks. I mean, if you want, I wouldn't paint anything since it will get scratched off anyway It would be *aeathetically pleasing*"
"having a nice looking quad ? sorry, I forgot what this means","+100 Get M10. I was using RUshFpv M10, cheap but worked like a charm. Rescued the quad at least 2 times it's not so much that they are more reliable, but that they are soooo much faster to lock gps. with an m8 we had the time to go back home, drink a cup of coffee and come back, then change the batteries and we would have 8 gps, with m10, you plug it in, put the goggles on and you already have 20 Yes, it acquires 3D fix in no time and at least 9 satellites real quick. I have seen upto 32 sats."
What are oscillations?. Like whats the sound of it,"That depends on how bad the oscillations are, and in what part of the loop. But an oscillation is just a vibration, or a constant noise or movement that goes up and down"
Like when i try to stop real fast and it vibrates?,Yes that would be an example of oscillation. How to fix that depends on the exact context and circumstances
Ah thanks. I wanna tune D Term Lowpass 1. I need to find out min cutoff freq and max and I didnt know the term oscillation haha. i think i did a pretty good job for first time pre-tuning. @DædalusFPV is there anything that looks abnormal?,"Not really. You do have some ascending noise, but it isn't very strong here with the slider at full. where do you see that. and how can i fix that You don't need to crank the scale slider on this chart okay. is the vertical line at around 170Hz the ascending noise It's this, and you'd fix it by setting a gyro dynamic LPF to cover it. You do have a specific spike of noise at 170Hz that you'd fix with a notch filter do i need to set q factor higher or lower You don't need the dynamic notch for the noise at 170Hz. Use a static notch, center 170, cutoff 150 Actually it looks more like 180 or 190 to me"
what should i set at Gyro notch filter 1. center freq to 170?. i mean 180-190,"Make sure that noise is actually at 170, it really looks more like 180 or  190 to me. That'll be your center frequency Then set your cut off 10 or 20 hz below that Alright so the center is 205. And since it has a spread of 40hz, you can set the cut off 10hz below the start. So 175 okay. as for the ascending noise do i need to lower q factor or higher it"
and gyro lowpass 2 is not needed right?,"Leave it set as is for now. PID and filter tuning is best done a little bit at a time isnt it only anti aliasing filter. uh it wont let me change You have to untick the ""use slider"" effort for that side.. (I think) Yea if you use the slider, all of the settings are automatic. You need to disable the slider Been a week since I've used it..:KEKw: I both love and hate the sliders"
this should also do the job right? set gyro_lpf1_dyn_min_hz = 185,"Helped me get a 5"" flyable without any black box or internet, so not the worst idea.. That's the love part of it for me lol I don't like that I don't know what it's doing, under the hood though damn chris rosser filter tuning guide isnt as indept as i tought. @DædalusFPV do you have a better guide than chris rosser filter tuning guide Take a look at UAV Tech's channel; I like his explanations *way more* than anything Rosser creates"
yeah much better now lets go. alright thanks :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: but before I do that. is there anything else I can do for now to make it even better?,"Can't know more until you fly again and get more data. Like I said before, PID and filter tuning is a slow, careful process if you want the best results should I go crazy and fly my whole blackbox. like do loopings, mattys etc The best way to gather data to tune with is to fly it like you stole it Hard snap moves in every axis, long straight and sweeping moves, big throttle punches, the works okay. imma do that till 16mb  blackbox is full. ok didnt all 16 mb because lipo was getting low. @DædalusFPV I had many oscillations in this flight. did many snappy moves and very sharp turns with full throttle and low throttle etc"
Mind uploading the bbl so I can look?,"Honestly this looks pretty clean to me thanks for the help :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. then imma switch to pid tuning Honestly even that looks really good. There's essentially no bounceback that I see on snap rolls. I don't see the nose dip at all on throttle punches. One thing I do see is that motor #3 is really not performing as well as the others. It seems fine in most cases, but under full throttle it is maxxed out where the others are at 90%"
If vtx is smoked can it still send video? I am thinking if I smoked mine. I get video only when 10 meters a way and pointing to the drone direction,"It is possible for it to still be transmitting on some level, but you won't get any range Okay so mine is probably broken:crying_face: Where do you see that. I might aswell swap motor 3 if its only 90% Eh, there's always going to be one motor that limits the others If you start to notice problems, that's when I would switch it"
"But it still recommended to do some pid tuning right?. imo those values arent that great. roll respond aswell as pitch respond shoot up a bit too high. btw for pit tuning I should also fly the same way as filter tuning right? many youtubers say stuff like go to angle mode and then do pitch and roll left and right, up and down for about 30 secs","Yea I mean there's no harm in going through the process. No PID tuning definitely needs more exercise than filter tuning. Filter tuning is just taking care of mechanical noise problems in the system. PID tuning is the actual control over the motors, and how finely that system does the job okay so I should be doing all sort of movements in all directions etc right Yea pretty much what you did on the last flight"
"flying normal, fast, snappy etc. okay. @DædalusFPV do i need to do another profile with another custom PID tuning aswell as filter tuning when I am not using the action cam?","You can, how much that is necessary will be up to you okay. i mean 100-120g difference is a lot lol ik that. what radio.. itd be elrs 2.4  btw what batteries would u reccomend. the charger should be hoda correct. batteries as in what brand Look at the latest offerings from Radiomaster and Jumper for a radio. Hota D6 Pro charger. Batteries from GNB, CNHL, Tattu, or Dogcom"
I can get any Capacity lipo for my drone as long the drone holds it ye?,"kinda. as long as it has enough to not die instantly and not to big its to heavy like if you run a 5 inch 6s with a 450mah lipo. soon as you add throttle. it will die If i put on my tinywhoop 10k mah lipo would it work (lets talk that drone can hold the weight) If I had to be my annoying self technically a 5"" on 6s can be powered by a 450mah and still work fine, not for very long but the battery will probably survive. It will get power but it won't fly it will probs run down to 3.5v after a few seconds tho"
Ngl i am really bored and i cannot afford bigger drone so mods. Why?,"Man I couldn't even run a 10,000mAh lipo on my 7"" It has alot of Capacity"
If I ask you to do a pull up of a 1000kg will you be able to do so ?. No,"The tinywhoop can't either Hmm i tought Capacity doesnt matter that much only voltage. Wait nvm its amps so okey Adding Capacity and voltage will both add more weight. More capacity means chonkier cells. More voltage means more cells bigger cells means more weight Is there a way to calculate how much Capacity maximally i can get You can't really calculate it. Well, yes but no techniclly you can with thrust ratios That's why the yes but no what size props and what motors We just have ""standardized"" battery size that works well instead of trying to put a 5000mah pack on a 3"" figure that out first Well then we can't really tell you what battery to use. Everything depends on which prop size you go with yea. once you choice the prop size then you can choose frame, motors, escs, batteries and more Which for some reason really confuses the camera drone people oddly enough, every time I talk drone size with one of them I have to do a 40 line paragraph about why we use prop size and not frame size Oh wait nvm i finished that project... My bad :dotted_line_face: i am doing an rc car Yea it is all on a curve, one would need to know the exact thrust curve of the prop, the load curve of the motor, then plug in the weight of the aircraft, and you end up with a curve with battery weight on the X axis and throttle to hover on the Y axis Yeah. But there isn't really a need for it since we basically figured out the ""correct"" battery range with trial and error over the years It's those pesky prop and motor curves that no one knows lol. Yea exactly Well, some manufacturers start to include it actually. Not a lot I hope more do, that'd be really nice But a few motors do have an actually nice curve with the thrust/efficiency and amp draw. Which is really nice. I hope more of them did it since the info is *already inside of the motor chart*. That they already made. They just need to plug it into excel A sliding efficiency chart with load on the X axis would be nice"
A *sliding* chart for the efficiency ? What do you mean by that,Where the peak torque efficiency is on the Y axis and the mass of the load is on the X axis
Where did you crash it?. could you show pictures of the AIO?,"Yo everyone , quick question. I crashed my mob 7 and now I just got black vid, no overlay... What can I do. I unplugged the camera and inspected everything it looks normal.. Oh haha it won't even connect to beta flight ... Aye carumba Kinda dirt... Driveway. It is on film also, is there anyway to have the fpv feed on picasim or any of the others, cause I just downloaded picasim and I don't see an option anywhere to have the fpv feed Oh haha I just saw you said aio , yea I'll pull it that's a lot of possibly wet grass. You should clean it up with some isopropyl and snap a picture without flash I'm not in front of my pc right now. If you figure it out, just ping me. Otherwise I'll check it out tonight ok, well, i'm probably going to go sleep tho since it's kinda late Ok cool will do.. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) here we go"
It looks fine honestly?. I don't know what that is though,"Let me take a look. I really need a microscope if I'm gonna be doing this... I mean first thing you can do is try and see if all the voltage rails are still alive if you have a multimeter I think that's an led It is, but the goop around it"
well that certainly has gone up in price. loool. I remember it being 10 or 15 bucks?,"Doesn't look like they've added any models from the last couple years either, that's a shame dev is active-ish on Discord though It was a small piece of foreign contaminant. How long  does the isopropyl take to evaporate https://discord.gg/XhQkZ66K. Depends on the percentage you got. but generally... extremely quickly 70 :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. It looks dry. That sounds good enough to me Well rip I guess jahah. Good thing I have a backup You click the eye icon to change the camera perspective from LOS to FPV or chase cam"
have you checked CNHL?. they often have sales too,"How many mah should I get on a 6s battery for freestyle For a 5"", 1100-1500mAh IMO I love how expensive the batteries are Speedy pizza are good batts for a good deal. And pizza No connection it beta flight . No driver loading.... Black signal on screen, no telemetry Good chance it just needs a new voltage regulator"
a whoop sounds good for me. werent you the one who reccomended me whoops?. https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/boxer-radio-transparent-version better radio?. ima send a full list of everything. ima purchase my radio and simulator first,I recommend you make a thread in #help-with-drones. Anything from RadioMaster or Jumper will be good. The Boxer with ELRS is great. make sure you don't forget the battery
my drone is reccomended 850 mah would u say thats something i should aim for?,"welp i guess ill to get roasted in the morning then! it looks cool. and i was reccomended it due to its newness and durability. my mind can be changed very easily. im open to any criticism. specs so far let me make the thread. just for reference to you CI35 probably performs better if you're doing outdoor stuff i heard the opposite but you may be correct unless the mage pro isn't 3"" its 3”. thats why i wanted it CI35 being 3.5"" of course"
if its right between the sweet spot for indoor cinewhoops and outdoor cinewhoops does that mean its a good hybrid?. id like to do a bit of both mostly outdoor. i want to do some cool drum shots indoors as im a live drummer,"It's probably too big for indoor stuff honestly, unless you try real hard"
most the time itd be outdoor but its probably gonna be on stage . or my fucking basement lol. thats the only time id do it inside.. will it preform bad outdoors?,"It should be good outdoors. but I know that the CI35 pretty much rips around like a freestyle quad. you also might want to consider walksnail id prefer it if they had a mage came with walksnail. thats the only thing drawing me away from the mage the xi25, xi35 have it. they seem much better and cheaper then dji in most ways yup. they're a bit worse penetration wise whats penetration. im sorry :disappointed_face: im hoping this drone will help me learn lol How well the signal goes through walls. and other objects"
ahh. is this a large issue with trees n such? when is this most likely a problem.. i think ima look into the xi35 now that u mention it,I mean most of them can handle a tree or two. but those evil things are filled with water and also jump in front of your quad to break it
ive never heard a tree called evil :face_with_tears_of_joy: are they all drone pilots enemy?,"Anything with water is my enemy, drones are magnetized towards water.. You could fly in a desert, and manage to crash in a puddle."
"Hello people! I am building a micro brushed motor fpv drone already have all the parts but the flight controller, I found this one and I want to make sure that I can connect an elrs reciever to it, I am new to fpv drones so im not 100 percent sure if it will. https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807086259058.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.6e597a9dA02C2q&mp=1&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt","might work. page says it runs betaflight 4.2 Okay, well there’s only one way to be sure. Thanks :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: if all else fails you can use sbus instead of crsf and just not have telemetry hey guys. so basically my friend has a l900 pro. and when he charges the battery full it doesnt even last in the air for 3 minutes because it auto lands saying the batteryis not charged. if anyone knows whats the problem then helo me sounds like bad battery. how many mah go into it when it charges and how many go out I’m going to be honest I have no idea what you just said :face_with_tears_of_joy: what voltage is it at at the end not what I asked. what kind of telemetry do you get that's just what the battery says. it might have been 2200mah new but obviously it's not now can you see voltage and current when flying"

Tysm Basically what has happened is the capacity has degraded with time so that 2200mah is now a 300mah"
ohhh i understand. but how does that happend?,"Why they almost definitely are, at 8$ for 3  (To give gioshhh  an idea our batteries are like 25$ each on the budget end) like i also have a toy drone amd this happend too It happens to all batteries, just like all people. We get old, fat, and have less energy."
so keep buiyng new ones?. is the answer?,"Periodically, yes, we need to buy new batteries. They don't last forever. You reduce the rate of this happening by charging correctly, and storage charging, which I doubt the cheapo charger for that does Plus for a dirt cheap drone like that, who knows how good the battery chemistry was to begin with, who knows how long it was stored on a shelf, etc etc if i remember i have a toy drone that has also this problem, i replaced the battery with a new one and a bit more powerful amd it still does auto landing You can only expect so much from cheap toys. Which is not much Well, if you want to have an idea of how long a battery last, well, our hobby grade Li-Po batteries, like even good ones where we actually cared for them and gave them a kiss before storage charging them, only last about 1 year before they loose too much of their capacity"
so every year = new battery?,"On very cheap batteries it will be much more often than that if you use them relatively often plus on these battery that these cheap drones use every month =new battery It's not this simple. How often you need to replace a battery depends on the quality of the battery, how much you use it, and how well you care for it Also toy grade stuff gives you very little info to diagnose this"
so if i leave my drine in the shelf too mutch  then the battery breaks?,"No voltages or currents or capacities yeah, I have some batteries that lasted like 2 months, others that are 8 months old and still perform like the day I bought them With a real charger you’ll actually see that the amount of energy it puts in reduces, because it can actually measure that All batteries degrade over time. How they are stored can greatly impact their longevity. If you store them fully charged (or fully *dis*charged) all the time, they'll need replaced very quickly. If you store them at 50% charge, that improves their longevity quite a bit I have some of the old BetaFPV 300mah from years ago and because I basically never flew them and kept them at storage, I still get basically the same flight time out"
"also, is it worse to keep batteries empty or full ? I was wondering the other  day","If you have to pick one, it's worse to store them full But that assumes that ""empty"" means 3.2V/cell no empty as in like 3.5v, like landing voltage I did not know this back when I was starting out with Flite test stuff and also I had one of those old 3-led brick chargers, so my batteries puffed basically immediately. Still got some fun"
so im gonna tell my friend to keep the batteries fully discharged. and low on voltage. so they cam survive a bit?,"well, you would need to storage charge them Oh well *definitely* better to store at 3.5V than to store at 4.2V. At 4.2V, the process of dendritic growth inside the cell is *much* faster than at 3.5V because of all the stored chemical energy."
ok. what is dendritic growth ?,"I don't fully understand what it is about the chemistry that degrades once you're below 3.0-3.2V, but obviously going that low damages the cells as well. I'm not sure where it is, but there's a point, I'm sure, that matches the damage done at 4.2V ok. well i'm going to look into it then Lithium dendrites are a sort of crystal that grow inside the cell when the chemistry is not in equilibrium. I'm not a chemist and don't fully understand why that happens, but suffice to say that eventually those crystals can penetrate the anode/cathode barrier and cause the battery cell to internally short circuit, usually causing a runaway exothermic reaction. Dendrites grow much more rapidly at full charge than they do at nominal charge, and they also grow very rapidly in response to heavy power draw Very rarely do these dendrites penetrate the internal barrier in a new healthy battery, but the growth is randomly dispersed and it does occasionally happen"
I would like to buy a frame where I can be at peace with it for longer. But I'm not sure which one I want. Does anyone have any experience with frames?,I'm very happy with my Manta 5
"Either of them really, are you sure you want a deadcat frame?","whats the pros and cons of deadcat compared to a normal x frame deadcat flies worse, harder to tune. but no props in view when you don't use stabilization I guess"
Is it worth getting DJI Care Refresh for my DJI Mini 4 Pro? Is there better insurance? Is it needed?,"Well, DJI drones are basically made out of cardboard and will self destruct when they touch a tree,  (Which is probably on purpose so they can make more money on your back with the repairs if we are honest with ourselves)  So I guess it is needed, but wait until somebody more used to camera drones passes by as I am mainly an fpv pilot"

Any parts I am missing?,"picture is pretty fuzzy. I don't see a flight controller anywhere Would that look like a circuit board, because i think there is one there just buried amongst the boxes My only experience around electronics building is putting together PCs and some basic soldering so i hope this is not any more difficult It made a bit more difficult by the fact you have old ESC's, bit more wiring to do and such You need to be good at small soldering, so no exposed wire and such. electronic speed controller. for the motors Might be learning curve then all you really need is a smaller iron tip and really good quality solder/tin Thank you so much for responding, i think ill have more questions when my plane touches down, I am packing all of these parts as luggage so with any luck they dont break during handling.

"I am using the pinecil v2 and using 55/45 lead/tin solder.   My pinecil shows its being powered by 19V and I have a 65W charger, however no matter how high I put the temperature the board wont heat enough for the solder to melt.  However If I put the solder straight onto the pen it insta-melts. Is the pinecil not reaching the temps its presenting? I have tried changing most settings in ‘power settings’","Just super glue it back up, no big deal Just kidding, it won't work, but you can swap the arm, just buy a replacement. Just put it at max W and 330°c-370°c and melt a bit of solder on the iron then put the iron flat on the pad to maximize surface area then add some solder, if it still doesn't work, maybe take a video so we can see if you do anything wrong, otherwise you can try with some 63/37 solder instead of some 55/45, it might work better"
Do you mean to change the W on the pinecil? The only option I found was QC setting which I put to 19 V. I am currently running at 450° C lol,"Don't run 450°c it's super high. And change the W if you can, idk if you can on the pinecil, just set it to 330-370°c and try to put the iron more flat on the pad Thank you for help but actually I think the issue is that my tip has oxide on it preventing heat from moving. Dont own a brass sponge yet unfortunately, must look up if there is DIY alternative A normal sponge that is a little wet. If you don't take care of your iron it will degrade fast"
"thats what I used, but I dont think that will actually remove oxide right?. yeah should’ve bought tool maintenance things too lol","It works as well if not better than a brass sponge from experience, a brass sponge is just more convenient"
If my tip is dark grey can I remove it with a sponge?. To get the shiny layer back,"Yeah, but that is most likely just some burned flux and you want to *always* have a little bit of solder on the tip so it doesn't oxide the tip when you let it sit or when it is used A green brillo pad works in a pinch too"
"hmm ok you’re probably right, so you dont think this is the cause of my joint not heating up?","always have solder on the tip and try to maximize the surface area of the tip that is in contact with the pad for maximum heat transfer and it should work. That's basically rust at that point. Poor thing, keep some solder on it frick my sponge was probably too wet then, was quite some water on it I believe lmao It's not because of the sponge, the water will just evaporate instantly. It's because you didn't leave solder on the tip I literally just used this for the first time 1h ago Well always keep solder on it, cause 450°c+no solder=bad time. At 450°c the oxidation is really fast. Your tip looks as bad as my tip that is 8 months old (that was used at 350°c and was loved) if you want a comparison yeah i really should’ve watched at least one turorial before trying this. Just winged it and figured if its not heating I gotta heat it up.  I’ll look into to see if I can remove this oxidation, good learning experience. Really never considered higher temp would speed up oxidation. Thank you friend Ok, also, ***do not use sand paper to remove the oxidation*** it will basically break the tip. Cause the (usually) shiny part at the end is just a thin plate of *some metal* that is different from the rest of the tip (I forgot the name of the metal, I think it's a nickel alloy)"
should i go for fpv first? or just a normal drone,"Different tools for different jobs,  A metaphor I like to use is that a camera drone is like a Tesla that will drive itself (without the crazy acceleration) and fpv is like a GT40 you drive on a track idk i love fpv cinematic shots. yea im more of a car shots person so ill go fpv Fpv is a fun race car, a camera drone is an easy to use car that will just let you watch the landscape i was there like a week ago and saw two drones that were filming it and now im locked in drones yeahh you want FPV then A camera drone isn't going to be able to do that do you think the apple airtag is going to cut it (with other gps finder) It doesn't have neither the power nor the durability. Just use a normal gps yea but i like the find my app You are going to fly far away from anyone anyway so an air tag won't work. An air tag works by talking to other apple devices And last time I checked rabbits don't use an iphone whad do you mean by rabbits rabbits are the only thing in an empty field. and they don't have any phones. also, air tag works with android devices too You know the little fluffy things that jump. And live in the forest now i get it. i thought you were making fun of me Far from people and stuff you can break. I make fun of everyone when I get the opportunity oh. i get it. youre the type of person to brag about something good beeing to expensive (it is) no his statement is more about morals or something 1200 usd. it aint bad It is about morals and not liking shitty companies Not so much about being an elitist hot take but android elitists are so much worse than apple elitists and you want to primarily do chasing stuff fun. is the answer. nah but chasing is good you should probably start out with a simulator and a transmitter yea. i need liek 5 bucks to buy controller. idk i love the dji design. call me etilist RadioMaster Boxer, RadioMaster Pocket, Jumper T20, Jumper T15, anything else from those brands with ELRS as DJI controller won't work for FPV but it is great. is there any controller like. controller. like ps5/xbox controller i just gave you a giant list They kinda suck most of the time. Box radios are better. And you don't hold a controller radios like a controller i prefer sucking controller than abomination of a cube You let it fall in your hand like a box controller I mean, the quickest of google searches would have revealed ""game pad"" style radios like the Jumper T Pro and Radiomaster Pocket What are you talking about, a box radio is not a cube, and the boxer is really ergonomic Ergonomics is king--can't see shit when you have goggles on, and no matter what you do you look like a dork standing in a field anyway. I say that as a dork that likes standing in fields dude. that is like. nothing we have mentioned. none of us have even mentioned the tx16s The tx16s is like the worse one stop acting so full of yourself It has the ergonomics of a brick. The boxer just conforms to the shape of your hand nicely hmm. i dont like those desings Assuming you don't have toddler sized hands, the boxer is amazing im sorry. they just look like a brick You won't see them dingus. You have goggles on when you fly And it will just be stored on your bookshelf where you won't see it anyway It's like 130$. Radios aren't that expensive anymore. (They used to be like 300$ for a budget one and like several thousands for a good one) like where do i get them for 130 usd Yeah well I am talking about real dollars. Anywhere you sure cut off the rest of the title Well, it won't be 130$ if you are in the eu https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/radio-boxer-elrs-24g-radiomaster-10582.html#/10115-version-sans_batterie"
+hdzero goggles. will it cut?,"Spektrum still overcharges for their high end ones <https://www.rotorama.de/product/radiomaster-boxer-elrs> Well, hdzero goggles are gonna be *expensive* I paid like 1k for my hdzero goggles + antennas + analog module. (€) Not if you are in the eu i forgot about antenas Eh, no one buys spek anymore. Well, also I didn't go cheap on the antennas, so you could get the price down by quite a bit Not in FPV but in RC planes"
"You could get them for 850€ if you get some x-air, some cores and no extension board. Oh, yeah, I forgot about the German cousin of fpv, did they not hear about elrs in the rc planes and cars world ?","too hard to set up and spektrum works great It's filtering in slowly--there are folks who are converting, but I doubt it'll ever get to a majority market share Holy smokes, that's their budget option https://www.spektrumrc.com/product/nx8-8-channel-dsmx-transmitter-only/SPMR8200.html. Yeah configuring elrs over wifi is so hard"
what's wifi?. that's how i have internet on my phone?. what does that have to do with my radio?,"anyway the zorro exists if you really must have a gamepad. as does the jumper t-whatever (I think lite and pro) Ok, well that's odd that it came in fpv like a cannonball and just beheaded crossfire and tracer almost instantly, but not so much in the other branches of the rc hobby. The zorro is a kind of meh radio the issue is everyone gets a spektrum UMX or SAFE thing as their first plane, so until a company starts making RTF elrs planes with gyro stabilization we'll always lose. I myself have been recommending people get FT Tutors and elrs stuff, or PNP stuff from FMS Can't they just use like a ranger t-1 overthere instead of being annoying also unfortunately, Flite test sells the *cc2500* radiomaster stuff in their all-in-one kits. even though they have elrs stuff in their store I guess it cuts a few dollars off their value bundle for people on a super budget. but then their power packs (motor, esc, servos) are a bit overpriced It cuts like 20-30$. If not less yeah. at least they switched to the pocket instead of the i6x I know micro/UMX and gyro-stabilized ELRS receivers are both in development, I have no idea where they are in the cycle though yeah. the issue is then the use case is buy a UMX then rip out the most expensive part to keep the foam lol. actually, they could go along with plans for cutting out of foamboard like flite test. I bet you could have some nice super-lightweight profile planes Well Horizon still has a stranglehold on local hobby shops, and will always sell UMX stuff with their receivers built in. I would *love* to see more PNP options from FMS, Bananahobby, Dynam, Arrows, etc We should never have talked about rc planes, I want to buy that and put an fpv camera on now https://www.bananahobby.com/7-ch-af-model-1-10-f-22-raptor-1-8m-71-inch-rc-turbine-jet-pnp.html Thanks for the advice. Patched Hey FYI last time someone did this. their entire drone broke :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: because doing this kind of crap actually has a good chance of breaking the expensive stuff inside so enjoy that. yes, it's also dangerous as it will probably explode fly +fireworks, I'm going to enjoy this yeah or you'll enjoy the hospital bill. this is stupid"
Did you not read the second part of my message where I said it won't work and it's stupid ?,Relax fellas I'm not strapping a C4 to it Well I guess if we never hear from you again we will know why
any idea what these are?,"Probably sma nuts, you put them on the sma so you can tighten it more easily"
does anyone know if there is a bf cli command to switch off the i2c connected baro and use onboard again?,"there is, but we'd need to know a lot more details. @Jakobus without knowing which I2C bus is which, I can only tell you that it's this command:  > set baro_i2c_device = 1 > save. where 1 is the bus number"
So I have Lipo battery charger 450mAh 1s 4pck battery Meteor75  Ev800D goggles Radiomaster controller  Is there anything else i need for my first FPV build??,"if only we knew which charger and which RM radio you were talking about oh Vifly whoopstor3  and ELRS sorry i forgot if only we knew which RM radio you were talking about cause elrs is an rc protocol, and all RM radios can come equipped with it"
huh i don't get it?. explain it but like to a kid with down syndrome. im new to this stuff,"this is a boxer, and this is a pocket, elrs is how the radio speaks with some magical rf waves to the quad the ""language""/protocol the radio uses has nothing to do about the actual radio. it's just about how the waves  comming out of the radio looks like and which rf board is inside"
like R8??????. i rlly don't get it,"r8 is a channel, it stands for ""raceband 8"", raceband being the band, 8 being the channel im not tryna be funny i really don't get this. its like learning PC's all over again. sorry dat is called a pocket, a radiomaster pocket, it's the name, that's I want to know about your radio,  elrs is the way the radio talks to the drone,  it's like you have emillia and ian, both talk english but they aren't the same person,  the pocket and boxer both use elrs but aren't the same radio, elrs or Expresslrs is just the RF portion of the radio, inside of all our radios we have a (usually) seperate board that handles sending out an rf signal to the quad and receiving rf from the quad (the telemetry), and the protocol (cc2500/crossfire/elrs etc) dictates what the rf board is, that's all. i'm not trying to be funny either ok, well that's what I wanted to know, that your radio is a radiomaster pocket with elrs"
you wanted to know that its a radiomaster with elrs right?,"I wanted to know that it is a ***radiomaster pocket*** that has elrs onboard :neutral_face:. i said that.... this. i said it was elrs you just said it had elrs, which is *not* what I asked I asked for the name of the radio, in this case a radiomaster pocket no. cause you didn't say it was a radiomaster ***pocket***, radiomaster makes multiple different radios yk what just forget it its good"
Do you have a crossfire radio system?,"i have a crossfire radio system Crossfire receivers by default output CRSF, but can also output SBUS if I recall correctly. i built this car a long time ago. i want to rebuild cars again :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. with drone parts For Receiver to FC communication, CRSF is preferred over SBUS. but either will work i built a drone this weekend i used CRSF, but i'm really bad at soldering i'm affraid with will just fall off the sky, at least with cars there isn't that risk. hmm there's crsf for arduino. i guess that's a project for my weekend"
"I’m building a hovercraft and I need to control the lift fan with one of the knobs on my radio(as it stays constant and the pushing fan is separate) however I don’t know how to configure it in my radio(radio master boxer) I can get it to control the motor but it does nothing till the halfway mark then goes full throttle. It looks like the channel and input are set up the same as the throttle channel so I’m not sure why it’s acting differently. I’m struggling to find any documentation on how to set up a throttle with a knob instead of the throttle stick, any suggestions?","Should be exactly the same, perhaps your esc isn’t calibrated"
Why does my old battery charger call me the nword and say or error when I try to quickly charge batteries? (I'll dm a picture of said message if that helps),I'll send the image to you in dms if you want. dont want to just post it here and get fucked over bc of it
"hey everyone, on mobula7 what do you think of this video ? https://youtu.be/x7jvhWT2rX0. i swapped cameras. so its not the camera must be the board ..",well I coulda told you that.... it was never the camera if both the literal signal and the OSD is affected
maybe?. It's really weird,I guess I'm rough on my stuff...
Its an aio... Can you set the channels on that? It's just factory.,of course. and you need to manually set it on your goggles too. not autoscan
I got it.. it was the new aio. ive got the cli stuff going... standby.. you fixed it!. what in the heck though?,analog video is wacky cool lesson learned thank you I recommend you use Raceband 8 for tinywhoops lower frequency = more penetration (don't know how much it happens with this little difference but still). but R8 is picked because it is as far away as possible from WiFi ok im looking... at this closer.. ok band 5 ch 8 5917. now my  theory was that the antenna had the lowest swr at 5665 there for had better tx. i live in the country the only wireless out here is mine. then you can check what channel your WiFi is on hmm yea. i do have a few things going on as far as that goes but ill just go with r8 for now.. Thank yo so much for your help.
is it worthwhile getting separate VTX for tinywhoops if im not planning on racing rather than buying replacement AIOs as I chew through them?,BetaFPV 5A + VTX can be pretty much as light as an AIO with a VTX in it. just get the BetaFPV 5A
"awesome ty, are separate VTX boards relatively compatible? like would I be able to add this one to betafpv 5a? https://geprc.com/product/geprc-rad-whoop-5-8g-vtx/",yeah. I'd get a Happymodel one. or some fancy RUSH one or whatever
"good to know, one more q please, would I be able to solder on a separate vtx on a AIO that has a burned up integrated vtx on it without issue?","Should be possible, heavy though... some AIO's have little jumped solder pads to disable the VTX. right the weight. this is great thanks so much!"
Ah I see. Yea. Can you get the 25 movin fairly well still?,"Do we like the cinelog 25  I want to carry a runcam thumb, through small places and around people Goood. Was looking at the 35 but I’m not paying £90 when a 6S AIO goes bang :face_with_tears_of_joy::loudly_crying_face: 35 is overkill for thumb pro Well also the 35 is a very different tool. It's more suited at like outdoors chasing with a full sized GoPro on Won't be as agile as a 5"". But it won't be too much of a brick either Yea obvs it’s a brick either way prop guards wasn’t expecting to trippy spin it And it's still a cinewhoop so don't expect too much acro from it Yea I doubt I’ll really ever flip it around. Just to get nice videos on holidays n stuff"
why would you failsafe just when you are about to hit something?. i think the only thing you need to take account for is that your quad doesnt drop at stage 1,"About Geprc mk5. How badly do I need a gps and can I 3d print colors of geprc I don’t like green ones You don't need a GPS for anything, and you can print custom parts if you get the STLs for them. A GPS unit is kinda like an ""extra"" part that can be used for GPS rescue, but it's not necessary for flight To expand on what vitroid said, a gps for freestyle will essentially only be useful to tell you your ground speed, it is mainly used for long range flights so you know in which direction you are, how far away you are and the total distance travelled, as well as the altitude if you add a barometer, which are all pretty useless for freestyle Anyone here that flys 7"" or 10"" long range drones.   Got a question regarding the stage 1 failsafe settings  in betaflight.  Stage 1 setting for throttle limit, I've always followed Bardwell video on this and I set it about 5-8% above my actual hover limit.    I just watched a youtibe video on gps rescue this morning and he has his stage 1 throttle at 1700 nearly max. His reason for this is that you want your quad to flip over and punch out immediately from any potential hazard before it enters gps recuse.   Now to me that make alot of sense, but I'm now conflicted. Do I set it at 5/7% of my throttle limit or go up as high at 1700!.   What's your thoughts. Not when your about to hit something, the idea is that when you hit that button gps rescue. Your drone instantly flips over in angle and punches up but then  I still don't understand why it should do a punchout I flew quite a bit of lr, and personally I set it at about 50-60% with a hover at 30% so it shoots up, but it's still is low enough so it doesn't enters the really low efficiency zone of my motors and just empties my battery,   In my experience (and opinion), the right value is in-between the two, not at 5/7% above hover cause if the battery is flat the quad will just fall (since the delta of voltage between a full li-ion battery and an empty one is very high), or take ages to go back up and the battery will empty before it's at the desired height,  but not at like 100% throttle (or any high throttle value) cause the amp draw/throttle position curve of a motor is exponential so it will draw a lot of current from the batteries and if you were kinda low it can actually just empty the battery and the quad falls out of the air midway through coming back, it actually almost happened to me once. Cause when you have a failsafe it's often because there are obstacles around. And that those obstacles blocked the signal and the quad can potentially hit those same obstacles The quad doesn't just see the rock, freaks out and failsafes Thanks for that bro. It's much appreciated. It actually makes alot of sense now that you think about it. I'll go through my quads and get that changed!. I always thought that the 5/7% is a bit low. But it's Bardwell so u trust it :p Do a few test runs tho, the good value for me might not be the same for you, especially since I mostly flew ul lr quads, which might behave a bit differently to the chonkers we usually use for lr, and you could plot the motor amp draw on a graph if you want to do it in a more analytics fashion,  Cause with our motors, when you get to the very low efficiency zone of high throttle, you can add just a little bit of throttle and you get like 1.5x more amp draw. I mean, I find myself often disagreeing with Bardwell honestly. I mostly stopped watching his videos but I had a few issues with him mainly with lr and micros iirc,  I don't have exact examples tho It just clicked the way this guy put it in his video and it makes so much sense having that higher throttle limit for that 1 or 2 seconds during failsafe. Stage 1"
guys whats wrong with my drone?. :shrug:,Did you try ; Using real components Or using #memes
I'm currently ordering some stuff for my 2.5 FPV on Ali. and I need an adapter that goes from xt60 to xr30. I assume that the connector for the balancer will be different? If so does anyone have a good product on eBay? And can I get good lipos with an xt30 connector on Ali?,"Nope. ELRS communication isn’t secured and isn’t jam resistant. Data over the air isn’t encrypted, and there are no special security measures. Crossfire is the only one that has data encryption elrs doesn't and won't ever use encryption because they were very clear a while back that they didn't want their system to be used in a conflict, and if the data isn't encrypted it can't be used for war, so they won't encrypt it,  tho, if we are honest with ourselves, you ain't going to fly over the pentagon with a drone from the kgb, so you don't need data encryption If I want to extend the wires on my motor what kind of wire would I need to look for."
"@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) quick one mate, on your long range quads, do you recall what you had your decent speed per meter second set at?","Again from the bardwell guide to some other tutorials im seeing that difference is massive.. decend rate in meters per second on your long range quads. idk, I left that on default, it worked well enought where as bardwell has it at like 26mph. ok cool. I thought 21 seemed a bit high :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I guess use 10m/s so it doesn't smack into the ground. idk, I never really had issues with it What is the difference between the racing and the freestyle air65 and is the air65 a good drone"
There is a difference in motors and Pod tuning. Does your radios also fall often? :bardwell:,"Idk what that means sorry Ohh that may explain why I see crossfire being used so much in Ukraine. was wondering why cause it's more expensive and worse.. Ty for the answer the racing has stupid props that were never meant for 0702 and 27000kv motors, the freestyle has amazing props that are amazing on 0702 motors and has 23000kv motors"
If I buy an adapter for my xt60 Lipp that goes to xt30 to operate my small drone. Would that work or would something break?,"Like dropping it on the floor No. I have a lanyard on my radio Guys I need a little help. Which parameter of the battery would you sacrifice when choosing an alternative battery. The number of cells, the C rate, or the mAh more context needed. number of cells would require swapping your motors and or props too One of my drone uses 6S 65C 5000mAh battery and I'm trying to buy another one (just incase smth happens) but its out of stock. So I'm trying to find an alternative. But I'm most probably will never sacrifice changing the number of cells because well, I think it requires a 6S"
"You need to use the same number of cells as what you're using now, so stick with 6S. You can go up or down slightly in mAh and in C-rating and get similar performance. What exact battery are you using now?. It would work and nothing would break, but you need to be sure that the XT60 lipo is not too large for the quad you want to put it on. What lipo and what quadcopter?","I use a 6S 65C 5000mAh battery for this particular drone. I'm thinking of finding a battery that generates a similar amount of power than my current battery Ah yes, that drone that I definitely know because I can read your mind It’s a quadmula djin f25 with k3800 Motors and a S4 1300mah Lipo for mid Range That's a huge battery for an underpowered 2.5"". Again, electrically nothing will break, but I can't see you being able to fly far or long at *all*"
And which battery would be a good option ?,"Max like a 650mAh 4S or smth. Depending on the exact motor you might go up to 5S That's pushing it. But maybe with a small battery. Again, it depends on exactly which motor though Fine, the motor itself would probably handle 6S just fine, but you also have to consider the amp rating of your ESC"
That it manages the 1300mah or what exactly?:grinning_face_with_sweat:,"Oh, no, forget about using a 1300mAh battery on a 2.5"". Just forget you ever thought that was a good idea. The ESC and motors would *probably* handle 6S. But, like, 550mAh"
What post is this related to ?,"Well it is stupid. Get a new arms, it might cost you like 5-20€ in a worst case scenario Get a new arm, that one will self destruct at the first crash I don't do much freestyle, mostly cinematic. But yeah this is my backup drone, already ordered from AE.\ Just get a new arm, it will be so much better for everyone instead of using a Frankenstein quad This glue is crazy strong, this arm was broken before, I patched it before with epoxy. Yesterday it crashed from the motor side, not from where it was broken before :PepeTape: Just get a new arm, the glue can be as strong as you want it won't be as strong as a continuous piece of carbon fibers"
"Do you think I'll be able to run 6s on 1804 3500kv motors, I have a mamba reactor 66a esc and I'm using 3.5 inch props?","That is *very* high for 6S. Roughly akin to 2150 or 2200kv on a 6S 5"" Ah ok. Thought it might be worth a shot If you drop down to 5S it's a *lot* more tenable Sure I could try that"
Are these motors something you already own?,"Yeah. I got them for 4s Yea on 4S they'd be good for like a 4"" You could do 3500Kv 6S on a 3"" prop Ok. I'm using. 3.5.

I think it's holding the CMD button and then right click open or something Ive already used Betaflight on my mac yesterday. everything worked fine"
Are these 7 inch props? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/gemfan-7040-3-4pcs-5145.html,"I have connected a Foxeer T Rex to a SpeedyBee F405 V4 and want to disable the camera OSD remotely, but it doesn't work. I know about the joystick, but I don't have a way to plug it in Yes, they are some rather high pitched props too. Go into modes in betaflight, look for ""osd disable"" or something along those lines and set a switch to activate it"
Would this disable FC OSD or Foxeer OSD? I want to disable Foxeer OSD permanently,"It will just disable the osd from betaflight. To mess with the camera settings you need the joystick. Or a CC pad but not all fcs have one I have it and it's soldered on, but it still doesn't work"

anybody know why my flywoo explorer is only getting around 18 mins of flight from 4.2 to 2.8V on a Li ion pack? FLywoo said u can get like 25-30 mins?

ye 3000mah li ion. the one from flywoo. is it normal to have to be so high in the throttle at around 2.9-3.0 volts?. like i got to 2.8 and i was like damn i have no room to move the throttle p much. it felt a bit dangerous incase i had to dodge anything,"yeah, it uses really low kv motors on a really low pitch props, at 3.0 you should already be almost home if not already home"
"and im assuming if i up the pitch ill just get less flight time but slightly more power?. im using 3.5inch tri blades cuz the 4 inch bi blade was hitting my walksnail vtx. or wouldve hit, i replaced the props since i checked beforehand","maybe put  back on the 4"" bi blade and just mount the vtx differently. a lot of the magic sauce is the 4"" low pitch bi blade hmmm. i would need to either cut the screws or buy other shorter screws that's how my freestyle v2 vtx is mounted. vhb double sided tape is really strong the wires are kinda in the way to mount it tht low"
Is there any way to see if RID is turned on/off on my DJI Mini 4 Pro?,it's always on afaik. if there even is rid on it. iirc it's sub250g so it shouldn't have RID on it Sup guys whenever you have a second can someone tell me how do I identify a fc board.
"i think it says on the dji website that it is only active with the Intelligent flight battery (which makes it >250g), is there a way to check?","with your eyes. there is usually the name on it in silk screen. or you can send a picture of both sides and maybe someone knows the specific fc Thanks I was using my tongue yeah that's not the right organ @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) ^^ Don’t make that one on a date, could end in a restraining order. Your eyes are so beautiful   Spaniel licks them :face_with_tears_of_joy: it says on the website that it is sub250g so it shouldn't have any remote id chip  inside *Ah shit yeah I forgot, touch with the eyes, well, my bad, it happens* Can you pass the salt , uses eyes So it’s soldered on. But here is one side if we could have the other side too it would be nice, but also without the flash. (smells very vintage) Because I can’t read using my tongue where do I connect an elrs receiver. https://pyrodrone.com/products/cl-racing-f4s-flight-controller-pdb-osd-aio. I forgot the link. lol 5v goes to 5v, gnd to gnd, TX to RXn, and RX to TXn Is rx4 and tx4 the same they form uart 4, but they aren't the same thing. @caden it's so hard that if you have an spi fc you just need to go into betaflight>receiver tab (eventually select spi as the protocol)>bind phrase and type your bind phrase there. If it's one of the few serial Rx on a tinywhoop aio or if you use a discrete RX, then plug in a lipo for a few minutes, put a fan blowing on the fc, open up the wifi on your phone, wait, then ""expresslrsrx"" will appear, then type ""expresslrs"" as the password, enter your binding phrase, click save and voila"
"Hi! New here, and definitely new to the hobby too... I am planning to purchase my first controller and I have my eyes on Radiomaster Boxer.

Before that, I was planning to go for the TS16X but it was way expensive for me for a newbie. yeah, you're not getting much for $60 more, just a nice screen"
Esc on top and FC at the bottom - is this a recommended stacking? I'm thinking it will protect the FC board from dust a bit more. Anything I'm overlooking here?,"FC goes on top. and no, if anything it'll make the FC hard to access"

Hope that's a fair assumption generally on a 6s 5"" build you'll get 5~ minutes or more. i believe Oh okay. That'd be nice"
awh mann. you think it could carry like. 100?,:loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: i wouldnt try and cary anything on it tho
has anyone participated in mathworks minidrone? any tips for beginners?,"The battery hardly determines if you quad will fly like crap or not, but for freestyle on 6s you want 1100mah to 1500mah, and for lr you want want a 4s 21700pack or a 6s 18650 pack"
how do i change the refresh rate?. is it here somewhere?,"hey i am having a problem in betaflight 4.5.0 where in the osd it is saying cpu overload, but in betaflight it says the cpu is at 60% and I can't arm Reduce the pid-loop refresh rate. You want it to be at like 30%-40% okay i will give that a shot, thanks Over 50% load on the bench is a lot cause in flight it will get much higher oh okay. i see it now, thanks :). yea i changed it from 8 to 4khz and now cpu is 30%. thanks so much"
Anyone able to help me with this idk what is what the Red and Black is for battery but what is the Black and White cable for? And what is what the 3 pads?. I cant find manual and it did not Come with manual,"The black plug is to plug it on a wing fc on motor pads of the fc, the 3 other pads are the motor outputs, where you would normally solder on a motor. If you want to use it with a miniquad fc you will need a pdb White wire is signal and Black is ground Ye i wont be using it there :D. Uhm i am confused. There is no power output to the reciver The esc doesn't power the Rx directly Uhm that will be an issue them. I need somehow to connect all these things That's a dc motor, not a bldc motor"
Is there a way to connect it?,"With a modified esc firmware you could ask the esc to just send a steady DC voltage instead of a pulsed DC voltage on 2 of it's outputs, you could even make it run 2 DC motors actually, but even if you found a modified firmware of whatever this esc runs, changing an esc firmware can be a pain in the ass"
So uhm buy another or use a programable board?,"Watch Bardwell's video on flashing AM32 on a blheli_32 esc. Just change the motor. It will be way less of a hassle I cant its not for a drone :D You can use a brushless motor on anything you would use a brushed motor for. Plus with a brushless motor you don't have, well, brushes, so no need to swap the motor every 2 weeks cause the brushes wore down. You even have internally spinning brushless motors (like a dc motor where the outer metal casing isn't the bit that rotate) if you need to have the stator on the outside"
That is for that the brushed motor could work with the esc?,"Use your fingers Also, having the gps back there is really really dumb cause it points directly to the vtx antennas (not very smart) so it creates a ton of noise and it can't really talk to the sattelites, it's like you have your eyes wide open looking at the sun and try to count the numbers of stars in the sky at the same time You could put the gps on top of the camera for a significantly better reception, and you can remove the gps mount with the screw right next to it. Nope. AM32 is just an alternative solution to Blheli_32. Both are for brushless bldc motors"
What it does then even?,It is BLHELI_32 but slightly better. And will soon replace it since blheli_32 jumped from a bridge
I mean i want to connect brushed motor to brushless esc so what are my options only that filmware?,"I need help with finding the right ESC protocol for the AxisFlying Argus ECO F405 60A BLs stack I can’t find anything on the internet Thats how I bought it :face_with_tears_of_joy:  Fingers is what I used before but I cant get them as tight as I would like.  But thank you Yeah I know that's how they put it on, it's still stupid"
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) Is this tight enough? I feel like it need to be further because theres so much spare space but I cant really tighten it more,"Blheli_s, it says it in the product description, you can flash bluejay for better performance. Just hand tighten it, no need to go stupid tight Just make sure both are sma or rp-sma (that one has a pointy bit inside the connector and not the other side, doesn't matter which side has the pointy bit) just in case Also, consider swapping the props, in my experience most iflight props are crappy"
Oh do you also have a recommendation? It's the iflight afterburner but I think you already knew haha. Its for cinematic ofc,It said it’s already running Bluejay_QH30. And do I use DSHOT or MULTISHOT or etc. I would use DSHOT 600 This is the correct answer
https://youtu.be/_ZBvOTiCFUI?si=CCOJpcHSpnMu6iXX. What cable the guy connect to the motor?. Gnd and?,"it's a brushed dc motor. you just feed it dc current. and it spins. depending on the direction of current it spins the other way Yes but i am asking what wire did he connect to it because brushless esc has 3 wires but motor has 2 so asking what he connected to a motor The esc takes an input power gnd and signal, brushed motors only have power and gnd. They are driven by a scaled voltage output from the esc based on the input throttle signal. That's not a stock esc though this will depend on how the esc is configured, simply wiring it up like he did isn't magically going to work Yes that what i was asking gnd and power :). Okay now next issue i need to resolve how will i power the reciver I know am32 supports Brushed mode, idk about other esc firmware tho"
Idk anything about this if it wont work i ll order proper esc. What is better to power an reciver input power or output power from esc?. It will either work or it wont,that is true about anything. things are either wet or not wet
I've already woken everyone up while I'm debugging the drone. How can I temporarily disable any beeps (on startup)?,"where the red wire is, that's your battery positive Yes ik but you know what are pwm recivers. They need gnd signal and power. I have singnal and gnd. Black and White what voltage does the receiver take And i need also power to power it. Uhm let mé search it up. 4,8 - 6,0 then you'll need a 5v regulator to power it. as I assume your battery is higher voltage than that"
8.4 2s. Fully charged*. Rezistors?,"you can disable some of them in betaflight, specifically there's an option for it not to beep when usb is plugged in, but the boot up sounds from the esc/motors, I don't think you can disable. Do as much troubleshooting without a battery and use the lowest voltage battery possible. what no Issue is this is not a drone like a buck convertor. check who I was replying to... Oh sorry. :D. Why. Just 2 rezistors and voltage is lower that's an awfully inefficient way to do it, and your batter voltage changes as it discharges ... Ngl i am doing the same thing with the motor. Because if i put rezistors i can get to 5.7v and when battery is empty its 5v. So it will works. Heh. But just tell me where shoud i connect it input volatage or output battery voltage. stepped down with a proper regulator I heard that you said battery voltage wirh good rezistors :) https://tenor.com/view/face-palm-omg-omfg-wtf-disturbed-gif-7350269 I like when stuff goes boom"
https://www.quadkart.in/ethix-mr-steele-silk-v3-stout-1750kv-motor/  Any opinions about this brand? I am shortlisting these for my 6S 5 inch build.... Pressurized air?,I'd consider disassmbling a bit for the  cleaning
Isopropyl? And pressurized air?. Oh good call. Will try that,The ethix motors are all crappy. They are all dissapointing If you want to spend some money get some gts v4
How much is that worth in real money ?,"I am on a budget and this is my grieving build as I lost my 4S quad Get some emax 2207 or some XING2 ***2306*** (they fucked up the 2207) or the tbs grinder v4 if you want ultra high durability 19.8 in green bills. almosy 2k in INRs. For 20 real world dollars get the emax 2207 or the xing2. The xing2 will perform a little better Why you stressing that USD is real world dough! :slightly_smiling_face:  Ok got your point, I'll check out those. USD is just printed with nothing to back up the promise, isn't it. may be I'll get these https://robu.in/product/t-motors-2207-v2-1750-kv-brushless-motor/ Cause Australia doesn't exist and Canada is just part of the usa The velox line is *ok* but the xing2 and emax would be better. It's a joke about flat earthers and Americans"
are brushless escs supposed to give tiny voltages?,When I try to calibrate my sticks in velocidrone I get to the part where it asks for me to center my sticks and then it never detects it when I center my sticks. I am looking at the radios screen and I see that everything is leveled out stick wise and the sim still won’t detect it 1900kv. You won't be able to accurately read bldc with a multimeter
Why is that?. Its showing values 0.2 or 0.5 v. :skull:,Cause a multimeter is made to read continuous DC voltage
Oh okey. Brushless esc cannot be converted into brushed?,"Cause that's what a multimeter expect, but that's what it's getting. I told you it can, with a modified firmware"
Its very very hard ye i shoud rather buy proper one?,"Buy a bldc (brushless) motor No because my car doesnt support that Yeah it does. Cause your esc does I mean it would be other shape then i need to The fc just says ""spin faster"" or ""spin slower"" it doesn't care what is on the other side of the esc. You can get inner rotating brushless motors Hmmm Interesting idea. But i am not even sure what type of a motor i shoud get I told you you could like an hour ago. How is the motor mounted inside the frame No no i mean i am not sure what power motor i shoud get. DC motor type 130 Ye ye just wanted to give you a name of a motor"
"Power ratings are dumb, the kv is interesting. Did you design it yourself ?","Its on a internet but i can modify it Then you can just buy a brushless motor, may it be one with an inner or outer stator and modify it accordingly From official brand brushless motor 46 euro :skull: I mean, you can also get a brushed motor and swap it every 2 week. But you can get cheaper motors easily"
what is the best way to store a lipo battery?,"charge it to storage voltages and stash it, put it on storage charging from time to time 3.8V - 3.85V per cell is storage voltage btw"
You would want something like a 1222 brushless inrunner. They seem to be around 4500kv but kv for cars is “different” to drones. [A 605 inrunner should be a direct drop in replacement](<https://www.ebay.com/itm/305347716742?chn=ps&_trkparms=ispr%3D1&amdata=enc%3A190gXjp8uTgGjFodZvTPNYQ91&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&mkcid=2&mkscid=101&itemid=305347716742&targetid=2321110923741&device=m&mktype=pla&googleloc=9053071&poi=&campaignid=19894961968&mkgroupid=163588356363&rlsatarget=pla-2321110923741&abcId=9307911&merchantid=8021754&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD_QDh8NZjNaXZFDQKgyOUNxOuLAc&gclid=CjwKCAjwy8i0BhAkEiwAdFaeGOcXUS-Dxh18v856drA5C3q-Cf6857gyGIuD2ikOkrXsTiqREX0ZJRoCGU0QAvD_BwE>),"yeah that's 3d printed, you can literally just model a new motor mount"
So I made a drone that currently weighs 3 kg. I have three 6s lipo with 1.3amp current paired with 650kv 1245 prop. I have 3 prop plane configuration. For some reason my drone won't get off the ground. And at the most it flips over when all motors are on. What am I doing wrong?,Can we get a photo of this drone. And what size motors No not the KV the size. It’s normally a 4 digit number on the motor bell personally i dont have a lipo safe bag but i always wanted to get one. if you have one yes - its safer There is a motor on its tail bit I was doing a thrust test Well that’s definitely a unusual configuration Yea I guess but I wanted to make a vtol
650kv is quite low for a vtol. Do you have a tail rotor servo?,No. I want to just get it up in the air then I will add servos. Is it the amps should I get a 10amp battery Uh well your going to have a bad time without a tail rotor servo I have a motor on the back its just not mounted rn
Also are all your props on the correct way and motors spinning the correct direction?,One in the front is cw and the other is ccw Yeah that doesn’t really matter
Yeah. So you think there is enough thrust being produced?,Let’s just work though the easy things first. Once you can confirm the motors are all spinning the correct direction then we can move onto more complex things Each motor in the front is spinning opposite. One cw and other ccw. Cw has the cw prop. Ccw motor has ccw prop. Is that right Have you confirmed that they are spinning in that direction. Or are you just assuming Yeah I did before mounting. I made sure they were rotating opposite direction Ok so which one is cw and which is ccw. Using the orientation from the image you sent above Bottom one is cw. The top one on the wing is ccw Your tail prop is on upside down. It’s not gonna work like that Yeah I was doing a thrust test. On the scale. But its mounted clockwise
Any reason you picked a tricopter over a more conventional quad setup?,Its for school. They wanted to test different configurations I’m sorry my best guess is it’s too heavy but someone with a real answer should come along soon to help you
"Microfiber cloth just like any other lense. What solder are you using, what iron tip are you using, how much heat are you using, are you using flux?",400C. I’ve built with this before and same ESC. Never had this issue You need to pre-tin the - pad. that solder is also literally garbage and this would've easily worked if you had higher quality solder. you'll just have to wait till it's flowing and then tin the pad When I pre tin the solder doesn’t even stick at all to pad just keeps dripping off
Motor size. Did you want brushless or brushed?. Because that size of brushed motor can be had for like $5 on aliexpress,Ig i want rather brushless because i dont want to change it too often but if the brushed motor is really cheap i ll take that. If it was shorter in lenght it would be ideal The 1222 would melt the gear i assume because 11k kW. Wait i may slow it down ye Look up “180 87t brushed motor” on aliexpress
Same thing but more expensive?,"Okey lets see this one is 5euro. For me locally i can find normal one for 70 cents. If this was brushless and it would be reason able price i would take it. I need motor that is fast but not as fast it will melt the gears or it cant be even drivable Ah, (probably) di pole brushed motors, my favorite"
yo can someone help me bind my mob7 to my zorro? zorro is for sure on elrs v3.x since i have two other drones also on elrs v3. im a bit confused since on the mob it's an SPI reciver and the elrs version is tied to the bf version,"(by dipole I mean it only has 2 magnets, I'm not sure if it's the correct term) I am not a expert at this i just need good motor for race Just update the fc to a newer version of BF (don't forget the back up) so you are sure it's on 3.xx, then go in the receiver tab then type in your bind phrase. Well then you don't want a tiny low torque brushed motor"
Do you think 50k rpm is way too much for a car?,"Bf 4.4.3 will work fine. Depends on what the gear box is designed for. Some are made to turn super high rpm low torque into lower rpm higher torque, others do the opposite Small gear and then bigger gear that is it"
Do you know the gear reduction?,"Uhm :D i can maybe count it if it helps Well that will take a while But it will take longer cuz idk how to do it ok so i attempted to bind, put the quad in binding mode and the red light was blinking fast and then i put the zorro into binding mode and they connect for a sec and the drone in the preivew in the reciver tab moves quickly and then stops moving"
There is only those two gears ?,Then it expects high rpm low torque and makes it into low rpm high torque. Which isn't super helpful without the actual gear ratio Dont worry i ll count it
"What size is the model ?  (1:16-1:10-etc, not the size in mm)","Also I will need to go find what is a good wheel rpm, I kinda forgot, been a while since I messed with rc cars Idk i seen joshua bardwell having the radiomaster t12 and ye"
Can I have the link to the printables post ? It probably says somewhere on what rpm/kv it expects,"It does not and it does not have even a guide how to assemble :skull:. https://www.printables.com/model/165280-fully-printed-128-rc-car-chassis-mini-z-compatible/files. Idk i was thinking about mounting there a drone motor :grinning_face_with_big_eyes: Ok yeah sorry that's a bit out of my comfort zone, I don't really want to misslead you I think i know less than you :D Since 130 brushed motor kv does vary quite a bit, like, my recommendation would be to use something like an 1103 2500kv motor but, well, didn't mess with rc cars since a while. Select SPI Also you can't do the wifi bind with spi Rx, which you probably kinda tried to do before I did I just had it pressed for the pic A motor is a motor, it can be used in anything So how do I bind them Send another screen of your receiver tab now I’m trying to do a binding phrase True i mean. Where you know what series motors Btw i didnt find anything on the 1200 and 1100 I can send a picture of my screen of the binding phrase I didnt find anything for 1200 brushless innerrunner Well now your binding phrase is 12345678, now turn on your radio, go to expresslrs, wifi, open up the wifi on your phone, connect to ""expresslrsrx"", password is ""expresslrs"" and enter your bind phrase ""12345678"" I just kinda made those up and hoped they existed That's some great advice. ""get some 6.322.3 motors, hopefully that's a thing"" Look around for 1/28th scale brushless motors Does it matter that I just posted a pic of my binding phrase Yes now martian will hack your computer I got an real Size truck motor costing 20k Might be slightly too heavy You replied to yourself Oh well. Well 1200 is a inrunner size Enter my bind phrase where And I assumed 1100 would be too I just told you what to do"
I connected it but put my bind phrase into beat flight?. Beta*,This is the bind phrase on your fc. Now connect your radio via wifi and enter the same thing as you put there
What is a senzor on a motor?,"And then just hit save and reboot or bind receiver It's a thing that tells you things. Save Yeah I know. But it's probably an rpm sensor A sensored motor just allows it to know exactly where it is in the rotation giving it full power at low rpm and also removes the stutter that some can have at low rpm I'm sure some motors have a heat sensor and no rpm sensor I don’t know if they have sensored motors in the size you want. Or sensored escs That's kinda useless in a tini rc car Just found this amazing item on AliExpress.

I mean its expensive Now you read what I sent you earlier  @caden. That should work I did it’s connected to my phone In ~5000-6000 kv if you go 1s. Well now you enter your bind phrase. Then click save https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/382919027167 or this Will probably work too What do you think is better I would use the second one. Cause it has the flat side so it's easier to mount securely, and it's cheaper. Reboot. And that's it. They are now bound for life How can I check and make sure Power on the radio then the quad and check for yourself There should be some bars next to the voltage. Also, always keep a fan blowing on the quad when powered on on the bench. And that's a mob6 elrs, not a mob7 Ik what makes u say that Those are the red motors and blue frame of the mob6 elrs red light goes solid for a sec and then goes back to slow blinking Wait a minute I thought you two were the same person Yeah well that explains for the mob7. And the zorro that becomes a pocket lol no wonder why you were confused You can't bind an spi Rx like that, you have to do the same thing as what Caden did. Well, you probably can (with the 3 plug unplug) but a bind phrase is a lot easier Hey would one of you guys mind guiding me through it if I screen shared.. If not I get it ive been sortve following along, i have a binding phrase all set up, i just cant get them connected"
You did the wifi on the zorro too ?,"I can add whoever is willing and screen share yeah, zorro is all set up. ive been flying my mob6 2024  just fine with it (not to mention everything wrong with the mob6 2024)"
"Ok, and the bind phrase is also set up in betaflight receiver tab and you selected spi ?",hey this is me on my pc account can i screen share to you @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) because its not working
Should i get the BetaFPV Aquilla16 instead of my set?,no. you've asked a thousand times. the aquilla is hot garbage compared to your set I was just asking bc its cheaper. Sorry

Tho I wouldn't do lr with it I might bring it as an extra drone just for like fun shots. wanted to know how much time I will be able to get on a li ion pack Tho keep in mind you really want the molicell cells inside or the li-ion won't be very happy I can’t run it underneath unless I de solder all of the motor wires and  I don’t plan on doing that. BLITZ F7 V1.2 You just unplug one side and run it underneath. That's how I did on a moonlight build I did a little while back
"I’ve tried pulling on the wire I can’t seem to unplug it, is it just in there SUPER GOOD?","You push one and under the esc and pull it with tweezers until it pops out the other end. Eh, you don't pull on the wire. You unplug the mipi connector So open up the camera and unplug the connector at the back. Just remove the metal backing. And that's a mipi connector. Don't pull on the cable, just unplug the connector"

On 4 in 1 there isnt a option or?,there probably is. just have to flash the multi module in there Oh okey. Do you think its better to buy firstly 4in 1 or buy elrs and later module 4in1 but elrs will be stronger if you don't care about the space a module takes up. buy it with 4in1
Wdym locked out?. Both run on 100mW so shoud be so different,"~~very worth buying new receivers if you want reliable flight~~. wait mt12. not flight then. nvm. On 4in1 it's literally just a switch in the menu.  If you buy it in LBT, it will be locked out, but if you flash it to the normal firmware, you will be able to pick FCC/LBT wherever applicable with just a menu option."
So there seems to be a bit of controversy over  Is it okay to catch a DJI drone landing and flip it over to turn it off?,Shoudnt be so different * 4in1 with LBT firmware prevents usage of non-LBT modes 4in1 with FCC fimware allows usage of LBT and non-LBT modes
Example for non lbt mode?,"D8, D16. D16 exists in LBT variant Okay idk what is that but i want to use it fully FRSKY receiver protocols. anyway, it's just firmware. this is so incredibly wrong that it's kinda sad that people still think that"
But i shoud get it in lbt ye?,"ELRS, at 100mW, has an order of magnitude more range than FRSKY D16 at 100mW. while also being faster"
? I am not a expert at these things sorry then. If it Works i am fine with it,ELRS uses a much newer and more efficient method of radio transmission than those old systems. so you get a lot more range for the same amount of power I am getting 4 in 1 because elrs for racing and other for testing
But i shoud get the lbt?,"If you're importing from outside of the EU into EU, yes. so that it doesn't get stuck in customs. then flash it to a non-EU-locked firmware"
Okey thanks very much. Btw if i would have put on the 4 in 1 a elrs module would be stronger? The elrs,"you'll have to elaborate on that, I don't udnerstand"
I mean putting on 4 in 1 Mt12 a elrs module would it make stronger the signal?,"your sentence form weirds me out, now I get it xD. Putting an ELRS module on a 4in1 MT12 will, alone, do nothing.. An ELRS module talks to ELRS receivers. Oh is there a way how to make the signal stronger i mean only elrs FCc Mt12 has 250 mW. But i ll have only 100mW *I mean you can flash non-EU firmware and get all 250mW*. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. And there are external ELRS modules that go up to like 2000mW But that is only with only elrs Mt12 i am getting 4 in 1. Oh okey 4in1 is mostly 100mW. ELRS, in LBT firmware, is also locked to 100mW. but ELRS modules in general can go up to 2W some are 500mW, some are 1W, etc. also there are two kinds of ELRS currently on the market - 2.4GHz (like 4in1) and 900Mhz (like Crossfire) Okey thank for all your help"
What is the best way to protect a gopro? I've heard nothing but angry people smashing gopros with fpv.,lens protector (just use an nd filter though) and a tpu mount that wraps all the way around
"It's, fine, the purple labelled gnb aren't really made for performance iirc, but more to just be light, get the flower ones, or a cnhl ministar. Also, what quad is this for ?","really depends on what youre using it for For my djin F25 wanna to try something out That is ***way*** too big. The quadmula f25 is a 2.5"", you want like 550mah 4s, if not even a little smaller. And if you want a bigger pack to do some very light LR (very light cause, well, there is a reason why we don't use 2.5"" schoolbus frames for lr), go with a small li-ion pack. Like a 4s 18350 pack. Or 18650 I'm pretty sure neither the battery nor the quad will be happy tho. It's very possible it won't even be able to take off with a 4s 18650 pack. I went to check the weight of the 1100mah pack, it should be able to fly with it well enough actually, and it will be much easier than doing an 18350 4s pack or an 18650 3s pack that might not have enough volts at the end of the pack to stay in the air. Tho it will not work for freestyle if you were hopping to do both on the same pack, with a like p/w ratio of 3.5 it won't freestyle"

Even tho it says, that the zones are not applibacle for UAS Why would they write it in then I heard on youtube that it shouldnt have those spikes @le_mitrailleur64 @Noah FWIW, interpretation of restrictions should follow the most specific first, and up to the most broad. In this case, that means follow the actual written wording in the restriction, rather than assuming the more broad exemption applies"
So that's mean that I am not allowed to fly ?,"You have a notch right on that spike. Instead of looking at **GYRO [SCALED]**, look at the matching **GYRO** field to see how the filter is being applied. That is how I'm reading it ok thank you very much for the help oh so only GYRO and not GYRO_SCALED wouldnt fuck with them lol. i just say saw that I hope that they will delete this because the internatioanl commit is done **GYRO_SCALED** is what you look at to find where noise is--it's the gyro reading *before* filters are applied. **GYRO** is post-filters, that's the information that the PID loop is seeing. Both are useful to look at actually I flew yesterday:Harold:. on mobile phone we don't see the message that is a restrected area it was my first fly with my new drone You could also try asking local police or something like that. Maybe they know more about that zone @DædalusFPV okay now this seems to look right yes, and I saw many little planes flying 300 meters from the ground"
so no need to do anything?,hm. try to find the pilots next time :P. and ask them. But only because other Pilots break rules doesnt mean you should break them too. Just saying
"RC planes, or actual planes?",i thougt you meant rc planes Actual planes are still allowed to fly with a filed flight plan and radio contact with ATC ah. well then probably dont try to find the pilots. could be a bit hard getting up there
"I just learned about these goggles, do you know if there is any real difference between them and the recon hd ?  Or if it's just them essentially re releasing it to not support fatshark anymore","it doesn't have video out, it has a larger screen, and it takes 3-6s instead of 2-5s I don't know what VRX is in the Recons, but the WS Goggles L sure look like they might also have a replaceable VRX board. The side panel may also be a future Analog VRX receiver bay. It annoys the *shit* out of me that they built the antennas into it again I really hope you're right about the analog vrx... that's probably the biggest issue I see with these goggles Well, you can probably add some smas with a touch of tinkering. Like people did on all the goggles with integrated antennas so far you shouldn't need to in the first place, they're beginner goggles I didn't say the opposite"
Sorry. What I want to know is other than the cheaper entry price point what is the actually difference. From my view it just appears to be a lower end set of goggles aimed at beginners. I would not really call it a new generation of goggles but rather a new series of goggles offering less feature for lower price. I don't see any gain over the original goggles X. In fact the built in antennas make it worse?. Is my evaluation correct?. If I wanted to buy into ws the  goggles X is still the best choice?,"Best choice for performance yes. But not everyone has the money to drop £500 on some goggles. With these new ones you could potentially have a walksnail whoop setup for around £500  And a 5” for £600-700 with charger, goggles radio etc"
"RCPROPLUS DC6  i need this plug, they are expensive, and hard to get in the EU. its the exact same thing used on surron light bee bateries.  any one know where to get em as cheap as posible? cheapest i can find it with 2 day shipping is 150PLN or abt 35 euro",dude. dude. omg. oh my fucking god. the goggles l might be my chance to get digital finally. what are ur guys thoughts on it so far. any bad negatives. realistically i could get those instead of cobra x v2s. hypothetically if i were to get walksnail whats the lowest latency mode. and what vtx would give me that
"Aren't those batteries delivering a huge amount of power? Why would you want to cheap out on the connector, when cheaping out means it's very likely to melt or burn?","Only like 6000w peak not a lot. And at 60v a that so rly low amps 60V 100A. mate. That's a lot of amps. Anyway, those are like $35-$40 for a set even in the US Pricey compared to xt90 that can do that power ez The XT90 is only rated for 90A spike current, not sustained. And before you say it's rated up to 500V so it can take 6000W, that's not how connector ratings work Yeah and surrons do 6kw peak momentarily and sit nominal 3000w I mean, go ahead and change the connector on your batteries then if you're so confident in it Plus xt are overated always. Can’t change connectors sadly. I need to find these rc plugs as cheap as posible and then imma make a connector adapter cable to xt90"
These batteries are bonkers expensive--why are you fussing over a few euro?,somewhere around 20 ms if you're lucky but normally around 35-40 depending on where you fly on what framerate/res the lowest one which iirc is 540p does the best latency. I think it's technically 540p 100 fps but the screen on the box goggles doesn't support more than 60
"You do know you're not in an e-bike server, right?","well duhhh, thats why i came here asking abt RC connectors Ok, I just wanted to make sure because 445 euro is ridiculously expensive compared to the batteries that we typically deal with here You shouldn't be using rc connectors on an ebike battery. They're not rated for the loads of an ebike battery"
rly? so how much would you guys pay for a 2300wh batery?. it comes stock on the electric dirtbikes called surrons,"Again, most of us wouldn't because this is a drone discord im curoius if hes talking about its cheaper per wh for drone specific stuff, or if its cheaper cause you are buying tiny bateries, that are actualy way more expensive, if you bought enough of em to 1:1 with letsay a surron batery. any way doesnt matter. im just here for these pesky rc connectors. id just rip open the batery and solder on xt90 plugs, but dont wanna mod the batery, so i need those rc plugs for cheap or some that are simular enough to fit, so i can make an adapter harnas to xt90"
how many amps are gonna be flowing through there again?,"Looking at CNHL and the biggest battery they sell, it’s about $1.5/watt-hour irrelevant rly, for my use case peak 1400w so i can go cheapo mode on this how is that irrelevant they're just their new budget goggles am i tripping or are there legit no omni antennas on them Honestly the DC6 just looks like barrel plugs in a fancy housing @Naz. That Guy cause it wont be full power ever. thats what i was thinking Just measure them and get some barrel plugs then"
any idea on housing part? cant 3d print that cause heat. cant use metal cause conductive. cant use hot glue and heat wrap jackets cause well heat,connector shouldnt heat up enough to melt plastic. otherwise you ARE pulling too many amps The walksnail vrx can't use effectively both an omni and a directional antenna at the same time 3d printing plastic melts the moment your room is too hot dude what are you printing my guy
"Why bother with 3d printed housings? If you find a barrel jack that works/fits, just heatshrink any exposed metal so it doesn't short","pla like going melty dont u know At 70°c yeah. Especially a black part in the sun PLA is amateur to use for anything functional 70c is FAST melting, you think it gets 70c in norway, the land of ice and snow xD It doesn't just melt if your room gets above 25°c. Did you ever hear about a concept called ""dark stuff gets hot when exposed to the sun light"" PLA doesn't need to get to 70C to be problematic, the glass transition temp is as low as 50C, and that's absorbed, not ambient Plus it indoors, and last time I checked, indoors isn't at -50c with polar bears and ice like the outside of norway It's still not just *oh my room is hot so now my pla spool just melted* so the barrels dont touch read the second half of the sentence Put a heatshrink on each individual barrel then put a bigger heatshrink over the whole thing. Not that hard yes but when you unplug it they both goes loose and dangle then.. make a connector out of anything but pla Or two giant bullet plugs. And just let them dangle"
is xt120 compatible with RCPROPLUS DC6? doubt it,"You can just change it on both ends then get your RCPROPLUS DC6 and stop complaining Or do that. Like, most connectors aren't made to just work with any other connector, most of them just work with themselves and that's all expensive AF then 1 plug costs as much as 2 weeks food in my country then.. get a bullet connector that may or may not fit and either print a housing or use heat shrink. theres no other sollutions for your problem. unless you want to solder a new connector on both sides. then go with XT120"
ER3C-I or shoud i buy ER5C-I for RC i am not sure because 3c has build in antenna is that good or?,external antenna is better usually but it really depends on your use. and one has 3 channels while the other has 5. id go with the er5c. the er5c-i is also internal antenna. its what the -I means guess imma try matching bullet connectors and do heat shrink wrap + sculpt housing/holder from something non conductive and heat shrink around that thats the regular ER5C. you said ER5C-I Oh let me doble check what are you gonna use it for how big is the car. and how far do you wanna go I ll use it in multiple i ll be using it with the car i am driving. From 1:28 up to large I am now confused its actually not er5c but r85c whats the smallest one youre gonna use I dont see much difference. 1:28
wait actually. the goggles l have no omni?,apperantly this. one isnt elrs i mean id realistically rather only have directional Dont mind it mind the reciver and tell me what is better please cuz when you fly at a spot you are looking at the spot from outside. ykwim def the elrs reciever But choose whitch one. First or second the R85C is frsky. how many channels do you need for your cars. like throttle and steering for sure but what else if you dont need anything else get the er3c if you need more.. still dont get the R85C I have drone reciver wirh 9 channels
I need a help shoud i rather get elrs Mt12 with a module 4in 1 (stronger mW) or shoud i rather get weaker 4in1?. 4in1 is 100mW and elrs FCC is 250mW,"I mean that would cost a lot more How much meter do you think with 250mW and 100mW no clue. youll get alot more with elrs. youd get more if elrs was at 25mw What are even mW. :skull: milli watts. its the power. the transmitter is transmitting at. more power = more range. more power = more penetration So 250 would get more Range yep. not just cause its 250. ELRS in general will get more range. 4in1 doesnt have ELRS 4in1 has frsky and a bunch of other outdated stuff :face_with_diagonal_mouth: If you want to know why we don't use 4 in 1 modules anymore, it's cause, well, with frsky, flysky, spec etc, the range is about 32.8 inches away at 1w of power, and going behind a single obstacle means you get a failsafe"
But for RC car is okay. ?,No. Elrs is the only protocol you should use
Flysky and frsky is reealy bad. You already have a boxer right ?,90% of RC cars have everything else than elrs. Yeah i mean Then rip off the frsky or spec Rx and put in an elrs one. Then it is already exactly as good as the ranger Tx If its not my car and i want to drive it i dotn think my friend will be too happy
no?. you can buy your own receivers,"Well, all you need to do is to (after slapping them on the cheek for still using spec) steal their radio while you drive their car. You need to have the same bind phrase on both end anyway. It's not like with analog and stuff where you can just hop on anyone's channel and start to use it I ll just bind it thru reciver Just use elrs and use their radio when using their car, it will be way way easier than having to bind *everytime*. The range on the old 2.4ghz link is really terrible. Even for a car it's awful Realisticly tell me how far do you think can get the 4in1. What you think. I just want to know about 4in 1 but you are still saying elrs :PepeNoo: I mean like clear no obstacles far enough that you wont see it anymore Then 4in 1 is pretty fairrly good how much cheaper is ti No no i mean i ll be getting the elrs one for sure"
On the er3c-1 i can get there external also i mean connect there?,not as good as external thats for sure
"What sort of cursed battery is this?. The more expensive charger has requires the XT60 be plugged in because that is how it pushes power into the battery. The cheap charger somehow does require this, which is a terrible idea because the balance wires are so much smaller",I need to buy a new battery I guess lol No you just need to make an adapter
probably zero?. no reason to replace them,they have been on a launch spree starting with their gimbals to the 2W VTX and now a budget goggle. What are the chances the goggles X will get replaced. so you still stand by the idea that the next big thing for the goggles X is a new VRX module over a enirely new goggle yeah I mean. they already just gave out a fix board for free
would it be possible too put this one on the crux35 https://caddxfpv.com/collections/single-antenna-version-kit-2024/products/walksnail-avatar-hd-kit-v2?variant=44596343996718,yes but probably better to put the 1s vtx on there i want too but how bc they only suport up too 3s and my batterys are 4s your FC will have voltage regulators on it. see if it can handle the power draw. (it should be able to)
so instead of coneccting it too my battery or smt i should connect it too a +5v thing on my drone and then i should be good?,"Well, they mounted the 1w vtx in the hdzero bnf, so I'm pretty sure you can easily mount a ""normal"" walksnail vtx inside i rather go with the smaller one personaly Doesn't the 1s have worse range compared to the full version. Can you buy it. And what does it do yes but i don't need too fly 500 meters away i just want too freestyle at my park Yeah but penetration is a thing too. Range is not an issue in any of our systems, penetration can be @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) so i should connect it too one of the red marked points not yet, but if you own goggles x you just email them proof of purchase and you get them well i don't think 2 trees will break up my video yes, but the full-size is kind of too heavy for the crux35. yes. if they can provide enough power It won't break the video,  but it will introduce breakup what do you mean by that if i may ask. well i get it but i am just tipping my toes into the digital world and i just want too try and upgrade my crux first before i buy a expensive drone and then find out i don't like it you need to see the current the 5v regs on the aio can provide. to see if they can power the 1s vtx how do i find that out you look at the specs of the aio You will still need an expensive goggles or vrx, but also, you can use either to upgrade your crux35, it won't really care that much for a few extra grams i am going too buy those 200 bucks goggles L so i don't find that too expensive for a pair of goggles What benefits does it bring i will but where do i find how much current the 1s walksnail thing needs Oh, yeah, forgot about those, but they are very new, I would wait to see what real people have to say about them on the specsheet of the 1s walksnail vtx Would you consider making it naked for the higher power output but lower weight no, I don't think I'd need more power on a toothpick 3.5"" You shouldn't really run any vtx naked, it's just asking for a disaster i will bc i am still saving up for new goggles and stuff but otherwise i would have stayed analog but now i kinda want too upgraid more bc its cheaper The crux35 isn't *that* light, it won't really care for an extra 10g"
Oh its not the new diversity board just new sensors. Even for penetration. For heat damage? Does it not regulate output internally,"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) so first picture is from the 1s walksnail stuff and the second picture is from the datasheet but i just want too dubble check will it work and is that enough amps (or am i dumb and looking at the complete oposide thing Yup, but it doesn't mean it will like frying itself alive if it tries to push more than 300mw probably just wanna go with the v2 pro okey then but do you mean the v2 or pto. pro Hey can I talk to someone in the voice chat thing to help me bind my elrs mob 6 and my rm pocket elrs I thought I made a binding phase but maybe not I just have been having trouble, I can’t call right now but soon You will just have to connect it to vcc i don't want too sounds dumb but could you tell me the differences. ^^ The only difference is the camera The pro looks better, and has much better night vision"
what?. v2 is the vtx. pro is the camera...,"yea sorry i am kinda retarded If you can't afford 10g more (1s is ≈ 10g, full sized is ≈ 20g) (so most micros, that is most things 3"" or smaller) then go with the 1s, other wise the regular 20x20 vtx is better. Well, you also have an hd v2 camera, so his question is understandable no. v2 has nothing to do eith it. v2 is *just* the vtx There is an HD v2 camera I get what you mean, I'm just saying that what you said could lead to a confusion, which lead to his question @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) why is my stuff not binding I need help :crying_face::pleading_face:"
Are you absolutely sure both sides uses elrs ? And if you did do the ELRS bind correctly - which you can find pretty easily on the ELRS website - the only other issue I can see is flawed hardware,first i made a binding phrase then i went into beta flight with my mob 6 connected and input my binding phrase and pressed save and reboot then i connected my pocket to my phone and  put in my phrase then pressed save and it said upload success reboot to effect then i pressed reboot now what which mob6 is it. 2024 or no can you open the lua script on your radio and show it hold the SYS button and it opens menu. go to TOOLS. somewhere in there there's ELRSv3.lua show a picture. that's not an image. anyways. change the packet rate from f500. to 250hz. and then just hold return to exit out. and then it should all work done thanks if i doesnt work i will l et you know
It said telemetry recovers does that mean it worked?. How do I know if there connected,yeah that does mean it's connected you can go into betaflight on the tinywhoop and see stuff on the receiver tab move I got signal and everything but when I try to take off it just skims the ground and then disarms
can you use the goggles v2 with something like the mini 3 pro?,"on the receiver tab. is your throttle actually the throttle This is a funny suggestion to me. I am looking to shift to walksnail very soon but as someone who has flown a 40g O3 on 2"" I really find it hard to believe that 20g is considered ""heavy"" for a build of that size. WTH is happening. I arm it and it goes crazy. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what do i do. It’s not In acro I don’t think when I arm it and tilt it forward it throttles to tilt it back https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146"
"Replacing it with what, exactly? And on which charger?","on the toolkitrc M something one sec il get the model name. M6D just need to have a pd board on the other end negotiating for 20v@100W or whatever you were intending, and then input that to the charger"

I am kinda confused. can you link or send a photo of what it is?,"just search. usb power delivery breakout board. or something. USB PD is just a spec Hey guys I bought a mobula 6 elrs ( not 2024) and binded it to my radiomaster pocket and when I try to take off it just skims the ground, I don’t think it’s in acro mode because when I arm it and then tilt it it tries to re level itself, but I can’t take off it just goes crazy, what do I do yes that's an example. <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806399278202.html>. this one is sus af. but it's also one. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1262563991482531850. daedalus already linked you something OK but like. https://tenor.com/view/brooklyn-nine-nine-terry-jeffords-why-b99-brooklyn99-gif-21715381 why the case or :thinkies:"
"I want to save weight on my upcoming trip :). bringing a good 100w charging brick instead of the PSU is a lot more useful. (also general question, can I use the other plugs while using that charger to power my M6D?)","depends on how goofy your power brick is. I know my ugreen can do it Its the UGREEN 100watt. dis thing yeah I have that one. the US version. ... plugged into my EU wall lol. I have another 65 watt power brick with replaceable plugs. its super cool I don't know about that one though, I have the bigger one too which I confirmed yeah there's a chonkier fancier one. I'd check but it's across the ocean I know but I think it’s in the wrong flight mode and I don’t know what to do no. this is all bought like. 2 years ago. <https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-200W-Desktop-Charger/dp/B09MGRNYHH/>. might be this one what mode do you want"
Anyone travelled with a drone ? Going on holiday a couple weeks to turkey but don’t want the hassle if there is any. Any information would be great. DJI mini 4 pro to be specific,"if you look at the pictures it pretty much explains what it can do on each port cool 3 active plugs in ""full"" use I don’t even see an acro mode in the options"
Are you really a flat earther?,"When you get to smaller than 3"", you are concerned with weight over anything else, so if you can save 10g, you do it, and a 20g vtx is really heavy at this size, it's a weight difference you absolutely will feel in flight. That's why a lot of people on toothpick style quads still prefer analog just because of how much lighter it is. The question if you want a nicely flying micro usually isn't ""is it light enough to not be an issue"" but ""can it be lighter"". (Even if there are some exceptions depending on the size, such as on 75mm using a fractal75 frame, cause it's heavier, but it flies a lot better than most plastic frames)"
"Hi, one of my drone motors dosnt spin after crash and I hear esc restarting sound after arming. Does this mean the motor is broken?",https://tenor.com/view/same-car-crash-subwe-funny-gif-20193794
and so you believe that losing output power is a worthwhile trade to make for better flight performance? This maybe a difficult question to answer but does the 1s have enough penetration to not be noticeable?,"Well, you fly smaller quads in smaller places, you won't fly a whoop as far as you would fly a 5"", granted it's two very different quads but you get the idea, you don't need as much penetration on a micro as you need on a miniquad, so in the case of a micro I would say that loosing some range isn't that big of an issue, plus on the WS vtx it still has respectable range even on the 1s board"
the field where I fly has a nice forest where I like to tree surf with my micros. Analogue is terrible. You think ws would handle all the branches?,"most likely, there will be some breakup and smearing quite obviously, but it will handle it much better than analog would And compared to the O3. I know it's a different class but still. To get an idea Forests are one of the few areas where a ton of VTX output power *actually* 100% helps with video reception. Walksnail will probably look better than analog because... well, it just does, that's how it works. But you're definitely still going to see video quality issues Ye I agree I find that even my O3 sometimes struggles with branches even in close vicinity."
"Hey i know this is a stupid question, but where do i put the elrs? I used to have my elrs receiver on the side of my drone until i had my first crash and messed it up, im trying to move it somewhere else, but where would be most effective?",first of all; put heat shrink around it I do not have any. Unfortunately
did it not come with any?,"Nope, and i dont have a heat gun Ive just resorted to zip ties:grinning_face_with_sweat:"
electrical tape atleast?,just isolate it any way you can. tape or anything
Wait the wires on the elrs chip?,whats with the plastic sheet above your stack. the entire board including the pads Ohh i had some problems with the battery strap. Ahh ok and then just put it somewhere where it wont get hit by props. doesnt really matter where I was thinking of putting it ontop of the plastic board ontop of your vtx or behind your camera
But where would the receiver poke out?,"in the plastic mount at the bacb below the camera. usually. or behind it, I guess between the stack and cam Im going to move it there thanks ..after you put electrical tape around it Also is there any way to stop the battery strap from hitting the motor wires without this stupid plastic board. Ill go get some now what. the battery straps shouldnt be anywhere near your motor Do i need 2 battery straps then Because i just put 1 strap across the middle you certainly want 2 but thats not the question get a photo of how you mount the battery please"
1 sec. Abit like that. Waiiit. It isnt meant to go around the whole drone… is it?,"no..... atleast you arent using a belt i guess Only under the top plate, also I'm not sure if it's perspective or something but that's a chonky lipo Yea. It is quite hefty get a good quality shorter strap No no these straps are fine i have shorter ones Yeah it kinda looks like their 1850mah pack, which is extremely big The elrs wires look abit too long. I think ima put the elrs ontop of the vtx after you put electrical tape around it Keep forgetting. I got it here Well their 1350 pack is chonky please get a proper prop nut for your front right motor Wait wait but what if the wires get damaged and i have to get the tape off. Should i secure the elrs chip down with blu tack then you take the tape off. uh double sided tape. probably"
Why does it need a new nut? Looks cool. Steam punk look :p,that prop will never be tight The stupid plastic board stops your velcro from pulling the wires. Its ingenious design. And rip out the delicate wires... not a great idea what are you talking about. if electrical tape can rip the wires off his soldering joints he should really rethink his soldering skills Hey hey my soldering skills are good theyre.. acceptable. your motor wire joints should prob be reflowed a little hotter. your main power leads aswell. entire pad should be covered in solder. but itll work fine Because its delicate soldering. You don't want to keep taking tape off to examine it. why would you need to examine it After crashes like this ive had heat shrink around mine for a year now and never ever had to examine it. and i fly in bandos indeed. dont worry itll be fine. tape wont break it
why no heat shrink on the rx?,"doesnt have any. electrical tape is fine tho ye. better than nothing Is it true that turtle mode doesn’t work on bi bladed props nope. unless you dont have enough thrust. itll be more difficult but it should be fine @DDogUK Its more dangerous not putting anything around the RX instead of just not being able to see the wires to ""check"" them. (wich you dont need to do anyways). And heat shrink is not that expensive. Just get some clear heatshrink for like 5$ Except its crashed twice and had to do that each time. The wiring isn't going to come unconnected whilst flying then sorry to tell you but your soldering might be lacking. ive never had that happen So, it probably is considering its his first ever build or your reciever is in a bad spot Soldering shouldnt just fall apart at a crash. There is one scenario where solder should give up and that is when the wire is being pulled. (like motor wires in a crash where an arm breaks)"
"Yo i got a question, is there anything wrong with my elrs?. The bars arent going up","It hasn't but he still needs to check it, if they issue is the receiver ELRS is your control link. for your radio transmitter Which is what you want to cover in tape... No they mean the wires. I think What. This is your ELRS Receiver (short RX). It is receiving the signals sent by your Radio Transmitter.   You should put heatshrink or electrical tape around it - because its not good to keep it exposed It was covered up before"
And why is it not anymore?,Wait wrong photi. Photo Well it had padding around it. To be fair it would be tighter with tape. It was also on the side of the drone- which is why it isn’t working. Because of blunt force. Might not of cut the solders. But the crash might of messed something up inside Cosmetics isn't the issue. Troubleshooting it is.   Grass crash isn't blunt... wall is...
What is your problem now? What do you need help with,The drone wont connect to the goggles what channel is the VTX on how do you know. im asking milo lol Because that is what its set to where do you see that On the front of the goggles no i meant what is the channel of the VTX. you set that in betaflight Ohh idk gotta ask ddoguk bout that he does all that stuff ok so hes helping with betaflight Yea i do the building he does the programming
ah. Okay. Are you able to check the VTX channel in Betaflight now? @milo @DDogUK,Okay. 1. Open Betaflight 2. Connect FC via USB to the PC 3. Wait until it connects  4. Go into Video Transmitter Tab on the left side 5. Make screenshot of screen 6. Send the screenshot into here. @milo I might need to charge the pack first you dont need a battery plugged in for this Just do the steps. You dont need to do anything extra @milo Ddoguk doesnt want to do it for some reason
Well then we cant help you?,"I said explain why you would check why the software. Its not going to randomly change mid flight. well you guys are saying you arent getting video Its called troubleshooting. You never know. How can we be sure, that the VTX is actually on Race 8 and not on Race idk what. Or any other VTX Settings. So would you please send us what we asked for, or we cant help you. I set it to racing, troubleshooting includes testing things that have changed. It didn't fly into house connect to a USB and do a software upgrade. Either you send us the screenshot of the Tab - or we cant help you.. You dont need to discuss this. We want to help you, because we have fun helping others.. But with this attidude of you i dont really want to help anymore Ok thanks for your suggestions. I'll check later. Its not an attitude, I was working and the suggestions were not logical for the situation. if its on the wrong channel; you wont get video. its a troubleshooting step. and the easiest and most common one. so its always the first thing to check. next thing would be is everything getting power"
"Explain how that would change on the drone? Headset maybe, but the drone would not change","we dont know if you set it correctly Its attitude. You just said: ""Ur suggestions were not logical for the situation"".  Well they probably dont seem logical for you, but for our troubleshooting it is important to start at the smallest things and before we start taking stuff apart its easiest to yk.. check if its configured right You could also probably see if theres anything wrong with the VTX in the software Its context, not attitude. I could read the comments about his soldering as attitude.   Its not the first flight, its been flying fine. Its just taken a hit. So elsr is likely to be the issue. So checking wiring first. the wiring is good. theres nothing wrong with it ELRS has nothing to do with the Video the coloring scheme is wrong but that wont mean that it doesnt work"
The radio transmission works fine right? Its only the video transmission that isnt working rn correct?,So get that ELRS thing out of your head. It has nothing to do with video transmission That sounds like attitude lol Its just a fact. We said it before no... the reciever is good. it has absolutely nothing to do with video The issue is no video to goggles
Yes. We know that. And why do you think ELRS has something to do with it?,its 2 completly seperate systems
What receives the transmission to the goggles?,The goggles receive. The VTX transmits
What does it use to transmit the signal?,the flight controller. whoch uses the esc. which used the battery
So it doesn't need an aerial?,the esc or battery cant be the problem cause then the entire thing wouldnt power on. so its either your fc is wronglx configured or your vtx/fc is broken. its most likely the configuration. or the connection between the two ok. so. video transmitter tab. screenshot. and then we can see if anything wrong. its just a reassurance. you might know its correct but we dont
Red: VTX (transmits video to the goggles) Purple: FC & ESC (Flight controller and electronic speed controller) Blue: Receiver (receives signal from radio). The red one is what is probably having problems here. But we want to check the software of the VTX (red mark) first before going into hardware related stuff. @DDogUK So. Are you sending us the screenshot now or?,"your vtx table could also be set up wrong. but only way for us to know is.. you guessed it...; seeing the video transmitter tab @DDogUK   Respectfully. If you come into a channel and ask for help. Let people help you. We do this because we have fun at it. If you know everything better anyway just fix it yourself and don´t ask for help.. Thank you. Good luchk & happy flying they're offline chill out people have more important things to do sometimes. they'll be back sooner or later and ask the exact same questions its not the not responding thats the problem. its the not cooperating were tryna help but hes refusing help And also a ""oh sry. i gtg. thanks anyways"" would be nice.. But it wasnt about that fair enough. sorry only read the last few messages"
Should I use DSHOT300 when I have PID loop and gyro update frequenzy at 3.20khz?,I was eating dinner. Sorry... lol
All good.. Are we getting the screenshots now or do you want no help anymore? @DDogUK,Hes getting them. Sorry i was gone aswell i was working on putting the drone back together
That black cylinder is the capacitor right? So I don't need to get a power connector that includes the capacitor,Also can you guys PLEASE tell ddoguk that we dont need the white board above the stack yeah you dont just attach the battery strap normally underneath the top plate. like that ah that. Yeah no leave that off please
Are you saying correct to me?,Alr bet. That's what I thought but didn't want to do sum dumb
I got Skystars H743 Dual Gyro FC. Someone told me to use DSHOT300 over 600 because there is no use for 600 in my case. Is that true?,"id turn low power disarm off but it seems fine. take your props off, plug the battery in and see if the ""device ready"" thing on the right changes. and check if theres any LEDs shining on the VTX Device is ready. Green light"
what do you see in the goggles?,you sure cause this is not the correct frequency
does it say 5600 as the frequency still?. like in the picture i mentioned,on your goggles. not your vtx. the screen of your analog reciever module. it showed 5600. which is way below what any vtx transmits Its 5917 on the goggles too picture please. alright. can you see any LEDs at the bottom of your vtx. there should be 3. you still havent put tape around your reciever One red light. Oh wait. Ddoguk wont let me alright we will see once your reciever shorts out on your frame or vtx heatsink and fries your 5v regulator and your reciever. thats fine by me. red or orange. and blinking or not Ignore that.. Goto bed milo lol The elrs is separate. It was protected in form. To protect it from touching anything. Foam Because it was removed But it was placed on the side of the drone. Which wasnt the best idea well.. why wont you just put tape around it unless youre like supergluing stuff to there it wont break anything Can tape it up like a mummy when it's working
is the light turning blue or green when both are on?. on the reciever,Needs soldering now...  Yes was bound. It was flying. Just the video was going to goggles ok so reciever works. reciever is donezo nothing you need to do with it
Does the video not come from the elrs aerial?,nope. thats just for controlling the drone. elrs is a control link protocol. could i get a photo of the ports tab in betaflight
what's the issue here?,something with an elrs reciever and something with getting no video two Serial RX is definitely not correct why is serial RX on for uart 6. yeah your reciever is on UART 2
Why would that come on?,"Because someone turned it on Its not been connected to beta flight since the crash well.. someone turned it on. just turn it off for uart 6 This is what it was set too previously. From original settings. alright. its not supposed to be like that tho. yep save and reboot have you tested the ELRS reciever. or well have you flashed it yet Can't. My little helper accidentally caught the wire, so needs re soldering ah. well ive only made a single analog quadcopter and that was a few months ago so im not sure what your video problem might be Its all been working fine. He's been out flying it a few times. Maybe needs rebinding we can get to that once you resolder the cable Ok. Thanks for advise. Appreciated even if it didn't sound it. please please please put something around your reciever tho. its not worth loosing a drone over It did have. I built a plastic casing for it. id still just use electrical tape Then it was protected in foam.. Poor placement of building left few options to put it somewhere.. Was isolated from the rest though. Just on the side, not ideal Wait can someone send a picture of their drone with a battery strap on it i want to prove something Strap above flight controller and below the top plate Wait wait my dad might have a point. Because my elrs wire goes backwards. And i cant put the strap in because they collide Theres not one point that would reason the battery strap to go anywhere else. Looks very clean btw How do I know when my tinywhoop batteries are dead and it’s time to land I have 1s. 350 mah Re soldered. Vtx is flashing.. Fixed. Vtx unlocked seemed to flush whatever the issue was."
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  so with these two I can replace the PSU right?. solder the 20v together and the xt60 then just plug on both ends and got it?,voltage under like 3.3v I would uh. check if that one can actually handle 100W. those are some small looking pads. and traces
how do i check? or should I just get something that looks like it can handle it?,pretty much. that's the gamble with cheapo AliE random boards
and if it can't handle 100W?. will it just not work or is there a chance for breakage?,"it'll get hot :p. all the board is doing is negotiating with the charger on what it should give it ehm il try and look for something more capable Is this gap normal on the pyrodrone source 1 v5 5"" OK so. Do both the 30mm standoffs go on the very ends. And then the 22mm ones in the middle uh. it should all be level. so long in front. short in back Yeah that's what I have rn you sure its not the other way around"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I am assuming I still need a breakout board with this right?  https://www.amazon.com/Euogeudel-Trigger-Cable-Female-Delivery/dp/B0CBC9G8N4/ref=sr_1_12_sspa,ok what did you do man you have your midplate over your arms If 22mm was here I don't think the top frame could work wait no. bottom plate. the front plate. goes underneath the arms. not above
no it says it has it built in. I think?. most likely,"look at the front plate on my S1. should be like that I am not sure, but I also think it does I wanna change my rates to match my ones in velo why is no d min is it the same thing as derivative. And do I set the d max and d min to zero since it’s not even on velo"
"Hi all, I'm trying to get into the hobby and am considering buying a BETAFPV LiteRadio 2 SE to use with liftoff to understand if fpv is something I enjoy and want to invest more in the future. Do you guys think this is a good purchase at this stage?","The LiteRadio 2 is a *terrible* investment due to its build quality, lack of compatibility, and lack of flexibility"
Even the expresslsr version?,"I'd strongly steer you towards the Radiomaster Pocket, Zorro, and Boxer, all of which are better in pretty much every way Zorro being at the bottom of the list and boxer at the top"
"Alright, guess I'll have to set a bit more money aside first then. Pocket above zorro?","They are about equal imo, with a slight advantage to the pocket The Pocket is only $65. It's essentially dirt cheap. Please also take a look at the https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 to get an idea of how much it costs to get into FPV at the ground floor and have a good experience"
"65+battery tho, right?","18650 batteries are very cheap I'll check out the shopping list ty Thanks for the help guys Also, can we one day add the cobra x v2 goggles to the list and eventually the goggles L, cause the list would need a bit of a refresh honestly Yea it needs a little bit of a refresh, i just haven't taken the time Well I'm going to head over to #feedback to submit a refresh then"
are there any sites for buying used FPV drone parts other than facebook marketplace/ebay? or are those my best bet?,Those are generally the best options right now
"what accessories should i get for my meteor 75, such as extra parts?",Please someone help me-my drone took off and started spiraling crazy in giant circles and i had no control and it crashed and the battery wasnt in it when i found it  crashed. Why did this happen Im new to this what does that mean Wdym disarm. Like i tried to control the drone but it just went crazy and then i tried to hit return to home but it wouldnt you arm the drone to fly. disarm = dis-arm = turn the arming off. = turn the drone off It’s gps was connected and it said ready for takeoff my messages must not be getting through @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) so with the [motors](https://pyrodrone.com/products/axisflying-ae2207-v2-6s-economic-freestyle-fpv-drone-motor-1960kv) and [stack](https://pyrodrone.com/products/iflight-blitz-atf435-e55s-2-6s-stack-combo-atf435-fc-55a-8bit-4in1-esc-30x30) i bought am i able to solder the motor wires to the board or do i need a plug so that they can plug in to the ports on it
@acorn_16 why didn't you turn the drone off when it went crazy?,"you solder the motors to the escs nvm i just saw the pins if you want a plug you use an MT30 or maybe racewire It was over water i didnt know what to do why are you maidening your drone over water No i took it off near water then it flew over to the water without me even doing anything and it flew in crazy circles around me on land and the water what drone is it anyway It was a potensic atom se. The drone battery wasnt in the drone when i found it crashed on the ground oh, so a toyish camera drone Was it possible the battery fell out somehow. I don’t understand why it started flying crazy. Like it was flying itself Yeah that's unfortunate, unfortunately there's nothing we can do to help with that as there is nothing to support on stuff like this. But do you guys know why that even happened like how did it just fly itself wtf"
Where were you flying anyway? Roughly.,"You should return it to Amazon or wherever you got it from and get something that isn't a toy/broken from the box I got this weeks ago and it’s worked great up till now I mean, you can run into this issue with anything that flies primarily by GPS and disregards pilot's controls ......................... But how did the battery fall out i literally made sure it clicked in I mean Country. or something like that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. stuff bends on impact Near a small town on the coast WHICH COAST. OF WHICH LANDMASS. ahh whatever oh I know where. :globe_showing_Americas:. here u go lmao. In some European countries you can run into issues with GPS jamming. That's what I was trying to get to @acorn_16. If you weren't flying in Europe then that point is moot ofc. Anyway, the flying in crazy circles thing actually has a name! Toiletbowling! It's fully possible that the drone's firmware doesn't have a very well written GPS sanity check. or the magnetometer decided to go wacko. It's all unfortunately too common for toy stuff like this :/ Well the battery probably fell out when the drone hit the ground https://tenor.com/view/front-fell-off-not-normal-gif-27006005 *found the guy who doesn't know ""the front fell off""*"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM,"ye. i watched already. well. i have to admit - i did not know that your message just really sounded like ""the front fell off when a wave hit it"" https://tenor.com/view/snake-gentleman-hatehat-cute-tongue-gif-12731748"
s. Is the environment safe tho? Did the drone get towed beyond the environment,I mean it clearly fell beyond the environment. there was no splash when it fell ah. So the environment is indeed safe. Interestig prop mounting there. Why not just one prop It's actually fairly usual nowadays It's just an easy way of having folding props didnt think of that. im dumb everything for the environment :folded_hands: And folding props increase efficiency outside of making it more pocketable. Same thing. Just slightly different doesn't matter if you're beyond the environment
but what if the environment is close?,then you tow the environment away
So connecting a elrs Transmitter to my flight controller. https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1S2Zjs9WKGPMQESZM7kqxdKYYtktiUL_N/17Uf67I6ER_z-otviR0I7tSqO31W7S553?sort=13&direction=a,"What drone do you recommend getting instead What pins would I for RX, TX, tx to rx rx to tx voltage to proper voltage ground to ground. boom. whichever you want I assume I use one of the ones labeled T# and R# yeah as long as the numbers match. pick ones in a convenient spot"
good battery charger? i dont need it to have multiple ports,"Hota's for AC-integrated and ToolkitRC otherwise also can u please give me a rundown on these receivers. which one youd reccomend. thank you elrs 2.4 is all you should need. TBS stuff is outdated compared to it if you have an ELRS 2.4GHz radio and PNP is add your own https://www.getfpv.com/radiomaster-boxer-radio-transmitter-4-in-1-multi-protocol-cc2500-elrs-2-ghz.html  also looking at boxers. im sorry i ask a lot of questions lol but its cuz ive been busy If you take the Boxer ExpressLRS 2.4GHz, then the ELRS 2.4G receiver will be compatible.. It's a very good radio btw."
so the one listed above comes with built in compatibility with elrs 2.4GHz?,"If it is the ELRS 2.4ghz model then yeah, otherwise no you want the ELRS one. not the 4in1"
OOH. i got confused. it says it comes with the elrs 2.4 version however i gotta find it lol. there. just had to get the right version. whats the benefit with ac integrated. also is skyrc reccomended?. if i need to pay a hefty price to ensure my house wont turn into scorch then i will,that's pretty much it
"i have a weird problem where my transmitter and reciever bind, and telemetry works, but there is no movement in betaflight. What could cause this?","AC-integrated just means it comes with a power supply in a tiny package and the only ones who do that reliably is Hota. If you get ToolkitRC you need an external power supply, and cheap ones are bulky but it is more cost-effective.. Hota D6 Pro is probably the cheapest thats what ill end up getting. F6+ is like 200 dollars. but also double the charger"
c-rating is sadly pretty useless as a whole. as it's a per-manufacturer thing. what mAh you get boils down to the weight. you don't want a way too heavy battery. and a way too light one is underpowered. What're you getting?,Are these 4 holes to mount a VTX Well my lite kit is too small to fit it. Not sure how I'll mount it zip ties through the screw hole like everyone else
like all lazy people*. how?. 20x20 right?. or is the vtx 25x25?. You can always print a little adapter even to put it on the stack,"I'd argue it takes more effort to zip get a zip tie through there im going to assume 25x25. it seems a little too big and the screw holes seem too small. anyway im tired of building ive spent like an hour alone figuring out how get the stack on right. doesnt help that only 3/4 screws are long enough, i guess they gave me 1 wrong one im just gonna try mounting the motors and call it a day. im gonna have to figure out something for the VTX since the port it plugs in to is off to the side. and i dont got a way of mounting it. We sadly do not ball I really thought you had a 3d printer well then print a mount not sure of the nozzle size though so i havent do anything with it yet. all ive done with it so far is slap klipper on it you can temporarily just. double sided tape + zip ties. not the most durable thing but it works"
Do you think it would be fine if the battery was on the bottom?,Just want to verify these props are facing out right congrats on being the first person ever to take the picture at an angle where you can actually see if they are. you really shouldn't Well I'm gonna have to wait to buy the batteries and see if the cable gives me issues. Wish the cable was more flexible
"yeah, i ended up figuring it out. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) do you think it would be possible to move the capacitor on the stack?",oddity rc 35xi or maybe the mage we will see.. probably the xi35 just go with the recommended how can i add an offset to my gyroscope its the only thing stopping me from having my stack facing the way its supposed to be just make sure it fits saw one guy do a build where he had the capacitor off to the side on the frame. i could try that but idk how to remove the capacitor thats already on the board yeah its looking risky lol. people on reddit said that it can be removed with a soldering iron but you have to wiggle it a bit to expose the metal holding it in place
what???. also your battery leads. will not hold,https://www.reddit.com/r/fpv/comments/16t6jon/any_tips_on_how_to_remove_the_cap_from_an_iflight/ oh it's an smd one. yeah you don't have the gear for that. I don't know if I even trust your battery leads to survive 1 light landing
the fact that they're not really soldered at all?. more like glued. it feels like a light tug will rip them right off,ill probably go to home depot and make my own cable or something consider how my stack is mounted. dont think the cable is really going to work out with having to bend it along with the short length to buy 12awg wire. i already have xt60 connectors
Anybody own a jumper t20 here?,Can anyone help me in radio calibration of the er6 connection to pixhawk 2.4.8 and transmitter is tx16s but the problem here is the green bars in the mission planner does not moves when i move the triggers on the transmitter.
can i use a radiomaster pocket with no batteries to fly sim?,"You need to have batteries to turn it on Im new to drones i have seen some games which people use to  learn to fly an fpv drone, is there a good game for this and a good but kinda budget compatible controller. Thank you For simulator: LiftOff and Velocidrone; For controller: Radiomaster Pocket/Zorro/Boxer. For the radio you might need to buy batteries"
"I just got bored one day :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. and some things in my head which I already knew clicked together. I knew that these radios use the same chips as FC's, understood the firmware update mode issue, and realised that there's the exit DFU button. and I thought like *there's no way that could work, right?*","There is a way but it is slightly sketch. And sort of confusing :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. **The issue: ** Normally, when you connect a turned OFF radio via USB to your PC, it will go into Firmware Update mode.  Pressing the power button in this state does nothing, so the radio is stuck in that mode.  Even holding the power button while plugging USB in seems to not work.   But there's a workaround :slightly_smiling_face:  **Prep: ** You need a PC with Betaflight configurator installed, and if on windows, with fixed drivers.  With the radio turned off, plug its data (top) USB port into your PC. You need to use an A-C cable. C-C probably won't work. The USB port must be capable of providing a lot of power, so you don't want to have unpowered USB hubs in the way.   **First time setup on windows (shouldn't be needed again or at least for a while): ** Download and run ImpulseRC Driver Fixer. It's meant for FC's but it fixes the firmware update drivers for this radio as well. If it throws any warnings about chrome, ignore them.   **The process:** (With the radio connected as described in prep) Open Betaflight Configurator.  Go into Firmware Flasher tab.  At the bottom of it, you should see a ""Exit DFU"" button.  On the radio, hold the power button.   In BF Configurator, click Exit DFU. The radio will reboot.  Because you're holding the power button, it should boot up into EdgeTX.   **Source: Figured this out with my own Pocket**  @Scotch :crown:. could be interesting info to you as well @Gomes Basically every time to connect to PC need to repeat the process. https://tenor.com/view/really-willsmith-hmm-well-sarcastic-gif-18053026837878396159 just ""the process"" part. Open BF configurator, hold radio power button, click exit DFU Will try it when the pocket to my gf arrives :Howdy: Once you have the prep figured out and the drivers fixed, it works reliably. no warranty from me tho :face_with_tears_of_joy:. and it really has some steep power requirements. my monitor's USB hub can't do it a powered USB hub can, and some USBs on my PC can too (but not all). turning down the backlight and volume on the radio seems to help. and turning off the ELRS module ofc i dont even ask how did u manage all that. what a rat :Useyourhead: Oh thanks alot!! I'll try right now"
"Heyy, quick question, is there a big difference in video quality between dji action 2 and gopro11? I have A2 and alwyas fly at some sick spot just to see that the shot looks shit afterwards…. Or mabe my skill is the problem :grinning_face_with_sweat:","The actual image/video quality is good from both cameras. If the image quality itself is bad, that's a settings problem. If the *shot* is bad, that's a *you* problem"
is a failed firmware flash recoverable? i m getting like no data chip found or something but the driver rrecognizes the comport.. and no driver when i try bootloader mode.,Just download the immersionrc driver fixer and use that yea i tried that. it also kinda freaks out. not sure of the exact error ill get it.
"Hey guys, the operational voltage for the Radiomaster Zorro is 6.6-8.4v, but the li-ion batteries can be discharged further down to around 2.5-2.8. If the voltage goes below 6.6, does that harm the controller or is there going to be a sudden shutoff or something?","I dont have the zorro, but with boxer it automatically shuts off at around 6v but before that it normally operates, but dont take my word for it Boxer has the same voltage range so I'm going to assume similar behavior. I'll leave the low battery warning at 6.6 and keep it in mind if i get to 6 its probably going to cut itself off Yea, i have it the same way, i usually have my liions fully charged all the time but sometimes i run them down to 3v"
whats ur like battery range and low battery warning at for the boxer?,"good morning. i need some help flashing firmware onto my crux35 elrs through betaflight. when i try and flash im immediately met with the error ""no response from bootloader, programming failed"""
are you sure that it has a Serial receiver?,"I setup an alarm for 6.6v so i know i should charge my radio, but the actual range i setup to 6.4 volts just to shut the radio up:grinning_face_with_sweat: i have no idea. i dont really know much about this ive just tried to follow setup tutorials for the crux35 elrs The alarm at 6.6v just says like low battery 3 times and thats all id rather it whine forever so ill leave it as is, and put it to like 6.5 or smth. thx for the info @Mety send a link to what crux35 you bought and we can take a look and see what it has No problem:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: https://pyrodrone.com/products/happymodel-crux35-analog-elrs-v2-2-4ghz-4s-with-caddx-ant-camera-micro-freestyle-fpv-drone-bnf. pretty sure this is it. i bought it 18 months ago Integrated ExpressLRS UART receiver so it should be serial, not spi that's fine then. get a screenshot of the Receiver tab no habla englis. i was more so saying it for vitroid lol"
odd. can you take a photo of the AIO board inside it?,"like i said i purchased it 18 months ago youll most likely get interference so not recommended, but it shouldnt like fry anything, itll just be shit range or bad video, fly at your own risk sorta thing idk if i can get a good picture without taking off the top frame Ah well there is a ton of Long grass in the field so prolly best to avoid it yeah that might be needed fuck. are there any in-the-moment things i can try. just to try and successfully flash we need to verify if the board runs an SPI or Serial receiver. if it's SPI, it wouldn't need to be flashed via ELRS Configurator at all i really dont have to tools or the time to disassemble my drone right now. is there an alternative option to verifying the type of reciever"
you can check the target in betaflight right? you havent flashed betaflight at all right?,"ive been using betaflight but the flash fails to even start. you can check #drone-general about the other error i was having last night while attempting to flash. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1258876238144082001/1262984365516783648 in betaflight, screenshot the top left corner, it should say a version and etc. well just off the listing for the board, it is an SPI elrs. https://pyrodrone.com/products/happymodel-expresslrs-elrs-f4-flight-controller-aio-5a-4in1-esc-5-8g-40ch-vtx-spi-2-4ghz-elrs-receiver-for-rc-drone ok cool so how do i flash it if its an spi board the receiver compatibility version is tied to the betaflight firmware. Betaflight 4.3 will be compatible with ELRS 2.x radios, BF 4.4+ will be compatible with ELRS 3.x radios"
so i should downgrade my betaflight?,"update. your radio most likely has ELRS 3.x ive been trying to flash it with 4.5. the whole time. everytime it just says ""no response from bootloader"""
are you entering bootloader mode or DFU mode?. or are you just connecting the quad and trying to flash it?,"this. i literally have no idea what im doing lmaoo so the quad normally wont allow a flash, there's a DFU mode that must be etnered first, where the quad is ""dumb"" and just connects as a BOOTLOADER device, which then allows it to be flashed. honestly before actually doing that, you'd want to back up the config, and learn more about flashing it up Probably use the Molicells... fake cells are never trustworthy"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhmtF44OH4. its time to learn,"i backed it up last night :thumbs_up:. can you elaborate on how to enter DFU mode press the BOOT BUTTON while connecting the cable to the FC Well il replace them after this session it should then appear as STM32 BOOTLOADER where the hell is the boot button Next to the usb port, left of it. Its also labeled BOOT cool. ig disassembly required. because its on the inaccessible side of the board Will I be able to run these batteries on a 3.5 inch quad (only 35c) Just would've been nice to reuse"
Whats a main board?. And how does it work,"It's the *main* board, the one that does the computing and stuff, in the case of fpv it would  be the FC, or flight controllers, and a very watered down explanation is that it just gets information from the different sensors (gyro, accelerometer, sometimes baro/esc/gps etc) feeds it into the MCU, it thinks real hard and then tells the esc what it should make the motors do im having a problem with my radiomaster tx12 mkii where i try and open ExpressLRS in on the system page but it just freezes on loading and never loads did you set elrs in your model settings nvm i got it. i forgot i reset my models. i may have just figured out every problem ive been having. fuck"
anybody know if the date and time glitch for edgetx was ever fixed...?,i installed elrsv2 onto my radio and it finally binded to the drone. the only problem is uhhhh. these models are fucked up you need to use elrs v3. not v2
??. this drone uses v2,"no, just update it... you did everything in reverse"
Shoud i get bms for custum made battery?,I have no idea even where is bms used even... i cannot update the firmware of my drone without physically dismantling the entire fucking thing what drone is it. because I doubt that is true. in any way okay and you don't have access to the usb port the boot switch is on the bottom completely covered up i have to put it into dfu mode yes it does that for you. can you just show how you're trying to flash it it did not put it into dfu mode a screenshot. yes it did
Bms does that when you lipo is too low it will shut it down i mean it wont draw curent?,"partly yes, it also balances the cells for if your charger doesn't. most do"
Does that mean i need only main plug?,Oh nice then it saves my time soldering :) no. you still have to connect all the balance wires to the BMS Into the bms will go 3 wires and from will go 2
Ye i mean ik but its harder to solder more wires on 1 pad on battery. It will heat up?,"and then i hit load firmware online. and then flash firmware. and im immediately met with what version of the configurator is this can you connect and go to the CLI i would if i knew what the CLI was it's a tab. I'm not telling you how to do things you wouldn't know okay yeah the console is pretty much empty ok. that just disconnected like, my pc device manager. windows"
?. okay where do i go in device manager,look for STM32 bootloader or something with a yellow triangle thing. it's been a while since i've used windows this is the closest thing i have'
can sb help me at all?,oh nm. its not giving the error triangle but here go to the flashing tab in betaflight no. stop. please. enable expert mode yes. and top right. select stm32 bootloader as device and full chip reset or no already done. it wont let me autodetect so ima have to find it well. autodetecting might've ruined it. but okay. yes
now i can load firmware online and flash?,yup. make sure you have the correct thing selected top right
its the only thing there dw. and now i can load my backup from last night?,i mean you can try but things might've changed between versions. but try it
is there a better way then?. im just going off of the tutorial i tried to follow last night,just put in your backup. see what goes on. see the errors. lol. that's whatever
so im good to reinstall elrsv3 on my radio and everything should work??,yeah. and you're on the latest betaflight now ok. the radio and drone are now bound. but when i arm it and give it throttle. the motors do not go do the motors not spin when you arm it i can see that the drone recieves the arming signal. but the motors dont move. nope
of course it doesn't work with your usb plugged in???,no its on a battery right now. lmao did you plug the battery in while it was connected to usb lemme get them hold on. the goggles dont say shit. i can see through the camera. but i just get the small green text telling me the channel and battery
could it be that the battery level is too low?. no. am i cooked,it's the bnf right. in Betaflight can you scroll down on the configuration tab and make sure OSD is enabled
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) if cells are perfectly balanced 2s and i just have a main plug is it okay?,"i turned on osd and theres still no display of anything. no text saying armed, no bf logo. im going to go get ready i have to be at a rehearsal in 2 hours No. Cause your cells aren't *perfectly* balanced So you need a balance plug They have high needs... You will just end up over charging or over discharging one of the two"
Why would you even want one ?. Just use a balance plug when charging it,"Idk :person_shrugging: that is why i am asking Well, if you don't know why you would need one it's probably that you don't need one, simply using a balance plug when charging is perfectly fine"
"does anyone has a list of parts that are budget friendly for a student and can help with learning drones? for example, includes stuff like flight controllers, eetc",@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) #deleted-channel is a good start havent seen this image in a while Oh man that thing is so old And still just as condescending :skull::skull::skull: There's a reason why we stopped using it Can you *not* ping every mod about it they were the two people helping me with my issue and then i kinda dipped for a minute
"I assume you're using analog FPV? Are you on v4.5.0? If so, did you include OSD in the flashing configuration?","didnt u say u have to leave for a rehearsal yeah, let's not say things like this I mean, he already pinged you right before mind your own, you clearly don't have any context its too expensive :loudly_crying_face: It's unfortunately about as cheap as you can get into fpv whilst having not shit hardware not fpv. i just want a rc controlled or drone. maybe controlled by esp8266 or some cheap radio control. just to learn how to make drones and get more robotics experience Does this look sketchy ohhh no i didnt put it in flashing config"
'made from scratch' can be the right word? my own code and assembling myself,cetus pro :skull:. ok i will reflash in a minute I said *not shit hardware* :cat_with_tears_of_joy:. im so glad i didnt buy one 2 years ago i mean its not a *terrible* indoor whoop Every betafpv beginner oriented kit is terrible no i just have to get ready for one thats now in an hour and a half
typically that's more expensive because then you don't have economies of scale working for you. what motors and motor drivers will you use? how much would buying the FETs and MCU and getting a board etched and then soldering everything cost vs just getting an ESC?,I have an esp8266 and I am trying to use bldc for which I have budget for ( including the esc )
"I guess for the controller you could go lower maybe. can you assemble an ELRS reciever, a microcontroller, and some joysticks for under $65?","My max budget is 50 :loudly_crying_face:. I found motors for like 20-25. It was a kit including the esc, propellers and mounting stuff. I am thinking of a bicopter sort of you'd need some high power precise servos for that. depending on the scale"
"Where should I post stuff to give away?  Private sales doesn't seem right.. I have some 5"" frames with motors I never used or stopped using.",Only for people I have never interacted with here.
So noobs. What channel would be appropriate?,"I don't think we really have a channel for it, private sales could be right but you might want to ask someone else my dms ||just joking I don't need it buut... ya know|| how do i put it in the flashing config do i just change the settings with my drone connected and then flash it ohh ok. i flashed it with osd. and then turned my goggles on. there was no picture from the camera, but there was on-screen text which matched what i set up in the osd panel. however. when i tried putting my drone on its battery, the camera no longer connects with the goggles did you do the restoring backup"
"oh shit. my stupid ass forgor. i loaded the preset and it made all my stick movements whack. again. in the reciever tab, the drone is constantly flipping and the stick movements are mismatched. example: moving the right stick horizontally is now throttle. it was correct before i restored the backup. should i find a different preset. ?",on the right. channel map. change it to be correct on my way to rehearsal i wont be back home for 4 hours :victory_hand:
cant just flash the correct firmware?,"I'll ask, maybe they haven't tried that yet. they said there's only one flashable version and its this one how about. they just follow the official guide. <https://manual.edgetx.org/installing-and-updating-edgetx>. specifically this. <https://manual.edgetx.org/installing-and-updating-edgetx/update-from-opentx-to-edgetx-1> Ok I'll send this to them and hopefully it helps. Thanks"
"If you build your own fpv drone, how will you know which controller/radio and goggles you need to use?","You just need to make sure the parts you use are the same protocol. You need to pick one protocol for the control link, and one for the video link just looking at what signals/boards and shit will speak to eachother in the same language. basically for the record, use ExpressLRS for controller protocl. (RadioMaster, Jumper). nothing else is worth it"
did it disable the osd?. in the configuration tab,"Pocket is the cheapest worth getting, it's a perfectly fine radio @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i fixed my whack stick bindings but i still cant get it to arm Do you know goggles that work with the pocket, that cost around a hundred. EV800D are the only ones and they suck. but they work well, they're just not comfortable loading my backup removed osd.... and now it wont do osd i just get plain camera feed yes. and then i would have to reflash it. and then load my backup. and it would be a cycle it doesnt work without reflash paste your backup in here should i just. make another backup right now with osd ""enabled"". and then reflash no. show a screenshot of the osd tab like with the backup loaded. i can re enable it and change osd tab settings. but it doesnt show anything in goggles. im having some unique ass issues aren't i can you do `diff all` in the CLI and post it here in my backup should i just add ""feature OSD"" where it is in my diff all. and then reflash and load the backup no... that's not how things work if you enabled it in the configuration tab it's enabled yeah but like. nothing is showing in my goggles yes i know. ``` resource FLASH_CS 1 A14 resource OSD_CS 1 B12 save ```. put that in the CLI okay. nothing happened besides the drone rebooting just because I'm curious. try just putting this in the CLI if it doesn't work, reflash it and don't restore the backup whatsoever yeah that didnt do anything. reflashing. i should worry about this later. right just place it flat and press calibrate i cant really do that when its got a fat ass microusb cable on the bottom .... what an interesting design choice ``` # serial serial 1 2048 115200 57600 0 115200  # beacon beacon RX_LOST beacon RX_SET  # map map TAER1234  # aux aux 0 0 0 1800 2100 0 0 aux 1 1 1 1800 2100 0 0  # adjrange adjrange 0 0 1 900 1200 12 1 0 0 adjrange 1 0 1 1200 1800 12 1 0 0 adjrange 2 0 1 1800 2100 12 1 0 0  # vtxtable vtxtable bands 6 vtxtable channels 8 vtxtable band 1 BOSCAM_A A FACTORY 5865 5845 5825 5805 5785 5765 5745 5725 vtxtable band 2 BOSCAM_B B FACTORY 5733 5752 5771 5790 5809 5828 5847 5866 vtxtable band 3 BOSCAM_E E FACTORY 5705 5685 5665 5645 5885 5905 5925 5945 vtxtable band 4 FATSHARK F FACTORY 5740 5760 5780 5800 5820 5840 5860 5880 vtxtable band 5 RACEBAND R FACTORY 5658 5695 5732 5769 5806 5843 5880 5917 vtxtable band 6 LOWRACE  L FACTORY 5333 5373 5413 5453 5493 5533 5573 5613 vtxtable powerlevels 5 vtxtable powervalues 10 2 14 20 26 vtxtable powerlabels 0 RCE 25 100 400  # master set acc_trim_pitch = -4 set acc_calibration = 0,-2,116,1 set blackbox_device = SERIAL set dshot_idle_value = 500 set dshot_burst = OFF set dshot_bidir = ON set motor_pwm_protocol = DSHOT300 set motor_poles = 12 set align_board_yaw = -90 set vbat_min_cell_voltage = 320 set vbat_warning_cell_voltage = 330 set ibata_scale = 470 set yaw_motors_reversed = ON set small_angle = 180 set deadband = 1 set yaw_deadband = 1 set pid_process_denom = 4  set debug_mode = RX_EXPRESSLRS_SPI set vtx_band = 5 set vtx_channel = 4 set vtx_power = 5 set vtx_low_power_disarm = ON set vtx_freq = 5769 set vcd_video_system = NTSC set flash_spi_bus = 0 set expresslrs_uid = 0,0,164,119,214,232 set expresslrs_rate_index = 3 set name = CRUX35  profile 0  # profile 0 set p_pitch = 50 set d_pitch = 43 set p_roll = 53 set i_roll = 95 set d_roll = 41 set f_roll = 91 set p_yaw = 55 set i_yaw = 95 set f_yaw = 91 set d_min_roll = 33 set d_min_pitch = 35  save ```. i cut out anything that would possibly touch the OSD I THINK ok now its normal. btw theres not osd in my goggles. lmao go to OSD tab. well first make sure OSD is enabled in configuration tab. then go to OSD tab. and change NTSC to Auto its on auto. still nothing. if i new trying to set this shit up would be such a pain in the ass i wouldnt have bought ts well it sure isn't supposed to be maybe my opinions will change if i ever get to fly it. i figured not this is confusing as hell my luck. if any of the helpers here live near me i should just hand my shit over to them and let them play around with it all goggles will because the video and control link are entirely unrelated https://www.happymodel.cn/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Betaflight-4.4.2-dump-file-for-Crux35-analog-ELRS-V2.txt. try this one.

OMG OMG FUCK. ITS WORKING. HOLY SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK. its controlling it is really laggy though lmfaoo. and when i mess with the Yaw on the stick, it starts going back and forth really fucking fast. its almost like its not in acro you don't have props on yeah but that doesnt explain the fact that it just it's trying to correct itself and be where it should even though it can't and you're hurting its poor brain oh gotcha. well its like pitch black so i dont think flying is a great idea. but. i kinda wanna try it now :loudly_crying_face:. also the gyro is still fucked. and it wont balance with this chonky cable in the back"
no streetlights?. or anything?,i live in the south. in a small ass neighborhood
"so?. buy a streetlight. ``` set acc_trim_pitch = -4 set acc_calibration = 0,-2,116,1 save ```",wow I hate that word. just hold the drone. as straight as you can. it's genuinely good enough if you're flying acro its straight its just not tilting the right way when i tilt it. easy (im unemployed and a minor) oh. that's a whole different issue sorry i meant accelerometer ``` set align_board_yaw = -90 save ``` the most important thing is that we somehow managed to get the drone to arm. its still a little off-centered it should be fine tho right. are you fucking shitting me rn. i cant get it to arm now okay. so you had it plugged into usb. it's not going to arm if you're plugged into usb or if you plugged in the battery before unplugging from usb just replug the battery and it'll arm okay its arming fine. my batteries are running low now. ive been switching between two batteries all day. ima charge one tn. im excited to fucking destroy this bitch tomorrow (joke). @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) is there anything else i should do or am i good to fly tmrw set everything to 250hz. expresslrs wise oh. its at 500. skull
it's an spi receiver right?,"> These are the packet rates that will work: 50Hz, 150Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz.. oh. 500Hz does work now. neat. so in betaflight go to the presets tab and search 500Hz"
get the expresslrs one??,"yeah. I just didn't specify ExpressLRS because I didn't know if it was shortened to ELRS or not should i select Freestyle in the fine-tuning freestyle, SPI, single cell values. I don't know why there's so many options now lol such an odd word for a select button okay now it just naturally spazzes out when arming. but thats just another instance of not having props ig I'm sure you'll find out. lol until tmrw. :skull:. okay so im good now right @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) thank you so so much for being so patient with me and my unfortunate luck lmao. i really appreciate it I still don't quite get what the issue was me neither. but we are okay now. until this thing catches fire in the sky tmrw because it felt like it okay gn im gonna wake up early tmrw so if theres some other issue i will have time tmrw to troubleshoot LMAO. dont worry i will torture another helper. daedalus is next"
just try again?. what are you flashing,it was at one point a stm32f411. betaflight is no response from bootloader flashing failed.. well. looks like another one for the graveyard.
what. can you just. take a second and actually try to solve your issues?. <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe>. first try the driver fixer,"well so i think theres other problems on this board.. that error message i posted was from the driver fixer unplug other things then. but anyways my son started the build and i finished it, and as i was about to bind it ... the ground came off and i think it touched the board somwhere.. after i soldered it back on drone didnt really boot.. thers nothing else plugged in. hold the boot button on the FC, plug it in while holding, let go. then go into device manager and see what it showed up as this fc doesnt have a boot button. strangley enough isn't it the betafpv 5a"
no its this one. https://www.banggood.com/Happymodel-SuperX-HD-ELRS-1-2S-AIO-Flight-Controlelr-Built-in-12A-ESC-and-UART-ELRS-Receiver-for-Digital-Whoop-RC-Drone-FPV-Racing-p-1999006.html?gmcCountry=US&currency=USD&cur_warehouse=CN&createTmp=1&ID=6265504,"This error is often fixed by restarting the PC.

"In worst cases, trying a different PC or using Zadig (a more manual driver fixer) is an alternative.. is it even a button or just two naked pads? :grinning_face_with_sweat:",two naked pads because they hate the user. just like everything else with the SuperX lol
"Hi, what is the difference between elrs and frsky? Is there a vid that explains this? The spec sheets aren’t helping me",@Yggdrasil this is definitely wrong. the board type. crazy :cow: 4DX :KEKw:
"Well, I’m just confused at how they differ at all?. So if they just send different radio signals as code but over the same frequency how can one be “better”?","FRSKY is a well established manufacturer of radios.  They make transmitters and receivers for a variety of their own proprietary protocols.  Most well known of these protocols are ACCST D8, D16 and ACCESS.  When you read that a drone is ""FRSKY"", it's means that it has a receiver that does one of these 3 (though not all 3).  ACCST is a fairly old-school digital protocol.  It would be best described as ""GFSK with frequency hopping"".  **GFSK is, nowadays, not a particularly efficient way of sending data over radio. ** ACCESS is similar, though we have little info about its inner workings.   Also, in the past couple of years, FRSKY managed to do an extremely good job of shooting themselves in the foot and alienating themselves from the community.  You won't see many people recommending their hardware. @arch-origamist. ExpressLRS is a modern open-source project focused on making a very efficient RC system.  ELRS project provides the firmware for ELRS devices.  ELRS doesn't manufacture hardware directly (outside of small batch DIY stuff),  but it provides examples for manufacturers on how to build proper hardware, and they facilitate testing of that hardware.  The ELRS protocol is based around modern LoRA and FHSS transmission technology.  LoRA and FHSS are both MUCH more efficient at transmitting data long range than GFSK.. For the same amount of power, LoRA will often give you an order of magnitude more range than GFSK. @arch-origamist. LoRA's range also scales up if you scale down how much data you're sending.  ELRS is extremely efficient with the amount of data that's being sent.. TLDR; ELRS is much more efficient at transmitting data compared to FRSKY. @arch-origamist. There is no point to FRSKY nowadays."
Gotcha. Thank you very much. That helps a ton. How did they shoot themselves in the foot?,"They broke compatibility with EXTREMELY prevalent 3rd party hardware (SPI receivers in whoops),  Then they broke it even more with ""V2"" firmwares,  Then they made R9 compatibility a massive mess Then they tried to turn OpenTX (an open source firmware project) proprietary, in the end killing the entire project (blessing in disguise lol) and then they may or may not have tried to rip off ELRS code for their own radios. And generally they didn't bother to innovate for many years That does sound quite bad In the end, Jumper and RadioMaster took FRSKY's Radio recipe and improved on it. FRSKY moved to making high end radios for rich old copter pilots and shit and ELRS became the accepted go-to protocol for this entire community. Because it just curbstomps pretty much all competition lmao I like my little radiomaster pocket. Works much better on sims than my taranis did. Just have to get my drone to be happy there too have a pocket too, very cool lil thing Portability is insane. Size too. btw, ELRS gained popularity as an alternative firmware for FRSKY's R9 hardware :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. ELRS got 10x more range out of that hardware than FRSKY ever could"
Has there been any advancement in goggles too or not yet?,"whew, depends. Analog hasn't changed in years. Digital is slowly getting cheaper Cool. I’ll stick with my old fat sharks"
"Hi, I had a pretty bad range with my Googles2 and Flywoo Explorer L4, as well as with my Avata 1 and Avata2.   I did the FCC hack, new channels appeared in the googles. It seems like the range is a bit better, but still - when I'm flying 200 -300 meters away from me.   is it even normal?  should I use 40 - 20 - 10 MHZ?","Yeah my range also isn't the greatest, I have the goggles 2 and O3 air unit If there is obstacles in the way 200m of range is pretty normal,  you won't be getting kilometers of range if you aren't directly looking at the quad in open air with literally nothing in the way and flying up at an angle (which is called lr and you shouldn't do it as a beginner) I cant get these batteries in there. It's the radiomaster pocket Well, assuming it's an 18650 flat head battery, (check the polarity, wouldn't want to fry your new radio) all you need to do is to push it a bit harder, tho if it's a 21700, well, you are out of luck Goodness yeah good thing you didn't put it in. The little + and - on the battery, there should be a + and - on the compartment as well, and you have to like them up, cause the radio won't like reverse polarity"
oh that. i put like this right?. the batteries and just a bit big for the socket. which is wierd,if i push it in i think it would break the plastic. yeah Then just push them in a bit harder
its in korean. is that okay?. cus i live in korea,Google translate exist so yeah
why?. that doest work?,You can still shorten the spring If it really has a protection circuit then that's a bit harder to remove
oh great. bruh. WHAT DO I DO?. help,You can either buy new batteries or snip a bit off the spring
which batteries do i have to buy?. does snapping a bit of the spring going to work?,Flat top non protected 18650 batteries. Ideally from samsung damn controller companies need to be more like welcoming of batteries or provide some
Why would I recommend it otherwise ? But beware that if you do you won't be able to use flat top non protected cells anymore and will be stuck with these,I had to shave some plastic off in order to close my backplate
can i go with the snapping off the bit of the spring?,Or we can all exclusively buy some vtc6 cells
Since you repeat your question I will repeat my answer > Why would I recommend it otherwise ? But beware that if you do you won't be able to use flat top non protected cells anymore and will be stuck with these. Tho just buying new batteries is the smarter solution,these batteries aren't actually 18650 so like... okay thanks! ill try buying the new batteries @Scotch :crown: You could still try to modify the batteries
how do i do that>????,"You have to remove the outer (pink)wrapping and see what they look like underneath Well usually we think really hard about where we stand and where we are going to fly and try to minimize the obstacles in the way, usually we do stand in a way that the quad is in line of sight, it's just LR 101 you never want stuff in-between you and the quad, or you can just go closer to the place you want to film but then i cant return these so they gotta work Just don't have anything metallic touching the casing and the + thingy, or else you will have a bad day Ah, well, up to you then... Returning and getting unprotected flat tops is probably a better idea li ions are cool I need to look into them more"

It just poops out 5V or a negotiated higher voltage, with a set current limit, and let's the other side do whatever with it.  It's the other side that contains the actual battery charger.. In your case, it's the battery itself that contains the battery charging circuitry.   That circuitry convers the USB power into a form that can be pushed into the lithium battery cell.  When it comes to charging safety, you're entirely at the mercy of the battery.. @kibbet5 does this make at least some sense? :grinning_face_with_sweat:","yea. it makes sense. so its just a converter i guess. instead of outputting my house's entire voltage. so i just need to know if the battery ahs protection circuit. i mean it has a light that indicates full charge. red light is charging. and at green light its full The battery has its own charging circuit, definitely, but who knows how good it is. Most of them are alright. so should i be alright You're probably the first person to understand this explanation on first try lmao. Well, what's left is the quality of the battery itself :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. It's probably not going to blow up. i need your opinion this config : APEX EVO 1x Apex EVO 5"" base frame kit 1x FC Argus F722 AxisFlying 4x AxisFlying C246 motor - 1850KV - solderless 1x Argus 55A AxisFlying ESC 1x Walksnail Avatar HD V2 Dual Antenna 1x Crossfire Nano Rx SE - solderless 1x Matek M10Q 5883 GPS - solderless 1x HQ S5 propeller set  or where is Drone : Nazgul DC5 O3 6S HD so like. the charger being 5V isnt an issue if the protective circuit is ""good"" right No, that's what the charging circuitry is for (in your case that circuitry is in the battery itself).  USB is always 5V by default.. It can switch to a different voltage if the device requests, but the device must handle 5V to get to that point.. If it has a real USB port, it must handle 5V. yea. the battery looks ok. its not a ""naked"" lipo per se. it has like a plastic black case. and some circuitry i think. i see like a green chip Either send a picture or a link to the exact thing you bought please the camera is a lie and i knew it when buying xd. it just upsacles the image to like 7000x3000 and calls it 4K. on amazon Ugh it's one of *these* yeah i know lol. but i just want to know about  you know. my house not. blowing up"
"It came with a USB cable for the batteries, right?","yea its just a generic micro usb Then yea, just use a normal power brick like you'd use to charge your phone okay thanks. can i replace the micro usb with a longer one because this one's quite short. i don't think the cable matters much honestly It doesn't matter. You're probably better off using a higher quality cable lol yea i had one. it is actually came with an old samsung phoen. ive had it charging for like 40 minutes and its not even slightly warm. more like room temperature. good sign i guess"
Can I charge a 4s battery with 1.0 A??. I've been charging them on 0.8 A for like 2 years,"No idea. The charging current depends on the capacity It's a 850mah battery k. But is it safe to charge them at 1.0 Cuz I need faster charging times. like really If you really want to speed it up, go up to like 1.7A Charge them at 30A for maximum efficiency don't do that actually nto a good idea sounds like kaboom. k. Will that decrease the battery life tho Charging at 1A vs 0.8A will only drop your ideal charge time from 60 minutes to 48 minutes"
So 1.7 is safe?. What's the difference with 1.7,"And charging at any rate higher than 1C will decrease the battery's lifespan. The faster you charge, the more you damage it. Most good-quality batteries are not *appreciably* damaged by charging at 2C (1.7A, in this case) compared to 1C, but it does still shorten the lifespan of the battery.. 60/2C = 30 minutes. YMMV"
k charging at 30A fingers crossed. my lipo will not live to tell the tale. is a cnhl mini star a good quality battery?,"neither will you. :skull: It won't care that much to be charged at 2c i might if I get back a safe distance. oop. am hearing sirens. oop. am homeless. goddamit I'm suing you man. 4th time this week your gonna be homeless like me. damn. crazy. you really have great advice, apparently Does someone here know a toturial for making your own 6s drone, wich is compatible with the radio master pocket and the ev800d. The advice is so great the court actually ruled that I get free housing for life in a protected cell with iron bars, and free food! any analog fpv drone is compatible with an ev800d. dayumn. sounds good great place for introverts"
Is the radio master pocket elrs?,I dont know really much yet about the differences between the versions ah. I think it is elrs tho. There are some tutorials. I personally recommend to get a mini whoop if it's your first drone. Like a mob 8 Or better a crux 35. Elrs version of course. So it's compatible with your radio Np. I recvomend you reading the oscar liang website. it's really helpful @Данієль. https://oscarliang.com/. Really great website Also DONT BUY a fpv starter kit. it's gonna be shitty. no matter the reviews Also read this https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1262885993778905098
Why i can only Choose Max 250mW?. The Pro Version should have 1000mW? Or im wrong?,nope. 250mw is all you get
crsf right?. probably far enough to where youd loose video,yes crossfire. Maybe I'll keep my TBS Mambo Ethix with Crossfire module after all
i dont imagine the fc being upside down or backwards tho because its a prebuilt. ?. ohhh. i had a stroke reading that,how do i arm my drone without it trying to autobalance and then it just fucking tilts itself over https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146 tysm. i think its the motor direction then Just try them all until it works Often people put the props out with props in enabled in BF It's about the direction of the props. Out is (quad pointing up) CCW CW CW CCW. In is CW CCW CCW CW
any recommendations for if to use throttle expo for indoors on a 2s whoop? to help have more control?,"Well, it's props out. So now I also need to see how your props are put on. That elrs antenna is not going to live a very long life. I mean, a 2s whoop is going to be pretty hard to freestyle indoors, with or without throttle expo because without throttle expo it's going to jump to the ceiling at 50% throttle, and with it it won't be able to catch his weight super well its kinda hard to show with transluscent props Yeah, well, from the top down. I don't have X-ray vision at a distance, I can't see the two other props. Put prop blue on prop purple and vise versa. Also, you are going to have to check the motor direction in betaflight. With the props off. Or you won't have fingers anymore (from experience). (some donut props tried to declare their independence) when i got my drone to finally arm last night. i showed my dad. and he asked why i didnt have props on :skull: ""*cuz I like having fingers*"" i said ""so it doesnt fly into the fucking ceiling and take my computer with it"""
Why should i do that?,"more range, more penetration, cheaper, more frequent updates, more modern. (its open source) You can fly behind more obstacles while loosing less data New design didnt work. Thundercunted into the floor because elrs caught on the props, cut both the straps and unloaded the battery. This all took place about 500 ft in the air. Yea... I just dont know where to put it My Full Setup is based on crossfire okay i got the prop order and motor directions fixed. will go test I'd recommend doing it like this @The GGManiack make the video if your antenna has a cutout like this, you can use one ziptie @The GGManiack reminded u Ahh good idea, are you sure the props wont like bend in flight and catch it tho"
Do you think Radiomaster is releasing a new radio anytime soon? I am thinking about upgrading my boxer with CNC Parts and AG01 gimbals :thinking_face:,if anything a zorro or a tx12 replacement. but I wouldn't count on it hmh okey...I would love the boxer with a coloured touchscreen :derp:
"ok this might be a dumb question but are crossfire and elrs the same? Because I use elrs and I have for a while but when I looked in “internal RF” on my tx16s, it’s set to CRSF which i assume is crossfire?. Also when I go to the info tab it says my internal module is CRSF even though I’m pretty sure I bought it with ELRS built in. So are ELRS and Crossfire the same? Or is CRSF just another name for ELRS???","Yeah that's called a tx16s That one is a lil to big :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: CRSF is nothing more than how the receiver connects to the board,  it's like USB, a USB mouse ain't the same as a USB keyboard even if they both use USB But no, elrs and crossfire are very different in how they worl. It's just called CRSF cause it was designed for Crossfire at the beginning Ohhhhhhh ok that makes sense. yeah I thought they were different but then I saw that and was confused you said last night i had my board chosen wrong..."
"I think I've got everything, am I good to checkout?","Are there any headsets that can be used as a display for fpv sims any headset with an HDMI input should be able to work with a sim Crossfire is a radio link system from TBS that first implemented the CRSF wire communication protocol for communication between the radio handset and transmitter module, and the receiver and FC.  Since then, CRSF as the wire protocol has been used in other systems, like Tracer from TBS, and now ELRS. kinda like every car uses CAN to communicate between its electronics, but not every car using CAN is the same assuming you already have goggles and a charger, everything looks good"
"Why not just using a battery that fit tho ?. https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/2s-450mah-80c-gnb-lihv-battery-xt30-by-gaoneng-12368.html like that one. Which I used on my mob8, it's a very good pack","Assuming you don't want batteries that fit it will be good Cause the 660mah is 17.5 x 18mm, and the mob8 battery tray is 13x18mm I read that, I plan on cutting the tray and replacing it with a rubber band cause I want some small ones for shorter freestyle flights, and a couple bigger just cruiser ones for more flight time"
"Why not get some 450mah and 550mah and not have to chop up the frame ?. And on my 450mah on my 2"" 2s with about the same components as a mob8 I get like 4-5min of freestyle, so 7-8min of cruising shouldn't be hard to achieve on the same batteries","I mainly just wanna try it out and test, I find that the most fun part about having a drone imo, aside from just flying. I mean, I guess, but there is a difference between testing and getting something you know is worse but getting it anyway. Also, here, these are higher capacity and should fit pretty tightly, tho they are garbage for freestyle https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/explorer-750mah-hv-2s-80c-lipo-battery-2pcs-by-flywoo-10896.html. So you won't have to chop up the frame and have the smaller capacity not fit tightly anymore"
Jst connectors are used on battery chargers hota d6 pro?,"Yup, some jst-xh for the balance plug. The discharge lead is an amass xt60"
Uhm them jst or jst-xh or what is for balancer?,"JST is a brand, stands for ""Japan solderless terminal"", jst-xh is the specific plug,  For exemple, the USB forum is the ""brand"", and usb-c is the connector"
But the jst-xh is used got the balancer?. For*,It shoud have small like connector things on the Side The jst-xh *is* the balance plug. Yeah that's a jst-xh 6
That is used on balancers right?,"Idk it does seems to fit... Again, jst-xh *is* the plug we use on the balance lead The pins on charger are too low Well, that is a charger problem. The pins might be bent down a little Well the balance plug won't fit. So not really"
I am now a little confused if it fits it fits i mean. It shoud be tight?,"Oh, I thought you said ""it does*n't* seem to fit"" mb. Yeah, that's normal. Yeah it looks good"
Just wanna ask what difference is then in jst and ph2.0?,"Well, the connector is different"
Ph2.0 is for main connector? Ye,"Bruh i tought that ph2.0 is for balancer and i have jst that doesnt fit... Ph2.0 is generally used for a discharge lead, but it sucks. And jst xh is what we use for the balance plug on all our lipos"
Oh okey thanks for very much good that i dont need to buy new connectors. Btw what awg wire shoud i put into the jst-xh. I have 20 and 14 i think?. Or tiny non Silicone wires jumper wires?,"I need to do costum 2s battery. So I need a balancer A 26/28awg wire should work, tho you will need to crimp it Pliers i have at the most... For the balance lead, 18awg will work for a lipo. Yeah nah you are going to *need* a crimp or pre crimped wires"
Why. I shoud be able to do it wirh Pliers?,Cuz that's how jst plugs work. The crimp hooks into the connector. And that's how it holds. You can't just jam the wire into the connector
Pliers + some solder if it wont work i have no other option ig. So 20 awg wire?. Ye i mean ik but i will do it like twice and then wont use it so ye,"No you need a crimp. Yeah but no, cause it just won't hold into the plug I think they meant use pliers as a crimp, which you can do if you're careful I'm pretty sure he just wants to jam the wires in the connector and hope it won't short circuit"
what vtx does that drone use?,"hello guys, I wanted to build an uav fixed wing drone with a gyro camera, but never built any drone before, is there a comprehensive list or pdf showing what a drone is composed of, components etc..."
Yes. Do you know which goggles are compatible?. I answered before i read it:grinning_face_with_sweat:,"that’s ok :face_with_tears_of_joy:. Yes. If it’s that drone with the O3 video transmission system, then the DJI goggles 2 will work by the way, the DJI goggles 2 are different from the DJI goggles V2, so make sure you get the right one. But the goggles 2 (newer goggles) and the goggles V2 (a little older version) will actually both work with the O3 transmission system for that drone"
Yes okay. How do you know when the battery of the drone runs out?,"I don’t really know, I haven’t heard of that but it might be possible. someone else might know more about the feasibility of that. so your OSD in your goggles should tell you what your battery voltage on the drone is the latency will be bad so it will only really be usable for high-altitude cruising with an autopilot. ^ So basically for lipo batteries, a good max charge voltage is 4.2 volts per cell and you should probably start landing when it gets down to around 3.6v or 3.5v. So if you have a 6s (6 cell) lipo battery then you should land when it gets near to 21.6v (that’s 3.6v * 6 cells).. Hope that makes sense"
"Hello, On which websites can I find 3D models to print?","Technically, yes I believe a few companies do it do but if has very high latency and limited range making RF transmission much more preferred and effective <https://www.yeggi.com/>"
radio is saying RTC battery low. what does that mean?,"That the battery is low I want to build a budget 3.5 inch drone for a friend. Can someone please recommend me a x-frame, motors, fc/esc stack and props. Maybe a frame where walksnail moonlight fits in"
But the radios battery is full?,"The grinderino, the 1605 3800kv aerolite motors, the hq 3.5x2.5x3 and for the stack, the mk4 20x20 f405 diatone stack. (on 4s) :waving_hand:  my on-paper math says it can fit up to *possibly* ~19"" props (if my math maths correctly), but gimme a bit to get to the quad itself and do actual measurements haha. feel free to ping me if I forget to do so (since you (kinda) asked, I went to check the math and it's good) thank you, I did this math at a time when i was barely awake Hello, first time here. I hava a fpv nazgul dc5 ifligth, chainging a leg i broke a little resistance or something like that (im beginner with fpv classic drones) and i dont know what is it and how to fix it. Don't know if thats the place, but if someone con help me i will be so grateful. It is the liitle buddy just at rigth of usb-c port. Thx so much!!! That's the DFU/bootloader switch, you press it when you want to have your fc enter DFU/bootloader mode, if it isn't stuck on the on position (you can use the fc as normal) then you can just leave it like that and push on it with a screwdriver when you need to use it"
"I have a 6s LiPO (Tattu) 1400mah. The official website says I can safely discharge it to 3.5 volts per cell (21v). I displayed the draw in the OSD and by the end of the flight when there was about 21.2 - 21.1v remaining the draw was only ~900mah. I suppose 1400 mah makes sense when discharging to 3V, but wouldn't I ruin the battery then?","So, thing is, that the amp meter is *always* miss calibrated out of the box, you need to calibrate it first. You go fly some packs, note how many mah the osd tells you you have consumed, then charge them, note how much the charger said it charged it, then adjust in the betaflight battery tab Guys why do websites not list whether antena is male of female sma Every sma antennas is male, every rp-sma antenna is female, but that doesn't matter, you just need the same on both sides I see that now, weird as the graphics show both male and female for sma and for rpsma"
My quad looks a bit like this and at takeoff it will oscillate violently once it gets a few millimeters off the ground and will then come back down despite being at full throttle. I’m assuming those oscillations though are due to incorrect arducopter pid tunings?. Yes ik I still got some cleanup to do and heat shrink to shrink,"is there another frame because this one is out of stock Well, that's really the best one imo, but you also have the vx3.5 that's very good"
can could i use 1507 or 1606 motors?. the one you mentioned is also not available,I would recommend you use 1604 or 1804 instead
okay. how much kv should it at least have and maximum kv?,"3500kv is about the minimum for 4s, and 4000kv about the maximum with a sweet spot at 3800kv"
okay thx. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) these ones right? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/hqprop-t35x2x3-2cw2ccw-pc-7931.html,"They will work even if I recommended the 2.5 pitch version if i get these ones https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/p1604-35-freestyle-sub-3800kv-motor-by-t-motor-10059.html do i need to get mounting screw or does it come with every motor. I don't mean the screw that attaches the motors to the frame, but the thing you screw on top of the props to hold them in place. It comes with the T mount screws No. That's a T mount motor&prop it doesnt seem to come with this It doesn't use an m5 shaft which ones do i need for that motor You screw the prop into the motor. With 2 screws. And it comes with them"
ohhhh. thanks. BLHeli_S?. or BL32 better,"is there a budget stack with am32 It doesn't mean you can't use it anymore. A lot of the skystar esc has am32 it can't be updated. if the ESC comes with a dud version, you're SOL I never updated my esc firmware"
Hello I have a question and that is when I make a quick shot with my mini 4 pro it is not in log can you set that somehow?,What can I do To get rid of this lipo just crashed my drone :grinning_face_with_sweat: @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) is 35A enough for 3.5 inch 4S Simply put adhesive tape around it and it will work again I did it the same way
battery looks a little bit puffed no?,"If only a bit of the cover is off then it works and slightly dented too maybe try charging it and see what the IR is. for that cell if you can figure out which it is But if the battery is damaged in any way, you'd better throw it away"
So I should just not use it right?,better safe than sorry should i use the RP4TD receiver or is there a better one rather replace a $30 lipo than replace your burnt down house right :face_with_tears_of_joy: Yeah that's what I'm telling myself Better just throw it away probably better to discharge to zero first
Have you unloaded it dead ?,so that it doesn’t create a 600 degree fire in the garbage man’s truck. sorry we should’ve said that before hand :loudly_crying_face: does your charger have a “destroy” function Yeah It's called: shorting the shit out of it :face_with_tears_of_joy: ok well maybe just completely discharge the battery then is Walksnail Avatar HD Pro compatible with the new Walksnail Googles L
"Hey guys, does it matter which end of dji or3 air unit cable you plug into fc and unit or no?",they're cheap but limited. Also the protocol is too short range for what you want with drones. I recommend a EdgeTX radio with ELRS. Radiomaster and Jumper sell them.
"i have no idea what that means, protocol?. also how limited","the way it sends the radio signal. fly behind a tree and lose signal limited oh, this is more so a multi use esc, want it for a single prop project, for a ebicycle, and for an rc car, like modular plug and play system so i dont need multiple controlers"
"also all the latest firmware is designed for use with ELRS and edgetx. yes, and?","so might be most suitable, was thinking Flipsky 75100 to be exact, as for RC id plan to use an extra thingy to have more range, not that i plan to fly it more than 500m, on open fields/above water FlipSky and FlySky are different brands"
Should I use XT30 or XT60 for 850mAh 4S 3.5 inch build. and is 850mAh good?,"oh then i meant flipsky sorry im not up to date with all this stuff ""flypsky"" here resembles a typo of ""flysky"" more than it it resembles ""flipsky"", that's where what @Sea_Kerman said comes from oh well, then uhh exactly what i said but for flipsky :DIWhy: I'm unsure how you're supposed to control it then. usually rc recievers output PWM or dshot or sbus or crsf its justm the esc part, the rest will be external like the controling it par. first i want a controler that works to be multi use case, and then to figure out how to make it rc in a responsive way seems like it would be heavy for a plane, with the all metaql case, and being made for bicycles. also you'd likely have to either make a custom elrs fork to make an elrs reciever speak... wait, it can understand ppm its only 300 grams total I assume that @Naz. That Guy only wants to know if Flipsky ESCs are any good. nothing about the radio link matters atm yeah. it's a bit of a ""sir, this is a wendy's"" moment because this is a server about rc aircraft. though probably a few of us here do ebike stuff too yeah weight isnt rly an issue, radio link doesnt matter im probs gonna end up only having throtle, nose up and down, and side to side control for the *plane*. and thats easy to do with even an rc car radio anyway, I have no idea about the quality"
"i see. but it should work for all projects?. spec wise it seems legit. and every one is recomending me it. btw what about weight? i thought planes were less so crazy abt weight, wanted to make something that i can have a smoke flare or two on it, and fly it around drawing in the air. so if 300 grams with an alu shell rly is heavy, i think i might have to re think my plane idea","actually it seems ok compared to the competition. (the weight) yeah they are pretty compact, and used also for em light thin electric longboards so seems kinda perfect for a multi use bldc esc thats light and versetile anyway you'll need one of these to get it to talk to a regular RC reciever https://www.amazon.com/QWinOut-Performance-Convertor-Interchang-Multirotor/dp/B0999F7SFX. as for the reciever, the ER4 or ER6 from radiomaster should suit your uses The RP4TD is about as good as it gets, you also have the SuperD from betafpv that competes with it, but personally I trust radiomaster more"
okay and 850mAh is good?https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/tattu-4s-850mah-75c-lipo-battery-xt30-1158.html,"Yup, 850mah and 650mah 4s are kind of the standard sizes"
should I get the GEP-TAKER G4 AIO instead of a stack?,https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/f405-mini-bls-35a-20x20-stack-by-speedybee-11613.html  or  https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/mamba-mk4-f405-mini-f40bls-mini-stack-by-diatone-11941.html   the speedybee is way cheaper
is 6s better for 3.5 inch?,"The batteries cost more but you get the same benefits as you would on a 5"". less sag and the like"
should I get these motors then? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/p1604-35-freestyle-sub-2850kv-motor-by-t-motor-10058.html,those should be okay yeah if you want those
are there better and cheaper options? if yes then ill use that,Those are probably as cheap as it gets honestly. mine were like. 21 dollars a piece and it hurts to think about
so this would be scam on aliexpress? https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006328256177.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.531738dakSik2F&mp=1&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu. 40€ for 4 pcs,possibly. check the seller reviews. and see how long they've been in business yeah it was scam. it says this but only 18 followers check the negative reviews mainly
Anyone know if the 2s balance lead plug on some of the transmitters if I can just use the end 2 and put full 2s voltage through it? Or do I need the middle one,"You can use the balance plug for power, as long as you only need a small amount of power Sorry, bad explanation, so the radio master Zorro you can power with an external battery but the plug is a 2s balance plug"
"So could I just not use the middle one and do like a balance plug to xt30?. No, I have a really shitty pucture. Like this","Oh, yea you could. There's a good chance the middle pin isn't connected to anything anyway Ok awesome, I might pop it apart and double check but I'm also a little hesitant and concerned pieces will fall out of place They shouldn't, just go slowly"
Random question. If.the balance leads in a freak accident whilst on the move were able to touch + and - on another balance lead would it go kapow?,"unlikely, they'd have to touch in a specific way Just trying to do as much prep for my flight eith drones as possible energy has to flow, it accidentally touching one wire to another battery shouldn't do much. and balance connectors are designed so it can't happen Perfect thank you. Might get  some balance lead caps printed off just to ensure leads are all covered. Give airport security 0 to moan about"
can a soldering iron be powered with a 20w wall charger? pretty sure its 12v output. like the pinecil for example? it has usb c so i was wondering can i run it off a 20w 12v wall charger. if not its fine i have a 100w macbook one i can steal from my parents. i mean borrow,"no the official minimum recommended is 65W. 45W works too for smaller stuff oh kk. this wont be too much right too much wattage doesn't exist. too much voltage does. but the Pinecil supports the full USB-PD spec obviously i need to learn what all this shit means bru. its been too long not knowing the diff between wattage and voltage wattage = amperage * voltage kk. and voltage is like, ok bear with me for the stupid ass comparison. but volts is like how much the gas tank is full not really. I shall employ the hydraulic analogy. voltage is the water pressure. current is the volume of water flowing per second. from this, ohm's law naturally follows this makes some amount of sense for a given pipe diameter (resistance), more pressure (voltage) will push more water through per second im so excited to have an actual  good iron. goodbye 10$ blue amazon iron that blew up in slowfoods hands but a specific device, at the right pressure, will only draw as much current as it wants. Just because a water tower can discharge hundreds of gallons per second doesn't mean that opening a single tap on the entire water network will flow hundreds of gallons per second this is a really good analogy this shit is actually starting to make sense"
"How much heat from soldering can ESC boards tolerate? When tinning battery pads and motor pads, I had the soldering iron in contact with each pad for about 2-3 seconds at 400° C and that made the heat sink of the ESC board heat up to the point that I couldn't touch it (~80° C). Hope I didn't fry anything!","You're okay, factory solder melts at a way higher point than your hopefully 63/37 solder does."
Can u post a close up of the motor pads of the esc?. As well as of the power cables/XT60 pad,Not the best solder job. But I tested the strength of each of them
At which temp are soldering?,How do u proceed from just unpacked ESC to this state. Each single step. In terms of soldering. Not mounting etc First I soldered the xt60 and capacitor. Then each motor.
Fahrenheit or celsius?,"Ok i might not have been clear enough. I was talking EACH single step Ok I followed a video series. Let me post it I dont want to watch videos. I want to know what u have done I solder at 320-360. 400 is way too high First, I assembled the frame. Then, I took the ESC board, soldered the negative terminal, the positive terminal, and the capacitor onto it. After that, I installed the ESC board onto the frame. Then, I installed the motors on the frame, routed the wires underneath the ESC, and soldered each wire onto the ESC pads. This also doesnt make much sense because the plus and minus of the capacitor can still touch and cause a short That will be taken care of"
Did u put solder onto the wires BEFORE soldering them to the motor pads?,"Ok :OK_hand_light_skin_tone: I followed the process of tinning and then soldering.. Used flux as required. Also there should only be so much bare wire visible as the solder pad itself needs Yes. Need to do some corrections. But the current joints are strong. And I saw motor4 also moving while powering up They definitely do not have been applied with solder before. I can literally see each strain Proud or not doesnt matter. U didnt apply solder to the wires before soldering them onto the pad It came pre tinned. Before soldiering it on to the big pad, I melted the tinned tip really well, and then soldered it on. At least on the picture it doesnt look like they are It was literally soaked in melted solder I would fix all motor wires. Clean the pads/remove solder. Shorten the exposed wires. Pretin them. Pretin the pads with flux. Solder the motor wires onto them. But not with 400C. Try 330 or 320 As a process I did all these. I think my soldering iron wasn't at 400 C even tho the dial was on 400 Look up a bunch of soldering tutorials. Then fix yours"
I'll get liquid insulation coating  and apply on the exposed portions of the power input wires and cap.. I think most people solder the thick wires onto bigger pads using 400C or just above. Tip is also important. This is what I learned. 320 deg C is a little low for soldering a 12AWG don't you think?,Depends on if u have lead in your solder or not
what should i do if getfpv donest want or cant to deliver my stuff?. i have tried banggood too,"idk. i order, wait 6 months and get a notification that my stuff wont come"
so why are you ordering from the US??????????,"idk they have all the stuff i want from one website clearly they don't since they cancelled it. Banggood should work, AliExpress should work and then there's <https://fpvmarket.eu/>. drone-fpv-racer and rotorama being big ones after 6 months is crazy tho pretty classic for GetFPV actually. just another part of why GetFPV is hated it was banggood. but probably if i wouldnt cancel my order i would wait another 6 months what did you order. because I'm sus it's something awful at this point radiomaster pocket, skyzone x, vifly whoopstor, everything. props"
was anything out of stock?,nah. i am not even able to explain what i needed to do to even get the order accepted from getfpv and i didnt even get it I ordered something from get fpv waited months then emailed to check status and was told I was refunded. Never knew and was never told till I emailed don't order from US stores either way. you're wasting your money purchasing from the US instead of in Europe or CN... i think ill just get the cetus x that's an even bigger waste of money... dude just buy from a european store. it'll arrive within the week but i dont wanna buy my things from 4 seperate websites
you don't have to. stop being like this :loudly_crying_face:. and look at what I've written to you before. come the hell on. <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/meteor75-brushless-whoop-version-2022-elrs-24g-betafpv-10892.html> <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/radio-pocket-elrs-24g-radiomaster-11580.html#/2991-couleur-transparent> <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/whoopstor-3-vifly-11436.html> <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/recherche?controller=search&s=18650> <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/lunettes-fpv-cobra-x-v4-skyzone-9396.html>. wow lookie there. all in stock on one website. and not overpriced!. those are pretty much lower prices than you'd probably be having to pay importing from the US. so,they have everything i want except 2 things
how fast do they restock?,"depends on if they expected it to sell out. faster than 6 months though lol let me take a look real quick. a bt2.0 connector <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/batterie-lipo-1s-450mah-100c-hv-bt20-dogcom-10099.html> meteor75 comes with a bt2.0, I don't know what tinywhoop you were getting though i have a tinywhoop. banggood only gave me the drone rip. they have bt2 connectors and a30, both of which should work. you could also return the drone to banggood and it'd probably save you money sfia6b for my plane. ill survive without that. nah ill keep it"

hlo hlo. anyone pls. tell me how to swarm drone. is their any tutorial available in internet??,"I just tested out RushFPV M10 Micro. Tiny tiny chip. Worked well, acquired 3D fix in 2 minutes for the very first time. Subsequent fixes only took few seconds.. Need to modify the mount design. Put the gps at the front of the quad, above the camera/on the GoPro if you have a gopro. It will give much better reception I had it at the front of my previous build. You're right. I'll move this to the front, if it has issues being near VTX ok ive ordered the walksnail m10 gps but it is taking forever to ship im gonne see how it performs If you have an aio with some big pads like the f4 5a 1s I would say you can leave the aio inside the frame, it's pretty trivial to solder on it from there, probably another story if you use something like the x12 with it's minuscule pads. A gps has issues being near *any* TX, may it be the vtx or the receiver, it will always work better if it's far away from sources of RF yep. I've also seen that putting 2-3 layers of anti-static sheets below the chip usually helps. The anti-static sheets absorbs RF All m10 gps are essentially the same with a different sticker, so it should perform basically the same doesn't reflect like the metal surfaces do its the superX elrs from the mob6 2024 Yeah it has some fairly large pads, it shouldn't be an issue but in Oscar Liangs tests some m10 gps were worse than others https://oscarliang.com/gps-review/ The variation is of +- 1 sattelite from 15, except for the 2 12, that were from some nano/mini gps which are bound to be a bit less performant 15 12 14 16 12 16 I just saw 25 sats with the micro M10 on bench. Need to see how it performs during a flight Yeah 25 sats is pretty normal yea there isnt that big of a difference But then it  is not the sats, but the DOP values. which are important, I guess. Positional DOP"
What is the best ELRS Controller at the Moment? Compared to a Crossfire TBs Tango 2?,"literally anything from radiomaster or jumper is better than that thing. it can't even run ELRS on full speed, it runs a proprietary fork of opentx, it's just bad all over"
Radiomaster Zorro Maybe?. I Like the small Version of a Controller,"probably a Boxer or a Jumper T15/T20 you have pocket instead Boxer, T15, Tango, Zorro are all the same size. Pocket and T20 are small I don’t want a Big Controller. I have at the Moment a TBS Mambo and i want Maybe Switch to ELRS if there is a small Controller with Big power"
"looking at the toolkitrc c6 50w charger, any thoughts?","I would highly recommend going with a 2 channel charger. I got a one channel charger at first, and I already upgraded to a 2 channel just a question why did you upgrade, wanted batteries to charge faster or just for convenience oop one more question for a plug and play drone do i need to solder the elrs module on, was looking at the nazgul eco, from a German website and just saw it was pnp Yup, pnp means no receiver. The only reason why you get a dual channel charger is to charge all your batteries faster, since you can't charge lipos at more than 2c, the only way to have all your packs charged faster is to charge multiple at a time yea im not too rushed about the charging, im not going be flying every day. oop gotta change drone then Yeah but being able to charge your packs faster is very convinent, even if you fly only once a week. Or learn to solder, you will have to solder stuff at some point anyway was kinda hoping to start already in germany, would have to wait for Mauritius to get stuff for soldering Trying to flash my rm zorro internal elrs module how long roughly does a 6s take to charge You should charge all your batteries between 1 and 2c, so from empty to full in 1h to 30min Until you get 8+ packs for now just will be 2 and maybe one for the goggles. depending on the goggles Well, take into account that you won't be flying for longer than 5min if you freestyle your quad Hi, what lipo should I buy (4s) for a crux 35. I alr have two 850 ministars but they weigh a ton. also im in poland so no rdq. or other cool us shops Some 650mah 4s ministar or some 850mah 4s gnb flower, they weight the same Or some 650mah 4s gnb flower k. I'll take a 650 ministar. thanks Was just checking the airlines rules, from what I can see I can only take about 100wh of batteries. So that's roughly 3 6s batteries Yeah, airline rules are annoying, but it depends on which airline you take Personally when I go on vacation I just ship my lipos to myself. It's the kinda loophole to bring more lipos with you"

bro what size is your 6s?. like a 1500mah is what 6Wh?. oh damn. times 6. yep. makes more sense,"I am flying with friends so ima just put lipos in their bag as well ahaha. i wish i had that ,. came here alone bro 100wh is so little yea it is, i just dont know if its for all the batteries or for 1 they dont state good thing I have people to frame for smuggling. that depends on the airline. the general rule is under 100Wh general but airlines normally limit you to like 2 lipos per person Well, you go on the configurator (assuming you have the right firmware) connect like with betaflight (betaflight has to be closed, and you need a chromium browser, like chrome), then on the first page you will have some sliders (obviously you were smart and removed the props) the sliders lets you turn the motors, note which esc (which slider, note the number) turns in the wrong direction, then go to read settings, select ""reversed"" for the escs that spin in the wrong direction, then ""write settings"" and voila that's it. Ime it's usually ""you can take N batteries so long as the batteries are under 100wh each"" maybe i can take more, was reading over it again, just says for batteries over 100wh you need to let them know and get approval, but nothing about numbwer oh I misread it. I was thinking you said you can take as much as you want as long as each of them is under 100Wh. btw this is on my lipo bag No, N is just here as a placeholder for whatever number the airline allows yep annoying really. like wtf you mean ONLY 2 Also iata only allows you to bring 20 sub 100wh battery, so I'm not sure what's up with this bag"
"where do you get lipo bags, do you have to buy them yourself or do you get them from the airline?","You buy them, a few fpv stores sell some like tbs or rotorama yea i am buying from the german rotorama website I got mine from pyrodrone how many do those small ""pouches"" fit like I am pretty sure you don't NEED one. check the size chart. mine very comfortably fits 4, and you can prob put like 8-10 in there if you really wanted yea they dont have a size chart that i can see"

Keep it stock The original one is fine until it breaks, then I would recommend you get a pigtail and a truerc matchstick with a 3d printed holder for the pigtail, it will be a lot more durable, perform a touch better and there won't be any possibility for the antenna coming loose and breaking off the ufl/mmcx Other than that... Flyfish Osprey, rush cherry 2, TrueRC Core/OCP Ok. You got a file for the holder No but it should be fairly easy to find on printables or thingiverse, or you could design one yourself, it's fairly easy and you will learn a bit of CAD which is a very useful skill to have.

can you solder?. what cell count is it?,"anyone from  the uk know how to get rid of liops i cant discharge it and the data cable has been chopped off by my props the other thing you plug into the charger anyway, can you solder, and what cell count is it just dont know what to do and its sparking like crazy when i touch it yeah don't do that lol Insulate every wire that's hanging free It might still be saveable no i am happy to get rid of it you haven't answered my questions https://youtu.be/5wbLEwuMy3I I again ask what is the cell count https://pyrodrone.com/products/zero-volt-lipo-killer-xt60-and-xt30-connectors. or you can make your own Or you can fix the balance plug with 2 12v incandecent bulbs in series. or of course fix it Or you can smash it with a hammer, it's very fun to do (From a safe distance, somewhere non flammable and with ventilation) ummmm. i dont know what to say about that. can i not just recycle it do you want it i am happy to send it to you for free if you pay for postage If @SKULL isn't comfortable with fixing it, don't make him do it Let's just figure out a way to safely dispose of it *hammer it* (In a safe and responsible manner) in the uk near brighton Well it will be more expensive to ship then to buy it new well i need to get rid of it So, you can just go in your backyard and hammer it. From a safe distance And do it on some concrete or something can someone give me a good option Get that and throw it away at your local recycling center. They usually have a spot for old batteries Discharge it completely first can i do it without balence Yeah. You just need to discharge it to 0v. With something like that https://pyrodrone.com/products/zero-volt-lipo-killer-xt60-and-xt30-connectors.

Where do I don’t. Do it it was just there is there anything i need to worry about. when discharging could it go boom No. If you do it properly is that what the ext discharge does. theres so many options on the charger pretty sure no. that's for hooking up a power resistor and discharging batteries faster. it might do a full discharge but if so the internal discharge woudl too. it seems the d6 pro doesn't have a destroy/kill mode i wanted to kill it tomorow Just blow it up in a safe manner i can but not really well i made one of my drones do you have spare xt60s/30s f. ok, you should probably just get a killer what if i recycle it and dont tell them if its discharged"
Do you want to burn down your local recycling center?. Cause they will throw it with a bunch of metal crap. And it very well could short circuit it and go kaboom. And they won't really be happy about it,"what electronic components do you have you can at least discharge it to like 3v/cell, then it will be mostly inert. as far as your charger will go. ah, if you tell it it's a li-ion, it might let you go down to 2 what if i leave me drone on for a long time. how long does the killer take. do you have one it will take a long time because it has no cooling. use the charger if you set it to Lixx it lets you discharge down to 1.5v ok and i dont need the other cable for that let me try. yes. it complains at you, of course. has an ""are you sure you want to do this without the balance connector"" popup. but it will work Not really. If you just discharge it you will make it less and less active. The lower the charge the less likely it will explode ok ill do that tomorrow and ill get the liop killer. how does it work You plug in the lipo. Well that's about it where does the power go heat. it's basically the simplest possible electrical circuit Or you can buy a big old inefficient brushed motor and power it, that will drain it faster. And once it stops spinning that means your battery is at 0v and with the killer how do i know when its dead stab it and if it doesnt explode its dead"
"can you guys stop being so unsafe?. ""hammer it"" ""stab it""",it says in the description that when the led stops blinking it's done. @SKULL

"Why would you want suicide arming?. It was deprecated precisely because of why it's called that. There is no safe way to have a not-immediate disarm button. When shit goes wrong in a way that requires you to disarm, you disarm right then and there, not in 2 seconds","What is the diffrence between blheli and blheli suit BLHeli is what runs in the ESC itself - the ESC's firmware BLHeli Suite is what's used to configure an ESC running BLHeli. nowadays, specifically, it's BLHeli_S or BLHeli_32. with BLHeliSuite16 for BLHeli_S ESCs and BLHeliSuite32 for BLHeli_32 ESCs. *however*. 1) BLHeli_32 is dead, it was a proprietary closed-source firmware with online verification and the company had to close down. 2) When dealing with a BLHeli_S ESC, unless you need to recover a soft-bricked ESC, instead of BLHeliSuite, use https://esc-configurator.com it's a way more intuitive ESC configurator. 3) most people don't run BLHeli_S on BLHeli_S compatible ESCs nowadays, but an alternative firmware, like BlueJay, which has some more modern goodies. my writing skills are 0 today :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: BLHeli config and esc config .com is the exact same. Thank you :saluting_face: no. BLHeli Configurator is a predecessor of esc-configurator.com. and BLHeli Suite is the original software"
But how do I get to do that I keep getting desync or will I have less desyncing problems with bluejay?,"So, you're trying to fix a desync issue. Desync is not usually caused by ESC Configuration. usually it's the motor or ESC that's bad. sometimes the wiring may be at fault. RPM Power Protection (Rampup) is a setting that matches BLHeli_S's ""startup power"""
"There is no ""specific value that prevents desyncs"", you have to adjust values and figure out what helps. it desyncs during full throttle?. or when dropping from full throttle?. or when going to full throttle?",Yeah maybe i don't have loggs You can try to increase the timing and reduce the Rampup
How do I get blackbox files does it automaticly go on the SD card in the FC?,"if the FC has a SD card, is capable of writing to it, and Blackbox is enabled, then yes, they will be on the SD card.. anyway Personally, I would reduce Rampup power  (down from 9x) and increase Timing, if I was trying to fix desyncs"
Is there some criterion by which to choose a good patch antenna?,"VAS is a company, and they suck, don't buy from them, the owner is a transphobic cunt -- A patch is a type of antenna, it can be an omni or a directional, but the term ""patch"" is often used to describe any directional antenna even if multiple types of directional antennas exist (such as patches, helicals, crosshairs etc) Antenna gain. Big number =  good :thumbs_up: Well, anything from truerc is good If you want to go check the actual specifications, then check the efficiency, you want it to be at like 90+%, anything significantly lower isn't very good, check the swr, you want it to be low, (1:1 being perfect, 3:1 being extremely bad) then you have the gain, more gain = more range = smaller beam width, so it depends on the use case, if they include a diagram where you can see the beam (linked an exemple underneath, from the x²-air, very good antenna) you want to make sure it's nice and smooth without any spikes, and essentially what this diagram tells you is like where it gets more range if you were standing at the middle and facing up, so you can also analyze that if you want, the bandwidth can essentially be ignored since all antennas will be good enough there, then you can check the beam width to see if it's right for your use case  Or you can just ask here and we will tell you which are good. Also, I forgot to add but the left one is viewed from the top, the right one is from the side. Some even include a 3d view. Also, as an exemple, let's imagine this is the top down view, it basically tells you that you will get lots of range in front of you, and minimal range on the sides because the side lobes don't go super far, same thing with the back. And swr is basically a ratio of how much power gets reflected back into the TX/how much goes out for how much you put in, in other words it's [power sent into the antenna]:[power radiated by the antenna]. Also forgot that I dont want to do that really. I want a quick disarming option if I decide to do that consciously. but I want to also prevent accidental disarming, that means my fingers accidentally putting enough pressure on a switch, not the case of a switch being mistaken for another.. I will use a push button. The only (slight) disadvantage is that it can't be operated with the same degree of easiness while landing & disarming"
Is this antenna bundle good (for analog goggles)? https://www.getfpv.com/lumenier-axii-2-diversity-antenna-bundle-5-8ghz-rhcp.html,"It's... okay. what is your budget I wouldn't get it, I would get a prodrone miCross/truerc x-air (depending on availability where you live) or a truerc x²-air if budget allows, and a truerc singularity. I mean, it will work, just not great"
Is it possible to flash INAV to a HakRC F722d ??,"The patch is designed by TrueRC. Not entirely sure abt the omni, but it'd also pretty good I know. but like, you can get a lot better I'm 90% sure all AXII omnis are also designed by TrueRC. At the very least, TrueRC is specifically cited on this one: https://pyrodrone.com/products/lumenier-axii-2-long-range-5-8ghz-antenna-rhcp. It's good. Not the very very best, and expensive for what you get, but good. Ideally though, you should not put such a short omni antenna on your goggles, IMO To expand on what Daedalus said, you want a nice and long Omni so it ends up above your head so the signal doesn't get blocked by your brain juices when you fly behind yourself"
"Indeed, the human brain is a big bucket of water and ~~absorbs lots of radiation~~ blocks of your FPV signal when it's in the way. You mean *this* HAKRCKD722 target?. It sure seems like it",Which is the exact reason why stubbies are dumb

so there is no advantage to them anymore?,"for freestyle, definitely not. for ultralight and/or small builds, it is still okay and used, but in a much more refined manner i see. thank you for the help FYI - the second frame (the single piece one) has some major structural flaws. The top plate will cave in upon the slightest impact (lacks support in the mid-read). and the bottom plate will crack around the arm corners (where they meet the midframe).

Ima flash back to 4.:. 4.3. Then install new dump Emilia , yea so im not seeing any bind button in beta flight"
why would there be a bind button in betaflight?. flash the receiver with a bind phrase,"no. only for spi receivers. which suck, and you don't have one https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases/download/v1.7.2/ExpressLRS-Configurator-Setup-1.7.2.exe"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) do you know how to bind the darwin foldape4  to the tx16s?,well what is it. are they elrs yeah. i believe so. https://pyrodrone.com/products/darwinfpv-foldape4-4-folding-long-range-analog-bnf-fpv-drone-elrs-2-4g <https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/binding/> i couldint find the protocol for the drone on the transmitter. i also dont know exactly what protocol it is but i tried looking up the erciver and matching anything i could find and nothing matched.
"looks like ""pick a race frame"" + camera pod?",Definitely custom made. Hence all the colors of tpu and such
But like I see so many creators with this drone. Do they follow a step by step tutorial?,Almost everyone uses the same frame for racing or a select few different frames. Then these frame all have the same design for camera mount. And antenna mount and such. So it’s basically copy and paste
Where are you able to buy all the parts from?,Kinda depends I mean people buy from different stores but just depends where ur located and what’s ins rock. Stock. I’m actually building 4 race drones rn
What mother do you have on that?. Motors*. Lol,Mck 2100kv rcingpower gts v4. although all my parts are on the high end fs. $28 per motor lol. dropped like 3k on my race setup but obviously it’s an insane not usual practice
How much would it cost to build a freestyle drone?. Like at the most affordable but still good,currently you probably won't get below the price of a prebuilt nazgul eco. or maybe right onto the price..
Antennas. mount v. ?. Literally just antennas,Yea well those are just antennas. the antenna mount is what holds them in place
Why is there 2 tho. Are they separate or are they in 1 peice?,"They are separate. Just gives better range and penetration I guess. if u can have 1 why not 2 Lol thx. :PepeHammer: In Analog video systems, there is a single antenna, because the VTX only blindly transmits. There would be no advantage from 2 antennas, only disadvantages due to signal rejection issues.  In Digital systems, the VTX typically runs a bi-directional form of communication, for which 2 antennas are advantageous (can transmit and receive at the same time, can receive from 2 different angles, etc) Ye. @The GGManiack knows that already lol"
did you set one? (on your radio),"i didnt. idk how. havnt been able to find anything on yt too, oddly enough ok so on your radio go into the elrs lua and turn on wifi mode, then on your phone/laptop/any wifi enabled device connect to a wifi network called `ExpressLRS` with the password `expresslrs`, that should pop up a webpage that looks like [this](https://www.expresslrs.org/assets/images/web-banner.png), from there you can set your bind phrase for your radio which then you just have to match on your drone feel free to ask for any clarification or if something doesn't work just set the phrase to 369369, put it in bf but it still wont connect"
is model match enabled in your radios elrs lua?,ah you need to set your radio to a packet rate without a F (which stands for full)
"When i save yhe bind phrase it tells me reboot is required, is that just powercycle the radio?",since spi recevers dont support full rate packets
And then it should work with the bind phrase?,Well it just complained abt losing telemetry
have you enabled telem in betaflight?,Yeah. OH its connected Look at you being helpful
does betaflight throw any specific errors?. like this. are you using a usb cable that supports data?. have you tried another cable?. try another micro usb cable since that looks like one that probably doesn't support data. did the drone come with one?,Hi I cant conect my meteor 65 pro to betaflight configurator can you help
have you installed [this](https://impulserc.com/pages/downloads)?,No I downald configuration in github.com ok then install the driver fixer too
What driver fixer. This?,the thing i linked above I don'n understand how to downald click the blue button I need conect drone or controler drone. ok try a diffrent cable But app writte. He need controler not drone no. its looking for the flight controller in the drone Flight controller = the main board of the drone @NOXI. the brain of the drone yeah because your usb cable isnt doing any data
Yes then i change cable. ?. ?,try restarting windows I cant conect drone to radio
Elrs?. and what radio,"Elrs radiomaster boxer Ok so set your bind phrase in the `recever` tab in betaflight then follow these instructions to set the bind phrase on your radio https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1265257067493593119 The new meteor65 has a serial reciever not a spi one. So you set the phrase in the web ui or when flashing can you help them pls So, in your Radiomaster boxer, go to the ELRS lua script and turn on WiFi. Then connect to the ELRS tx WiFi that shows up, via your computer or phone. It should open a page, send a pic of that page. Password is “expresslrs”"
"ok, first the setup tab (I'll want yout o post a pic of each tab as we go). perhaps you could open discord on your comnputer and use printscrn so I can get higher def. ah, in the reciever tab, the lines below the quad model move when you move the radio's sticks?",sorry how to do printscrn i forgot
do you have a multimeter?,maby gps or led strip your quad doesn't have either I don't know:grinning_face_with_sweat: power and battery next. unsure if the meteor65 has a current sensor
"anyway here's where you would calibrate voltage and current if/when you have equipment like a multimeter to refrence against. anyway, the voltage thresholds are correct, onto failsafe. ah, you don't have all the tabs. ok, modes tab. ok. which switch is set up to arm?. basically which switch on your transmitter is channel 5. and which is channel 6. this tab is where you set up your switches, basically","the inclusion of horizon mode is questionable but ok scroll down to the rest of the modes. You’ll want to set up beeper and flip over after crash can someone help me in voice 1 Click add range, then wiggle the switch you want its about bete flight"
"Which channel is that on your radio? You can check in the reciever tab, or by looking in your radio at the mixes page. you'll want to set up beeper and flip over after crash. ah, which switch si flip over after crash on?. what channel is that connected to on your radio?",Whtf my setings is gone Yesterday. Never mind
Is that what it currently looks like?,"Ok. You don’t have any switches assigned at all then. Select ch5 and click. Wait let me boot up my radio so I remember how to do this. ok, yeah click, then select the ""source"" line, then actuate the switch you want to assign. for ch5, probably the left bumper button How to do this. Can we join to call maybe. my internet is very slow att he moment"
for what sort of build? And what stack specifically?,Addressing here https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/886098469016723456/1265234135275016202 Dirty double-posters
Can you send a photo of page 5?,"Not necessarily, this is the mixes screen not the switches screen. Check the next page yes necessarily, if there's nothing in the mixes, nothing will be sent on that channel"
dam this drones been such a pain to set up.. what do you do if your acceleromter is 90 degress off?. my pitch and my roll are swapped. oh i figured it out,You can adjust it in the configuration tab i found it thanks. im working thru it... this boards been a pain to set up. im getting like excessive throttle when i arm. working thru it though.. ok got that fixed..now oscilating.
Is there a way to discharge a lipo faster with Hota D6 Pro? -0.2A is way to slow,"30° is not a slight tilt, it will be fine, BF can compensate for it, but try to make it level"
what do you guys think this problem is? https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SbeJG9Nl7AM. confirmed that props are the correct way and the motors are spinning right.,"You can buy a big chonky resistor, solder an xt60 lead to it and plug it at the back then select ""ext discharge"" to discharge your lipos"
but I do have to monitor it so it doesnt go under 3.8V right?,"The charger handles that for you I wanna have my batterys as fast as possible to storage condition It still reads the voltage, so it can just cut off when it gets to the desired voltage okay nice. could this work when I use adaptor to plug it into the back Well buy like a chonky 10ohm resistor rated for a rather high current (5A continuous minimum) so it can discharge the batteries at ~2.5A (assuming 6s batteries) I mean xt60 female to female You can just solder on the right connector"
why not faster?. forgot to put the link  https://www.rotorama.de/product/vifly-storesafe-xt60,"It will already discharge some 1300mah packs at 2c, it's not particularly slow"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwV8N1tczU wait why does this guy have the lipo at the back,"That has an amazing discharge capacity of *1* watt. Cause the charger can be powered by an external chonky battery for field charging bruh so its even slower than my hota d6 pro by 5x:skull: Cause all the amps you pass inside will become heat, so you can't discharge super fast without active cooling"
"Ok, super silly question time. Is there a way (at the moment I don’t want to do fpv, just want to fly it) to “stream” a tiny camera to a phone screen instead of goggles?","You could just plug in 3 PC fans if you want to, they use continuous DC voltage after all, but they will run *fast* and I'm not sure they will draw much more than a chonky resistor"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPMqeept3pw ill build this without the step down converter,"Yeah that's not a bad idea, you can get away with a much smaller resistor if you have active cooling, and you plug it into the hota d6 pro instead of the battery"
just tried the pro drone antenas and there is no improvement. Are the ev800ds that shit?,"Yes that is a possibility. I could use a little more context around what issue you're having i arm, and give some throttle and then i get about 1 second of flight and i get a runaway error on the osd.. this is a new drone buld of a whoop with this board https://www.ebay.com/itm/387182002564"
"Do you notice the quad spinning out of control, or flipping/rolling?","no its relatively stable,"
Sounds like maybe PID oscillation then. I'm pretty sure that FC has no blackbox storage--could you get DVR of it happening and upload it here?,yes.. https://youtu.be/AQ31lkbuoYU https://youtube.com/shorts/FDHh_x85wRw. it reboots.... but i guess sometimes it says runaway
any way to boost transmittion power above 400mw?,"I feel like I remember telling you :loudly_crying_face:. but yeah, some EV800D see zero improvement from better antennas you did but i was hoping for atleast something and no, you can't really boost the VTX power"
"Ive got the same goggles... starter set. Hi, can you give me a hand with something?... check my videos?","well.... https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/546421137077305398/1241829322692493423. are you using a b2.0/a30 b2.0. i kinda want to just do a fresh flash on it. but one motor is spinning slower than the others... there's no point doing a fresh flash any goggles that i can buy that can support WS but are budget and wont be shit might sell the ev800d so one motor is at 45000 and the other 3 go up to 50500 can you connect to it using esc-configurator, read the config and send a screenshot and also send a picture of the drone itself. There's not really any analog goggles with good HDMI input at a low budget, there's the Walksnail L goggles which are 200 dollars... There's the Goggles X for 450, Sky04X Pro for 450 and the Cobra X for analog only for 250."
"the walksnail l they new i suppose, cuz i havent heard of them any good?","thats fighting me , i have to run out ill be back in a bit to try again. yeah they're great, not very upgradable and strictly for budget WS. You need to have Betaflight closed and a battery plugged in"
is that what you wanted?,yup. I'd probably reflash them all to 48KHz
hmm ok i have to run out .ill  beback in a  bit.. from  betaflight ?,"No, in ESC-Configurator bottom right, flash all button that looks scary.. ill bbl."
Just double checking something before I place an order.  Unfortunately the threaded inserts on one of my dji o3 is cracked and the scre only turns and turns. I'll get it out eventually but I'll need to replace the insert. Instead of a cheap plastic/thin metal I'll get a decent replacement.   According to this the screws are m2 and 4mm in L. I am assuming the threaded insert would be the exact same? M2 L4MM?,"I'd just use an unhealthy amount of loctite Ye one user on redit, did mention that you can tear it down and rescue that nut with glue. Tbh I now have the exact measure ent of the nut and it's proving hard to find. M2 diameter 2mm and depth 2.5mm. Glue night be the way to go."
"hi, ok im back..  is therea guide or someting ?","have some trust in yourself. you don't touch that one. if you look at your previous screenshot, it says what esc you have. O-H-5 Ah fuck lol.... just snapped 2 of the screws :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:.   Just ordered a replacement case for the camera. 15 euros job done."
hah thanks..  so that should do it?,"yup. by the way, don't buy this aio again but I'm sure you know by now omg its  been so bad.. everything was like configurd so weird.. It's an utter disaster, I don't know how Happymodel messed it up so bad given they've made plenty fine products the part that really got me was how the default gyro was 90 degrees off well it's probably configured for the mobula6. which has it mounted at 90 degrees ahh yes.. hey, that worked... Thank you so much. heyy you're not done. bump up the startup power in the settings. and in the bottom right, open the melody editor and pick a tune hehe i saw that tune stuff. ok give me a few. the start up power is all the way up.. meh.. still having what seems like power issues... not sure what to do... did you solder the leads yourself I mean you can try lowering the PID loop frequency in Betaflight I guess"
"0802? No. Can you type dump in cli, copy paste the output to a text document, then put that .txt in this chat?","In your pids tab make sure dynamic idle is off (you might have to set it to 0, i dont remember) and also turn off vbat sag compensation. Then goto your motors tab and increase idle to 7.5 ok testing. thank you. I cant guarantee anything, but hopefully it helps yea no go... hmm... i have to run out for a bit im gonna pick it up later thank you for th ehelp though. you should get some. solder practice boards..."
"Can you tell me the symptoms before you go so i can think about it?. Besides ""feels like low power""","Yea so this is a new board in here.  Basically it takes off then flys for about a second, drops and reboots. If you scroll up there DVR and video. It's a mobula 7 and this aio https://www.ebay.com/itm/387182002564 Sorry i should have looked harder before, that seems like a hardware issue to me. Ive had a fc reboot like that when the power leads were bumping against the cf frame, i wonder if you have some sort of inconsistent short somewhere Yea ok I'll rip it apart and see if there's anything suspicious, one last thing though there's one motor that maxes out at 40500 rpms and the other three go to 54500  or something like that .. so one motor is at 45000 and the other 3 go up to 50500"
"Do you know how a quadcopter yaws?. In order to turn in the yaw axis, the flight controller has to command at least one motor to a lower throttle than the others, to produce an imbalance in the combined angular momentum of all four motors",This is in the motor section of beta flight that the max rpms are observed Then you have one motor that is incapable of reaching a higher RPM. That's a mechanical problem
Is that an issue?. Based on these symptoms?,"Well, maybe, maybe not. There is always one motor out of a set that is weaker than the others--that's just how life works. The FC will balance it out by commanding the other motors to lower throttle settings when you're in a normal flight attitude. But that motor will ultimately be a limiting factor to your quad's performance. Whether or not that is an issue is up to you. I'd be willing to bet it will also fail before the others though. It'll produce more heat"
Is it just me or do 2 of the fets in the first picture look a little bubbly?. The one by the ground wire and the other by the positive wire,"Looks more like flux to me, from soldering on the power lead"
"I have the Wizard X220S and Velox F7 in my cienwhoop, the FC doesn't ready the lipo battery drain correctly, like I fly with full lipo and suddenly after 3 min the quad drops dead, I check the goggles and it shows full or -0.2 V only, is this because the old ESC ?","Sounds like the Voltage sensor just needs to be calibrated.  They rarely are correct from the factory, and using a different ESC, they would only be correct by weird luck.        it's pretty easy to do. You should also calibrate your current sensor, if you use that. It will also be wrong  https://oscarliang.com/current-sensor-calibration/#Voltage-Sensor-Calibration  https://oscarliang.com/current-sensor-calibration/#How-to-Calibrate-Current-Sensor thanks, my multimeter is good for continuity test only, I need a new one. :PepeTape: @Only Bans. Different symptoms now.... After messing with software..."
Looks like a flyaway. Does it still reboot and cut video?,Yea I think so... And here's some solder and inspection photos.. no its not rebooting.. not sure where to go with this at this point... i think it needs  a flash solder stuff looks decent.
What are your pid settings?,"man .. let me check, i left them stock. Stock should be ok, but send a ss. Maybe hm did some shenanigans. There should be an option at the top to switch to pid profile 2, do that and see if all the sliders are in the middle"
yea so its this. oops. https://www.ebay.com/itm/387182002564. that.. so write those centered pids?,hmm that seems better seems like a motor got reversed sstandby while i check it. If it works with those pids we probably just need to dial back the top to sliders by maybe .3 or .4 ok so yea a motor was backwards somehow.. but now were back to fly for a second and reboot. Im pretty suspicious of the fc at this point
"yea, it was brand new.. im thinking a flash might get some stuff back in order?",Its worth a shot. First tho
What are your voltage meter scale and current meter scale in the battery tab?. Those are correct,"It is a normal betaflight flashing procedure, i just dont see the target name on happymodels product page First save a diff all   If you hit disconnect but keep it plugged in and goto the update page you should be able to click detect target. ok hey man i think im gonna have to run out here in a bit.... yea and this is why im like nervous about the falsh. it cant detect what it is.... Are there good drones for 200$. pls dont tell me to get more money i know thats also an option yo ian im gonna bail ill bbl the nazgul eco is getting good reviews analog 215 i assume they mean camera drones considering they have the camera drones role good assumption. have u bought used before what was ur experience i dont fly camera drones anymore. its the best you can get for around 200 tho how about brand new options. i could do with a 1080p camera as long as the drone flies well has okay battery life I bought a drone from amazon 30$ i think it lasted 3 hours dji is your only option Started it up and drifted full speed into a wall. Broke 2 motors. What about HolyStone. Why does dji have a market monopoly lol. I wish dji made a drone that flew as well as the mini 2 and cheaped out on the camera maybe 1080p and electronic stabilisation instead of a gimbal for a cheaper price theyre bad knockoffs of dji mavic and dji minis mostly. you said 200$ they underpay staff, practically slavery, get money directly from their government. all that. and more and that's how you make cheap stuff that is still really good Cant go wrong with slavery. idk why they didnt do this already 1080p is surely well acceptable I bought a 30$ ""4k"" drond that had at best a total of 10 pixels in the entire image you can get them for like 150"
Id the mini 2 1080p. Ebay?,"fyi. when it comes to cameras. resolution is practically meaningless without the other statistics It is. The image wqs like 7000×4000 or something. So its ""4k"" 4k with a 480p sensor. lol Yeah lol. 480p is. Pushing it. I think it was 144p. The reason i crashed is because the camera alos had a 5 second delay"
Okay so my video feed has been kinda sus with hdzero is that just how it is ?. I’m having a lot of break up at first I thought it was my antenna mount moving around cuz it had broken put a new one and worked better. but still not as good as before I had a crash last week. how can ik if it’s my antenna or something cuz in certain places it looks fine,not as bad as you had it. you got a capacitor right I feel like before my crash it was a lot better. Yea I do but. It’s on my xt60 aymeric installed it there cuz it’s almost impossible to put it on my esc. Unless I use a cap
wait as in like connected to the end of the xt60 wire?,a lot less effective. but don't talk about it with people because they'll start acting up
"I recently starting using these. Game changer!. Can't imagine life with out this.. Yesterday I posted about flying/cruising my nazgul to try and get more flight time. I managed about 6/7 min which wasn't to bad.   I was using tattu r line 1400 mah. Got my eye on this, 45g heavier what do you reckon 2 more min of flight time?",I have a nazgul xl5 eco 6s analog and would a sma proppelor like the truecore core work on it. Its mmcx
Are there any 3.5 inch frames out there that allows a 30x30 mounting for esc and fc?,"Yeah, some electrical tape will fix this"
Does the drone not work?,"you would need to adapt the VTX from MMCX to SMA first, then put an SMA antenna on the adapter I found out sma works on my one too I have bought a new launched BETAFPV air 65.. and on the back of this FC, I can see this red one is blinking like that.  I was trying to figure out the meaning of the led through technical support from betafpv but I was not able to find it at all. is there any website or anything to figure out the meaning of FC LED meaning. it works. but I'd like to know. Its probably just the mcu status led. If its blinking the mcu isnt fried"
is there anything I should do?. factory reset?,if it works then don't worry about it
just leave it?. doesn't blinking led mean something tho?,"a blinking LED can just be a regular ""I'm alive"" status indication If you want it to stop blinking plug in your battery backwards. You want to factory reset your working drone because  *checks notes*  A led is blinking on it. https://tenor.com/view/the-big-lebowski-what-the-hell-what-the-fuck-huh-what-gif-16553984"
"The pid frequency in the setup tab?. Thats good to know, might be useful in the future. Glad you got it going","I fried my esc luckily I’m alive can someone help me with getting a new one are there differences depending on the drone or how does it work I’m new to the drone community. By help i mean guide me on which is good which aren’t You probably want the #shopping-advice channel. Post the quad you own and ask for esc suggestions, someone will reply so i slowly increased it and then finally it started working.. pretty bizarre, however an interesting not, when i reset the pids to template 1 still has the issue, but choosing all centered pid options its fine... Soembody give me a idea what text shoud i put on my costum vifly whoopster v3 I think i ll put your name on it"
"pitch=forward, roll=turn, yaw=backwards?",Bigger number = spin faster https://tenor.com/view/drone-roll-pitch-yaw-flying-gif-20593940
Does the rest of the FC power up correctly when you connect a battery?,Correct I can see the FC’s led still. On both connections
"As long as there is storage space? If it is not a very sophisticated DVR, it might cut you off at whatever the maximum allowable file size is. That doesn't really explain why the receiver would get power from USB but *not* the battery, though?","It would help if they'd mention what FC they have, because there are some with pads that are specific to the regulator on the USB and nothing else Wish I’d knew. Lemme get a pic for ya"
Can you tell by this picture?,what do you mean you don't know. how are you doing anything when you don't know I don’t know what’s the brand or the model of the stack. Just trying to troubleshoot the situation. Here’s a closeup
Did you not purchase it?.... never connected to it with BF?,That’s what I am saying The receiver works when connected via type C to BF But it ain’t working when connected via battery It looks like an AxisFlying Argus Eco F405
Can I change the maximum allowable file size?,That depends on the goggles/dvr.
On the 800D. Can I change it?,"It’s complicated, again I’m just trying to fly this Quad"
why not just open it and see?,"If you ordered 4in1, it should say 4in1 then again... I'd say they're doing you a favor if you got the ELRS one instead..."
Why did you order 4in1 and not ELRS? @-Mythical-,"It's more complicated when we can't figure out what hardware you have and what options are available to you. If you bought it from a company and it isn't working, you should be talking to them about an RMA usually its 4 in 1 since the box from mine said 4 in 1 even though i bought elrs because its better to go for 4in1 and get ELRS module that might be upgraded without changing controller. plus I already ordered the reciever for the plane that is not ELRS. because if its not 4in1, then I can't return if its opened"
?. We already established that you got the wrong radio,"I was just curious why would anyone buy a 4in1 nowadays oh. yeah, everyone has their own different priority I mean, the boxer's integrated elrs is very good, and you can put an external elrs module into an elrs radio. So I was just wondering if you could just keep this radio if you don't intend to use the 4in1. But since you want the 4in1, that means that it needs to be replaced"
"this is kind of silly though?. if you're starting from scratch, why not go ELRS everything?","kinda expensive and I am flying a plane, you don't need that much range to go far no generally it is cheaper, even than flysky and such"
Elrs receivers are... Expensive?,30 dollar for DLG ELRS
"Out of receivers that actually work reasonably well, ELRS ones are the cheapest xD. Dlg?",ER6G. https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/er6g-er6gv-2-4ghz-elrs-pwm-receiver okay but they. they make cheaper ones. <https://betafpv.com/collections/expresslrs-series-accessories/products/elrs-micro-receiver> like here's the first search result Im saving money more to buy ELRS module   and I am trying to sell my whole  DJI FPV air unit to go for walksnail and use my boxer for it That's even more reason to get the elrs variant of the radio lol. The internal module is almost top of the line. You save a bunch of money that way but the ELRS  external module might be upgraded with higher watts and range
Ok? You can do that regardless.,"You've so far only given reasons you would want ELRS, even in the plane with referring to prices. You can put an external elrs module into a radio with internal elrs, noone is stopping you @-Mythical-. And you don't have to pay 30 for a pwm receiver, there are cheaper ones... but I really need the 4in1, its more feature and I might have lot of recievers that are not ELRS So far you only said that you have 1 receiver that's not elrs. Which makes the whole 4in1 thing pointless. If you have more, then that can be a different argument.."
also... more feature? :thinkies:. less feature. way less feature,Well.... Elrs plane receivers are a bit Spartan for now. And sensors are hard to come by I mean they can have everything you need now Wondered if there was something I could do before contacting the supplier let's be real if you're putting sensors on a plane like that with no FC you're probably building something that costs almost as much as a car I'm just making sure that I'm being fair to all sides :face_with_tears_of_joy:
You said when you try and arm? What happens when you arm?,It doesn’t let me. It’s weird it’s my it’s on a different channel. 13 vs the 7. I had to keep tuning off my drone and control like mess with it. But idk why it’s happening Ah that's beyond my skills etc sorry buddy. Was hoping I could help.  No idea what it could be
"Ok, looking at my first drone build. I don’t want to get any FPV cameras or anything to start with, I just want to get it off the ground and moving about. This is what I was looking at, as hopefully I can upgrade it with a camera and slap my gopro on it if it goes well. I am on a bit of a budget, so if this seems suboptimal, then that’s probably why. I still don’t know whether the motors are good, and what type of battery (6S or 4S) to use. No clue about props either.   Motors - T-Motor F1507 Motor - 3800Kv (not sure about these)  Flight Controllers - SpeedyBee F405 V3 Flight Controller Stack - F405 FC, 50A 4in1 ESC (this is the esc too)   Frames - SpeedyBee Bee35 3.5"" Cinewhoop Frame Kit  Receivers - RadioMaster Bandit BR1 915/868MHz ELRS Receiver (looks like it has an antenna already?)  Gear: Transmitter - Radiomaster Pocket    https://www.quadpartpicker.com/lists/clz17e0sq00noxdz9syuuvcwz","Well, the speedybee f405 v3 is a very very bad fc, it will just crap it's pants if you use the blackbox and osd at the same time, get something from skystar or diatone instead, and the pocket doesn't work with elrs 900, it only has elrs 2.4, you need a 2.4ghz receiver like the rp1"
"Oh bugger, that’s why I was looking up the RPs, forgot why I was half way through, oopsy daisy. Also, do I need to use the blackbox or OSD?","Well, you might need to in the future, but regardless, get something from skystar or diatone, cause their escs are also crappy, most things speedybee are crappy Yea the Speedybee v4 stack is much better if you *must* stick with Speedybee, but ultimately those electronics are pretty cheaply made. 3800kv is reasonable for a 4S build, but the motor itself is an unusual stator size--you might consider looking for a motor that's around 2004 or 2005 size (better for cooling). Ok cool, I’ll keep that in mind. You should also think about what sort of prop you want to use--a lot of motors in this size class are using T-mount props (small center pin with two screws) instead of a 5mm prop shaft (like you'd see on a 5""), so you need to make sure you pick a motor and prop that will fit together"
"So stay with 12mm diam motors, just find a 2004 or 2005? Gotcha.","12mm is the motor *mount* screw spacing, *not* the motor diameter That is what I mean, sorry should have clarified. All new jargon and I keep forgetting it :) Nw, there are a lot of things to keep track of lol"
"Do you know of any good motors inside those specs? Can’t seem to find any, other than these AxisFlying ones which seem a newer brand.","1805 would work too, let me see"

@Vitroid https://betafpv.com/collections/brushless-motors/products/lava-series-2006-brushless-motors do these look good?,2400kv would be for 6s
"I'm fairly sure that's because it isn't made anymore. This link looks sketchy, but I just copied it off their website.

Single strap or double strap?,however hard you intend on crashing. and if you have proper grip pads or not
At what voltage should I charge 650 mah batteries?. Cnhl ministar. 4s,"There's no space to double strap. Normally you wouldn't worry about the voltage at which you charge a LiPo, if you know the cell count.. You just set that up in the charger, and start a balanced charging"
are they HV or normal?,then to the regular 4.2V per cell here's a photo. oh I meant how many ampers I wouldn't alter any charger settings for this or 0.7A if your charger doesn't go down to two decimals is ok. k. What's the like maximum safest. amount. of amps I think it's pretty reasonable to charge at 2C. (ie 1.3A)

Nevermind it does not work anymore. is there sombody that can hellp me with this problem?,did you perhaps change usb ports or cables i did. and still i had the same problem You aren't in bootloader mode
how can i go in bootloader mode?. I tried to look up wich version i have in the Connect -> Cli -> typing version but output stays empty,"you're not connected.... you're in the ""demo"" mode. which you're also trying to flash to i really thought i was connected"
"so when you plug in your fc, windows comes up with an error right?","can you try a different cable wait but now you sent a video of it working. :thinkies: it did not work. Because i got a error saying Failed to open serail port This is still in virtual mode. Why. Close and reopen BF Configurator, then go here and turn off this switch so you stop doing this"
I turned of virtual connection mode. Still it does not download.. Or am i doing it wrong?,"Looks like BFC is trying to put it in Bootloader mode but there might be an issue with the bootloader driver.

Then it opened dfu where it let me update"
Did you get this problem to?,"Yup. It was a bootloader issue.

"So if I was to advise him, I wouldn't get in trouble?","Eh technically you have to follow Visual line of sight rule. So if anyone was to try and help they would get in trouble Actual rules on this vary from nation to nation, and it isn't always true. Spotters are an essential option in USA's Part 107 operations, for example. You aren't going to get more range out of it without extensive modification u should redo the soldering. especially the bottom one VLOS is a rule in like most countries We have no way of policing what people do or don't do, regardless of what is or isn't legal in their location. If we were to deny this user any information on the grounds that long range flights are illegal, we might as well start recommending Spektrum radios to everyone instead of ELRS because ELRS's range is illegal anyway. It is, however, important to try to provide the best information possible, so just randomly throwing information out there that only applies to a less regulated nation isn't very helpful Turns out I fried the FC on one quad and on the second one I fried the ESC… from what the supplier said I connected the battery wrongly, so just did a combination of both quads and now I have one running"
dude are u serious :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. did u watch **a bunch** of soldering tutorials?,"thats how it should look like This should be fine right it does not touch anything it is a bit messy i know that The boosters are fake, I'd recommend to not have any Bluetooth/Wifi signals around you/controller/drone also I have found that on my Air2 if I put on airplane mode it helps a bit with range, make sure to not fly near electric wires and cell towers.  I also thought about reccomending you  to modify the drone, but then understood that the mod would cost roughly the same as the entire drone :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
Does this cause the problem i have right now?,yes the wires make no contact. no its not fine because thats far from being a good soldering job. pretty far.... it might cause waaaay worse issues if your drone just crashes because RX is lost. or u lose video. whatever. compare your soldering with the ones shown in the picture. and fix them i will resolder it after i fixed the main problem because even though i resolder it does not fix the problem. I saw my own soldering it was the worst while u wait u can fix it :winking_face:
Anybody able to help me figure out how far I should be able to go with my setup for antennas and drone? Currently getting about 1-1.5 miles on 1.2w walksnail. I feel like it's too low.,X2-Airs with those omnis. Ik the omnis don't matter for this but ye
with the patches on the bottom two? it's insane that you got 1.5 miles. if they're on the top two? you can go way further,"Nah tx is on the patches, I got only about 0.75 milesish when tx was on the omni. I swapped the ufl for tx to the bottom right patch in that photo"
"you should be able to go further, but what kind of environment are you in?","@Loku :Latvia: @DædalusFPV thanks for the helpful insight, appreciate you two Uh i typically just choose whichever channel looked the best, I do not remember which channel I was on specifically. 25mbps, 720p go on the last channel, there's a pretty decent chance you're getting messed up by a whole bunch of WiFi No problem, if you need any other help regarding the Potensic, I'd recommend to ask in #camera-drones"
The public channel? :face_with_open_mouth:,"thaniks, ill be sure to use it next time! also, you should be able to keep it on 50mbps 1080p fine Granted this was on my tiny whoop but I noticed less range and stability at 1080p 50 then with 720p 25, like a fairly noticeable amount so I assumed it was gunna apply to the bigger vtx as well"
"Close to it yes, lemme double check the firmware page. So I should be on which channel? Cuz I was most likely on channel 1 walksnail 25mbps when doing it. Channel 7?. Or channel 3 if 50",channel 7 on 25. channel 3 on 50. if you look at the thingie above those are out of wifi
Can almost guarantee I was not on those bands. I typically stuck around channels 1-4 depending on like whichever had the best signal in the selector. How far do you think I should be able to go?,uuh I mean. so many factors but people have gone like. tens of miles on those antennas
hell yeah? they added a bunch of cool stuff. including the app compatibility. if yours do that,"I'm on the fatshark dominators lol I ain't cool like tht. I want the goggles x but my god I've seen so many people just go on and on about the issues with it so idk those are pretty much fixed. in the new batches. and when you do have issues they repair em for free and give you goodies Huh ok, noted. Ima save tht channel graph and try channel 7 when I fly next, wish me luck I do recommend you update though. there's always little improvements sprinkled in Aight. P easy so yea why not. As long as it don't make it worse lol"
"are there ws2812 ""dummy"" chips that place the leds after them farther along the indexes?","hm, never heard of them Hey everyone! New here and need a hand .. been trying to find these jst connections as it just broke off my naked gopro.. is it worth trying to find them or just getting the new pcb board for $10"
Does it have a locking tab? Likely JST-GH,yes it does and believe thats why it ripped out you can just direct solder any connector on if you want. but check if the pads are even there still Did a little digging and found these. pads look to be okay just the pins pulled out of the connection.. yeah just solder on some wire or a new connector
can you show your wiring?,"sure, 1 sec. Pretty sure everything is in the right place and I've wired it together a few times now between testing it with other VTX and testing the VTX with a separate camera."
"Im just starting out new with this hobby, so i just got my first drone, how do the rates transfer from the Sim into irl? i use velocidrone to practice ill attach my rates as a screenshot do i just transfer these over 1:1 to betaflight (the rates are actual). im asking, because when i input my rates into the betaflight configurator and tested it on the preview thingy, it felt a bit off","I'm not sure rates are expected translate perfectly to BF from a sim. Maybe the rates do but the other factors make it tough to judge what is off.. I've not flown a sim for years and never tried velocidrone either though so take that with a pinch of salt the rates fly really well for me in Sims, i havent gotten to fly irl yet, but maybe its just  the betaflight preview window, it felt a bit laggy and weird.."
"oh, yeh, maybe that is just a preview so you can test your TX is working as expected?","oh, yeah then i guess that shouldnt be a problem. i can only test my drone tomorrow, so i hope it goes well, lol fingers crossed, first time is always a little dicey, no powerloops :winking_face: Analog video and such is really sensitive and your wiring just isn't going to cut it, you need to purchase better solder."
"Not really sure what wiring you mean, the white wire was factory soldered and all I've done is connect the white and blue together..?","I don't really know how to tell you this, but none of that solder work looks like it will hold when actually mounted on something that moves. Just buy some BNTECHGO wire and better solder to fix up those joints. I'd also check the plug on the runcam board, it doesn't look fully seated/the wires look goofy. It's fully seated, it gets power as per my initial post. I'm more concerned about getting it to work than mounting it to a quad :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Alright im sick of stripping down 20AWG cables to fit in 22AWG vias, would someone tell me the best way to solder on connectors without melting them for tinywhoop battery leads?","I'm looking at making my own ion pack, and from what I'm seeing, as long as you know what you're doing, soldering it is fine. I wanna know what yall think, should I solder it or spend the $40 on a spot welder"
do you know what your doing?. if so go for it,"I think im good enough at soldering to do it damn right!!!!!. looks perfect. you should also make your own lipos from now on I'm 90% sure I know what I'm doing quickly tin the terminal, tin the nickel strip, place the 2 tinned parts against eachother and melt them together for a few seconds what is that :loudly_crying_face: nickel or copper, to connect the terminals"
are you not doing directly wire?. ohhh to save on wire. ok ok. good luck. let me know how it went,"I'm not sure I wanna put that many amps through a little wire, and a big one is well, big, I would prefer it compact I am going to make own li ion soon. hope its gonna go well. still unsure where each wire goes. but il watch some guide thats a pretty important thing to know well of course. its why il watch a guide"
I need help. Just quick question. The charging port under the tx16s. What’s that for to charge the lipo battery in it?. Or do I need to get a whole charger,it charges with the bottom usbc port it's to charge the little 2s battery inside of it
Did you wait for the GPS to get a lock?,"Hey, I just bought a Cinelog35 v2 O3 GPS and I tried to do my maiden flight but couldn't fly because i got a ""GPS"" message when arming I assumed that it's because the GPS is not properly configured, but everything seems to be fine... except that the GPS icon uptop in betaflight never turns yellow :S Show the GPS & ports tab Noup, but I figured I could fly without the GPS signal lock, as with any other FPV drone That's a setting, but by default you need a GPS lock first"
"Oh ok.. I would like to be able to fly without GPS if possible. But first, what am I doing wrong with the GPS config?",I honestly recommend you update to 4.5.0 before we do any debugging. 4.5 improved the RTH substantially
"LED strips? no, just the FC, RX and O3 standards","You probably want Auto Baud off It was off at the beginning, but I changed it to see if something happened... but no nothing son of a.... I think I see the problem well that would do it, that's what I was gonna ask next. lol really consider updating to 4.5, it should be as easy as `diff all` saving that to a file, flashing it, loading the diff into the CLI and done After this I'm going to tighten all of the screws just in case haha gotta invest in blue loctite Will do! just want to test it ""out of the box"" to be sure everything is working. I won't use the RTH just yet, I'll settle for the arrow pointing H. I have a bottle just for that :slightly_smiling_face: the cinelog is a great quad, you'll enjoy it loads I believe you completely, GEPRC have great quads! I had a MARK5 analog and it was freaking awesome... until I fup and drowned it at sea haha. I rescued it and used the frame to build my own 5"" The design is very inspired from OddityRC's cinewhoops, and those are amazing as well This cinelog is my first digital drone. Didn't want to fall for DJI but... they are the best IMO, but expensive as hell Walksnail is pretty much identical. other than it being a little worse penetration-wise. which is nice at least, there's competition Yeah true, but I do need that penetration that DJI offers, specially for recording events and buildings oh yeah if you're doing commercial work. or things that are like commercial work. that's the place DJI still wins, even if it's *just* because it is the standard on the field"
"I'm starting that line of work in my area. I think I have enough skills to do it properly... I hope so at least haha. If not, I'll still have a lot of fun with the new quad :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. BTW... whats the setting to fly even without gps lock?","haha ok, no probs, I'll look it up. Thanks a bunch @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Allow arm without a fix in your fail safe settings be extremely careful. with failsafe settings. it can be really dangerous Very true! For now I just want to fly it like a normal FPV drone. Later on I'm going to check the full JB vid on GPS rescue. I know it's extremely easy to mess it up It's also important to review gps rescue altitude settings every time you fly a new terrain. (the settings that decide how the quad should manage altitude while heading back home)"
"Got it, similar to a mavic or mini DJI drone, right?","Always check whats the tallest thing in your surroundings update to 4.5 before you try RTH by the way lol hahah will do, promise"
"what can i use as an alternative to loctite? i have nail polish, ptfe tape and elmers glue im gonna assemble f450 drone kit","Get some e6000/welder glue and use that. Kinda everything, antennas also count, but it's mainly the goggles and camera"
Feels like it does. Although I was testing indoors. I sometimes feel like the draft from the blades against the walls might create some backwash that affects flight performance?,Yes walls affect air flow
"Anyone have a suggestion for a small bag that I can use to store my whoop, cobra X, rm pocket and batteries? I saw that beta FPV has a small one that holds a whoop and some batteries","Torvol make good bags Torvol sling bag could work for you Thanks, let me check those bags out Said it first :face_with_tongue: You said torvol in general, so no"
Does the radiomaster RP1 need an additional antenna?,"It comes with one antenna, it only needs one antenna"
"Okey dokey.. Pricing totted up, looks… good :smiling_face_with_tear:. Ok, last question just to finish up. What’s the “best budget” 4S batteries and charger?","For the battery, it depends on the size of the quad, for the charger, get an m6d and a psu if you want to stay on a budget What does a m6d and a psu mean…. 3.5” Toolkitrc m6d is the name of the charger,  the psu means power supply unit, it's to power the charger, you could get an apd100/200 from toolkit rc for exemple, but anything that supplies enought watts at the right voltage will work"
How do I know which one I should use?. Or just like sizing dependence.,"Well, I would use the 850mah one, but if you are building a light 3.5"" then get the 650mah one"
Would the m6d mini work as well?,"Get the normal m6d. That is really low kv for 4s, that's for 6s"
Frame recommends 2500-3500kv for 4s and 1800-2300kV for 6s. Would the B6 NEO be a good alternative?,"Well that's bullshit, you want 3500-4000kv on 4s, and 2500-2900kv on 6s. I wouldn't cheap out on the one thing that can burn your house down I don't think you understand. cheaping out is getting the M6D. if you cheap out more, you NEED fire insurance. like maybe M8P if you NEED to go lower. but it is only capable of charging one at a time I don’t think at this stage I’ll need to charge more than one at once.. Sorry if I’m being obstructive, I’m just new and I don’t know much about this."
"Ok, would it be better to get a 6S then?","It would be better to change the motors, there isn't a whole lot of reasons to go 6s on a 3.5"" imo Okay, I’ll have a look then.. So I need smn that’s more than 20xx (as per some advice I got yesterday), 12mm mounting, and between 3500-4000kV. Ok time to do even more specific searching haha Eh, 20xx is very big for a 3.5"" quad Except if it's a cinewhoop, which is a completely different class of quad Yeah, that’s what I was aiming to, wanted to shove a GoPro on there, and that’s what the frame is made for. Ok well if it's a cinewhoop it's better to mention it, cause they use very different motors and stuff than freestyle quads, on a 3.5"" cinewhoop it would make sense to get a like 2004-2005 motor, not on a freestyle quad for exemplr. And my battery recommendation also flies out of the window, you want at least the 850mah"
"How does a cinewhoop massively differ in spec to a freestyle one?. Surely it’s similar, and the motor diff won’t change much?","It's a *lot* more heavy (like for exemple you have a gopro) and you use more blades (sometimes on bullnose props) to have the maximum amount of thrust in the smallest size, it's a very different class. On a 3.5"" freestyle you would get away with a 1604 motor, on a 3.5"" cinewhoop you want 1804 or a little bigger"
"Okay, sounds reasonable.. I’ll have a look at 1804s later, and I’m guessing still at that 4S range?","I would shift the range to like 3000-3500kv. But I would look for a motor bigger than 1804, 1804 is just the smallest I would use 2004-2006 is more what you should look at guys I have a mamba mini f722 fc and idk if its dead or not. I plugged in the battery and I only hear 3 beeps how do I  set fan speed on walksnail googles x. Its hot outside"
why the motor limit?. what kV are the motors,1900kv. I thought I will set it for the initial tests just so that I don't push it too hard nah throttle limit sure but 1900kv shouldnt get motor limited. if you were at like 2200kv then sure alright that can be removed otherwise we might need a video or DVR since im not sure what the problem is
"I'll share a video of the very first take off, nervously done tho. this was with Ezlanding enabled. 5145 props. should I use 5135 instead?",first takeoff indoors. great... except for that it looks fine. get some and see if you prefer them :slightly_smiling_face: was a little too confident on the motor directions and board & sensor alignments hehe. was flying 5135 with the 4S. Felt better than 5145
"sure. How much motor heat is a problem? 2 minutes of hover got them to the higher side of being 'warm', the 4S's Sunny Sky 2300kv motors seldom got warm","they shouldnt be more than slightly warm at a hover try flying properly for a few minutes and check their temp again sure, may be its the 'running in' i like to believe so haha. 5135 props should defenitely help there If you cannot hold the bell without being burned, they're too hot I can hold my fingers on them for several seconds, but felt that they were a bit too warm Yea that's getting up there. It's important to isolate what is causing a temperature problem. Sure, it *might* be the prop size, but it could also be your PID tune, or the fact that you were only hovering instead of actually flying around ordering 5135s to try them out. 5.1 inch props have a 1mm clearance between their tip and the top plate of the frame."
Do you get blinky lights? Anything in device manager?,"https://tenor.com/view/3d-printed-drone-3d-printed-quad-3d-print-drone-quad-gif-27695249 Aw the wee dwone is scared trying to change some settings on my ancient meteor65, and it won't even make the usb sound when I plug it in. ive tried like 4 different cables"
"If I want to connect my vista to my fc without using the plug, do I only need plus, gnd and tx and rx or also signal gnd ?",FC lights up but I can’t find anything in device manager
:flyfast: and charge your batteries?. The whole point of warnings is to tell you when something is wrong,The point is so that you can turn them off and say you did nothing wrong when it randomly broke! well i pulled the little peice of foam out of there and got the  canopy and camera dialed in so that the foam is not needed any more.. im sure a piece of foam sitting on the chips isnt a good thing.
"Anybody with a radiomaster zorro or other radiomaster radio, can you turn it on and listen if there is a whine or other sort of noise from the speaker when no audio is playing?","there is. it doesn't have a great audio circuit in there ive had the controller for months and never noticed it before lol, was just weirded out It's an easy thing for them to cheap out on ye i get tht, i just need to ignore it but its like once you notice it you then notice it all the time and that's why I stopped using it lol I meant the audio as a whole. but a tx16s sadly"
"oh, can i actually just turn off the speaker so I dont have to hear the hiss?. why sadly? I thought tht was a rly good radio to use?",It's uncomfortable and I usually don't need all the switches. I'll be getting a second radio at some point. yeah
I mean... I hope it wouldn't?. what do you mean?,Hay I need help. My radio master boxer. It is not connecting to my beta flight
Does anyone run their pinecil on 6s?. I’m seeing mixed answers online,"You don’t typically bind the radio to betaflight, you setup the drone and then connect the drone to the radio through that I have the the radio master boxer. Can I please please call you"
not only is your flight stack just bad. it literally won't fit?,It says it will (30.5x30.5)
Is it that bad? Heard they fixed the issues in V3 and released the V4?,"That’s what I read too. Yes, I was seeing posts where people recommending the v4 stack. Just want to check for potential issues with the combination of parts before I add them all to my cart and buy. I mean, it doesn't have the huge wiring issue of the v3, but it's still made with bottom of the barrel parts I used to use https://ecalc.ch/ website to do the performance, sizing, and spec-ing checks of integrated product during Arducopter days.. Your selection looks ok to me, but I have not really made a BoM for 3.5 inch quads. More familiar with 5 inch. Oh ok. I used to fly F405 V3. Never had issues with it during my 7 months of use. May that quad RIP.. Lost it to a human error."
Hmm ok.. Should I just yolo it and jump in with it then?,"from my understanding i know what angle_mode and rate_mode is . but i am trying to figure out what the difference between angle_mode and horizon_mode is. like angle mode has 2 PIDS first pid takes the angle and outputs the rate setpoint which is fed to the 2nd pid and continues to motor mixing. so what is horizon_mode , how different is it from angle mode in terms of of the above thing. so does horizon mode have two PIDs working similar to angle mode or its just a single pid where input is angles and output is what is being fed to motor mixer"
"Hi, what should i set my Maximum arm angle to? does it really matter, or can i just set it to 180°?","Set it to 180°. So you can arm even if you put your quad the ground and it isn't perfectly flat I just wouldn't get the newbeedrone motor if you can, and swap it with for exemple the rcinpower 2105 (not the one with the silly m2 shaft, the T mount one) or the flyfishrc/axis flying 2004, or go 6s and get a spinnyboy 2006 from oddityrc or an axis flying 2006  and I would also get a few more cinewhoop focused props like the d90s-3 Was fannying around about the axis flying ones because not many reviews about them. Yeah but axis flying makes pretty good motors"
So these should be good?,I'm very happy with the Axis motors on all my builds that have them
Is this voltage enough do you think?,"It's not going to be super good on 4s. You really want 6s for them But 6s’s are bad for a cinewhoop… hmm.. *not bad, just not as good cinewhoops can benefit from 6s in some cases It's kinda useless on a 3.5"" freestyle quad, but not so much a cinewhoop Ok, I’ll up it to a 6S and slap them on it then. Especially with bigger 2006 motors Yeah I was told 20xx would be good for better cooking. They will get better cooling because they are flatter and wider yeah"
"Just checking, any issues with the f405 mini by speedybee (yes, speedybee :clown_face: but just thinking)? If I get a 20x20 over a 30x30, gives me the option of digi transmission in the future.","I mean, it's speedybee. It won't be great but it will fly if that's what you are asking"
"Ok cool.. I’ve just found the flyfish ones which do 3500kv at 1804, still should I stay with the 20xx’s?","1804 is kinda small, I would stay with 2006"
"Ok, so I’ll swap out a few 6s lipos then, should I go between 850 and 1200mAh?","I would use a 6s 1100mah, maybe a touch smaller"
Can I use LiHVs instead of LiPos?,"Of course, the gnb flower decals are pretty good LiHV batteries. And they will be lighter. Tho they have a shorter shelf life"
"That’s the one.. Also, I’m done with selecting basically everything, how do I know what props to use? I’m using the axisflying 2006 2500kVs.. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) sorry, last thing.","You could get the d90s-3 @Hicksy the literal fatal flaws were fixed, but it's still not a great FC and the ESC has been shown to be quite bad too But it's a lot of trial and error when it comes to prop selection. You just get a bunch and see what you prefer I think it's quite silly to get a way worse stack when you can get something better for the same price. Extremely silly"
"UK.. So the sky stars f405 20mm^2 would be basically the same, just less fire-y?","yeah pretty much. You lose the bluetooth feature when you move away to same-price other stacks. but that shouldn't be a problem especially if you have an Android phone Ahem, Apple for my sins. Ok, I think I’ve got everything then :) Just gotta wait for the EU to save you"

"Hi, this might be a stupid question, but how do i know when i acutally have to land?, i have a Tinyhawk 3 freestyle, and even when the battery is fully charged and i go full throttle it says battery low, but like further into flying, it kind of becomes a problem, because if it says that the battery is low, how do i know when its actually about to be empty?  heres what my osd looks like:",you land when hovering at 3.5
like when the thing at the bottom says 3.5?. or do i have to enable sth else in the osd for that?,"The one at the top left. The one at the bottom seems to be the battery voltage, the one at the top seems to be the average cell voltage"
"Hi, so I just tried to do my maiden flight for my Cinelog 32 v2 GPS and something is definitly wrong. I was in altitude mode to just do a small hover and as soon as it got enough throttle it shot into the air like crazy. Had to quickly disarm and let it plumit. I checked the spin on the motors and they are in the proper direction, as well as the props. But I two motors did seem a bit strange... like stuttery. The other motors were working smoothly but those two have that small stutter or jitter... could that be the issue?","Im new to drones does this mean I couldn't fly my drone in a park above 50 metres. @Admin. As its a cta please do not pin helper/mod/admins... you will get a respond in time, when someone is seeing your message Sorry I was looking for help and sorry, I never flew a camera drone, only FPV so I cannot help you. just wait until someone gets to you, it usually doesnt take long Oh nice how fast does it go and what are the rules on them rules depend on your country/state and how fast does it go, mmh I never actually measured but should be around 120-140kph Make sure it flies in the simplest  mode first, so you put it into alt mode and then if something goes wrong you can fall back and keep control instead of disarm That's exactly what I did, I was in alt mode and it shot up. I just wanted to do an easy hover, fly a bit, then got to acro and keep testing. I updated to betaflight 4.5.1 and loaded the backup for the quad and made sure that the RTH was configured (although i haven't veryfied proper work obviously). Other than that.. it's brand new :S Whenever I test my quads I start in acro or stabilized and do a little hop or two so I make sure it works. Then I do hovers in acro/stabilized and then I try out the other modes that do alt hold and stuff. So if it does shoot off I can put it back in acro and fly it back. Or crash-land it Yes, I undertstand. I'm only working int alt mode, and it flies away. I couldn't test hoirzon or acro.. That's the issue, so I end up crash-landing it"
"Oh and the accelerometer is calibrated. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Hey, it's me again, with the Cinelog 35 V2... should I try to fly the drone without the GPS enabled?. To see if it doesn't shoot to the sky","@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what was that one site you mentioned for selling drone stuff. Where I could look for a 1s transmitter AliE, Mercari, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace Can I fly within these zones. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) This is the footage of the maiden flight in altitud mode. It's very clear that it isn't flying as it should :/ Yup... but I can't understand why What fpv drone is it. Raven can you fly inside control zone From my understanding, you shouldn't. It tends to be restricted for some different reasons... depends on the country but you can't fly near hospitals, airports, seaports, military bases, etc. Cause I'm 12 miles from the nearest airport and upto wear I live it's all control zone Maybe you are near area 51 ! Strange, you should check your drone regulation laws. I can't say more because I don't know them Yes I have checked them it says you can fly in ctr if drone under 250g"
"Upated: I disabled the GPS and the exact same thing happened. It seems to be the tune, from what I gather, but I would appreciate some input from someone more experienced. I tried in both altitude mode and acro, same thing happened. Do the motors have to be non reversed for cinewhoops?. So I tried reflashing with the latest firmware and loading the backup configuration and I saw this:. Don't understand why I should have this issue, I just backed up the factory defaults :S",One of my motors failed mid air and now doesn't work properly
"Ok so I seem to have fixed that issue, I think it was the accelerometer but I restored the factory settings and it's not flying strange. But... my new issue is that the O3 is transmitting black blocky images. It wasn't doing it before and now suddenly it is. is that a common thing? it's my first time using DJI systems. I can see the betaflight and DJI OSD, but the image is very poor","Raven how much are fpv drones. @RavenTMX It depends, tinywhoops can be around 100-150 USD, 5"" from 200-600... depends on a lot of things... size, brand, RX, VTX, etc. and thats just the drone Are they already pre built"
VRX connected to DJI goggles?. or am I crazy. are they on the same version?,"Hi all, I have cineape 25 walksnail and walksnail VRX. When I try to pair them, it’s not working.  I plug the battery, into the drone and the led on the vtx is green. With the vrx on, I push the pair button and the led on the vtx is red now.  I push the pair button on the vrx and have black screen with red vignette edges.   If I disconnect the batteries, power on the drone and the vrx the vrx stays in “no connected” mode.. I’ve updated the VRX to the latest firmware The vrx is connected to external display, but it’s the same when mounted on hdzero. I plug the battery i. Basically the vtx led is blinking green. I push the pair button and it’s solid red. I push the pair button on the vrx and I have black screen with red ages. Status switches between “Ch7” and “No Sig” and the vrx start beeping.  On the bottom left it’s showing “0 volts” with fully charged battery .. also make sure antennas are plugged in and try turning off standby mode They’re on the same version. First time I heard of standby mode, will check it."
do the motors spin in the direction shown on the diagram?,"I'm not sure what you mean by that, but if you mean like to take it out of angle mode and into ""manual"" mode (or airmode) you just need to go into the modes tab in betaflight, and make the angle switch like that for exemple (since if I recall correctly it is mapped to the entire range, you might need to map it to a switch if it's not already done) so it only enters angle mode (angle mode is when the quad stays leveled) when you push the switch you assigned to it, the rest of the time it will be in ""manual"" mode What I mean is like upgrade it bc it’s. Pretty slow when am free-styling. Can the ese over hear from 30 min of straight flying dealing out the battery’s as soon as one dies When i arm it and geven Just a little trottle it flips test carefully with the props off"
I Will test when im home. My vtx got rll Hot tho. Oh and. Idk how to mount my battery. The props might also be hitting the battery strap. Abd the battery strap cant go over the stack. Bc i have no room. how tho ?,"you can spin the motors up very slowly in the Motors tab yea 1018. but i still cant tell and if you want to get the sense of spin direction, just touch the motor bell when you spin it at a very slow speed ah ty. okay motor 1 is reversed. motor 2 aswell motor 3 also. so they are all reversed what are the odds. go ahead and change directions one by one and test again"
uhm then it should have taken off right ?. bc i reverse d the props. when it did not go up the first time,I won't assume anything because I have had my share of 'take off and spinning uncontrollably until disarm' situations when board alignments and motors directions were messed up
could the motors hitting the battery strap be the issue ?,"I will make sure that the motors spin as shown in BF, of course you can reverse it (props in Vs props out) but it has to match with what is shown in BF i did that. my vtx is hot again :grimacing_face:"
Why dont you put it in pit mode?,"until you figure things out with the motors smart. ill send a pci. pic So I flew it after about 18 hours, all good. i just cant do the strap over the stack. it dont fit From the pics it looks like the blades are almost touching the strap. I wouldn't fly it like this... It also looks like the strap is not tight enough"
what should i do now then ?,"Move the strap from propeller's spin perimeter May be consider using slightly smaller diameter props (for eg, 5 inch instead of 5.1 inch) you tell me! I can't make it out from the pics"
what you mean over the stack? route the strap under the stack? not recommended. you just route it underneath the top plate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFHVA_qM3uw,"yea, over the FC, below the top plate. i mean it will work but it ads some preasure on the stack If you route the strap under the FC, of course it will add some pressure on the FC. but when you route it between the FC and the top plate, the FC is free. ah i see the problem now"
yea. my stack is a bit to big for the frame ig :man_shrugging:. you think it works or should i not do it ?,"may be you can do a workaround - take off the soft mounts, cut them short by a millimeter. test at your own risk prob wont work bc the wires from the fc to the esc go under the fc. and they are already together. idk if you can see but these bottom ones are pushed down a bit already. bc of the bolts Use thinner straps (not recommended) :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: might have smt a little thinner. yea no. does not fit"
"Not very likely that every component will be destroyed. But why don't you first connect the FC to computer powering it only by the USB cable and see if everything loads up in the configurator? then go stage by stage. Here's how I built mine - installed the ESC board only, soldered the power leads, cap, motors, powered it, and got the ESC beep installed FC, connected power, got the ESC beep and subsequent beeps commanded by the FC  then went on soldering all other compoenents one by one, and tested at each stage","Didnt think of that, I will go try a figure it out, thanks You should get a smoke stopper, cause if you for exemple have the xt60 soldered the wrong way (- to + and vice versa) well, none of the components will like that very much if you don't have something like a tvs diode on the fc, and a vifly smoke stopper saved me from that a few times already. And you should use a smoke stopper when you first plug in your quad even if everything should be good"
"Hey, has anyone made experiences with Emax's lipos breaking really quickly? im handling them with care, but one of the cables always comes a bit loose in the connector on my Tinyhawk 3 freestyle, and then puffs up, is it sth im doing wrong or are the lipos just bad?. (im using the 650mAh 1s lipos)","Well, emax batteries aren't exactly good (plus you have the stupid double ph2.0) and if it puffs up, it's that you need to retire it very fast yeahh, it stopped working after that :loudly_crying_face: Yeah well the other possibility was that the lipo would go kaboom ill have to find a solution for the ph2.0 connector, dont have a soldering iron tho :/ Get a soldering iron. It will be really useful more than once in this hobby The tinyhawk quads can readily be converted to 2s lipos by switching the power lead for an xt30. You'd need a new charger though"
"do you have a good video tutorial on how to do that? ive never soldered anything before, is it do-able without destroying the drone, cause i really dont have money for a new one, lmao. or are there any Vtx30 to 2-ph2.0 adapters, that would be a lifesaver. would [this](https://www.banggood.com/de/URUAV-XH4S-or-6S-Connecter-XT60-Plug-to-PH2_0-Plug-for-1S-Lipo-Battery-p-1801328.html?utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=cpc_organic&gmcCountry=AT&utm_content=minha&utm_campaign=aceng-pmax-at-de-pc&currency=EUR&cur_warehouse=CN&createTmp=1&ID=6301687&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc_us&utm_content=izzie&utm_campaign=cceng-pla-moto-caxx-hotsku2405-06top10-C1-2024607&ad_id={{ad.id}}&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2Je1BhAgEiwAp3KY74bye_ZLjyqffFUeWAN2vtTsxxFeQtZP2jq3-PAHxzgh7o7QeAFqkxoC7WsQAvD_BwE) one work?","You just need to chop off the lead and solder on the xt30 connector, simple as that, you just need to make sure the polarity is right (square side is the red/positive side, rounder side is the black/negative side) If you want a tutorial, go watch Joshua Bardwell's on soldering"
could i also just strip the wires and solder that onto an xt30 connector?. or is that a worse option?,"Well, you need to remove the dual ph2.0 (chop it off) then you strip the wires then you solder the xt30"
"What options ? Like if you selected a different xt30XXX ? The XXX doesn't matter much, they are all compatible","like if i strip the wire and solder that onto an xt30 connector, or if i remove the soldering directly on the drone to solder the xt30 wires onto it, or i could just make a custom adapter i guess... i kinda dont want to solder directly on the drone, so i think making an adapter or stripping the wire and exchanging  the connector would be safer Don't make a custom adapter, the ph2.0 has a very high resistance and actually makes the quad fly worse, a lot worse, and reduces your flight time significantly, and you should just splice in the xt30, no need to solder on the aio"
"alright, thank you so much! so i just do essentially what this guy did right? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABs1MmMMidw","Pretty much, tho you don't really need the cramp thingy to strip the wires, just use your finger nails alrightyy, thankss :)"
"Hi again (total noob here btw), does is matter what color of cable do I use for my Rx? The tutorial which I'm following says I should use yellow, but in the package, it came green. Does it matter if its green or yellow? (I have RadioMaster RP1 )","Don't worry, electricity isn't racist. We just use different colors so it's easier No, though having a color code helps a lot. Basically don’t use black and red for anything besides ground and power, and only use black and red for ground and power Like we do black for negative voltage, yellow for tx, white for Rx, red for positive voltage For exemple Just makes soldering easier Black is ground red is power Yea, I thought that it doesnt make differnce, but wanted to make sure. Thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
"> serial.serialutil.SerialException: Cannot configure port, something went wrong. Original message: OSError(22, 'The parameter is incorrect.', None, 87). I tried flashing ELRS and got this error. this means I have to download some drivers right?","There's literally no point to this. It adds more weight to an underpowered quad, and only adds more resistance further degrading performance. alright, yeah i think ill just chop off the ph2.0 and solder on the xt30"
"oh, btw does it matter which solder i use, or are they all the same?","60/40 or 63/37 rosin core solder, a flux pen, a brass sponge, and either a solder sucker or solder wick"
"Sry, I meant ESC. I have stack from speedybee and can't locate basically any pad that you just mentioned. I assume that I cut of the smart audio and one of the GND completely, 5v goes to 5v, gnd to gnd, but which goes to CAM (video-in or video-out)?","Eh, ESC means Electronic Speed Controller, it's not the flight controller, it's only the bit that powers the motors. You *also* have a second board that's called the fc where you solder all that. (Or else you have an aio which I assume you don't) I have this board, I already soldered on VTX and Rx, all thats left is to connect the camera to I believe these 3 pads"
eachine tx06 is a VTX+camera combo. do you also have a separate VTX?. @50ShadowsOfBlack,"Yes, I do have speedybee tx800"
why do you have two VTX's?,"The TX06 is VTX+Camera. this is a TX06 Ok, now I understand. Yea, I'm should have done more research you should've asked before buying. but whatever. I wonder how you'll mount that camera.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. anyway TX06 -> Speedybee 5V, GND, Video Out -> 5V, G, CAM  Video In and SmartAudio is for the integrated VTX, so you'll ignore those.   Second ground is redundant, you can ignore it. It came with my fpv goggles for just $10, so I thought thats a steal and have some what decent camera for a low prize"
"You definitely didn't buy EV100 goggles, right?. Because everyone you've asked told you that they're terrible and told you the litany of issues with them",Unfortunately I went on a budget and purchased exactly these
Lemme guess. you bought a B6 battery charger too?. and zop batteries?,"Well I went though bunch of review and thought thought that it wont be that bad. nah, didnt bought that"
"So, tell me, what is the very common issue with reviews?. in pretty much any hobby/etc","I know that very well, but still I'm just a beginner so that dont want to dump all my money into something, that maybe will ended dead on a shelf The fact that most reviewers take a look at the product for a couple hours and then don't continue to use it because they already own something much better."
"So, you bought stuff that's pretty much impossible to resell for any kind of value, instead of buying things that (at least partially) keep their value :Harold:. and don't spontaneously combust. I won't keep pushing it... it's just.. frustrating. what charger did you buy?. Just so that I can warn you if that is a known fire hazard as well.","well since I plan on making my own attachments to the drone, I dont need any expensive equipment. Im not looking to make money off my drone"
"all im asking if I do solder the camera as you mentioned, will it work?!",If you tell me what charger you bought I'll answer that.
"Hi, just wondering if its worth it to get an xt30u connector over the xt30 , im gonna be using 2s batteries, does it make a big difference?","mate what are you talking about, first of all I didnt buy any charger"
What battery charger are you going to use?. I've been in this hobby for many years so I can tell from memory which ones are known fire hazards.,"dont know, will figure it out, when I need to, right know, its not an issue I have Since you already bought things which are fire hazards, I want to make sure that you don't light your room on fire. because that's already happened several times. well whatever. witht he wiring I described, you'll get camera video into the FC. the FC adds OSD onto the video signal. and outputs it on the VTX pad, for the VTX to take care of. you're practically ignoring the VTX on the TX06, but it will still be running in some sort of capacity"
"Bro, I bought 5inch frame along with speedybee f405 stack, radiomaster rp1 and speedybee tx800, do you really this its gonna set on fire?!","The EV100's are a known fire hazard. the goggles themselves can overheat and go up in smoke (seen that in person, lol)  and the included battery has extremely questionable circuitry. >  speedybee f405 stack, radiomaster rp1 and speedybee tx800, this is actually reasonably good stuff, and thank god you went ELRS. Frankly, I expected flysky.  The TX800 is a good, albeit slightly fragile VTX. The Speedybee FC has some known flaws - the USB port breaks off VERY VERY easily!! oh w8 I confused the name of my goggles. I have ev800dm Okay, not a fire hazard anymore... thank god. they're a bit worse than the EV800D's, but, not that big of a tragedy. EV100's are the goggles that normally ship with TX06. didn't know they started doing that with EV800DM's too Yea xd, I was like that are you on about, these are perfecly fine and now I realized I meant totally something else. I really couldnt decide between ev800d and ev800dm, they should be imporved, but who knows"
"EV800DM are manufacturing-cost-reduced EV800D's. You're not getting anything extra. the manufacturer is just spending less. okay you get adjustable lens... but that's it xD. anyway. You're still missing a battery charger, batteries (and a radio? not on the list)","I ordered them from banggood and say that I can get camera for $10, since its now a very popular camera, I didnt find many tutorial/arciles about it, so I just order it and now I was like, what the hell is going on with this U is a tiny bit lighter that's it afaik well I dont have a charger yet, because there are two types of the same batteries that go in to my contoller"
What radio did you get?,"I ordered 3.7V 18650 and it just didint fit in, then I found out that there is 1 company that makes them a little bit bigger. I got radiomaster pocket There are lots of companies that make them a little bit bigger cause they're stupid. I had to trim my 18650's lol. to fit in my pocket. the pocket can charge batteries, so that's not a big issue So I assume I need to go to local shops and try them in person I bought button-top 18650's and they didn't fit because they were flat tops with an extra button top soldered on top.  I ripped off the button top and now they fit.. Unprotected flat tops are what you want It was funny when I came to a shop that sells vapes and was like, ayo you got these batteries and instead of pulling vape I pulled out the controler. yea I bought that and it didnt fit (or I believe they didint have that, not sure right now) Learning in a sim is always good. Like, there is no detriment.   As for the radio, TX16S is a great pick ofc, but it's rarely needed for newbies. A much cheaper RM Pocket would do just as good of a job.  But, many have started flying without learning in a sim. I would be a hypocrite if I didn't mention it.  If you want to start flying irl, you should get something small, light, safe and durable.  That pretty much leaves you with indoor and outdoor whoops.. Any normal (unprotected) flat tops should fit, but it's still pretty tight Well I dont think it matters right now, they work and I was able to learn how to fly on a simulator"
"Last quick question: I think I got scammed. Bought a frame but now sure if its from carbon, becase it looks like there are layers that very much look like its 3d printed. So is it a scam or is it normal?","pics. carbon fiber is typically made out of layers of woven strands I just havent bought a charger yet, but luckily got the correct lipos"
Do you know what you'll be buying?. And what manufacturere made the correct lipos? :face_with_tears_of_joy:,"ok nice, wasnt sure bc it looks 3d printed but doesnt look like it so I was really confused it's pretty simple carbon fiber is A HECK OF A LOT stiffer than anything you can 3D print golisi. no, not at all I'm asking about the drone lipos okay, good stuff. not the best longevity, but you'll smash them to bits before you run  into that issue. Trust me, don't buy expensive lipos for your first flights. *experience* drones are like bread. they fall on the batteried side. lots of pancaked batteries battered is ***RIGHT THERE COME ON*** The only thing that drives me mad is that I forgot to buy smoke stopper and now I'm really afraid to plug it in I'M LITERALLY FALLING ASLEEP WHILE WRITING. send pics of your wiring. and build overall. we'll tell you how likely it is to blow up. BY THE WAY carbon fiber is electrically conductive. a lot of people miss that little fun fact I already put it aside and will continue probably tommorow, but I have a friend who basically solders all sorts of thing his whole life and he said its fine on another note, I've seen drone frames light on fire from the electricity running through them on yet another note, I've seen stack mounting screws glowing cherry red he also helped me with soldering, but still, I want to be sure and you have a server full of people who learned how stuff needs to be built either through studying or by doing it the wrong way first. poor soldering is only one potential issue Thats  what I like about it, I went into with a mindset that it wont go as I imagine and will propably mess up really quickly. I had to resolder basically the whole FC"
"and I've been through the ""my friend told me it's fine, what are you talking about, no it won't catch on fire"" scenario a couple times *care to know how most of those ended up?*. Like, if your friend builds FPV drones, then sure. If they don't then pls get it checked here as well","xd, well I really do believe him, he does it for a living so i think he knows"
does he build stuff in carbon fiber frames?. does he deal with RF video transmitters?,"probably cause he knew that like there are some issues which are pretty specific to this hobby. even something like mounting the VTX antenna wrong can end up increasing your chance of a fire by 50%. wrong motor screw lenghts.. fire. compressing the stack too much... fire. I'm not asking you to post the pics now. just, eventually. before you plug it in yea I get it, I was just saying that I firstly had issues with soldering, thats all and I dont think its a bad idea to buy a smoke stopper just to be sure Oh sure, buy a smoke stopper. it *helps*. tho it very often doesn't actually save everything. if you send 9V to a 3.3V tolerant pin, it will go pop, stopper or no stopper A smoke stopper helps with the really egregious stuff. like shorting battery leads directly to frame. Imma tell you a short story A guy bought a StarF4S (old FC + ESC aio).  He was trying to build a really short stack, to have the drone as light as possible.   He mounted the StarF4S so low that the USB port touched the carbon fiber frame.  He also used metal screws to mount the StarF4S to the frame.   Then, he plugged in the battery, and the frame caught on fire.. the StarF4S also caught on fire. and the screws and USB port glowed red. That revision of the StarF4S, for some unbelievably idiotic reason, had the plating in the mounting holes connected to Battery  positive (+). so, battery positive -> stack screws -> frame -> USB port shielding - aka GND - aka battery negative -> back trough FC -> battery negative. was a sight to behold. Just saying, shit is not always what it seems like at first glance in this hobby :face_with_tears_of_joy:. A modern common mistake is people connecting ELRS receivers to VCC instead of 5V damn, to be honost, fire is my biggest fear when it comes to my drone, I dont care if I lost it somewhere in a tree or i never find it, just dont want it to catch on fire yeah, sorta same, that's why I'm a bit paranoid. heck I'm more worried about helping someone and being indirectly involved a fire case. than my own shit catching on fire. well anyyyway. I'm no longer capable of reading long sentences. so imma go sleep I feel the opposite   I'd rather watch it catch fire than lose it I'd rather not have it burn or lose it, since it will get broken before either of those happen anyways"
Well if you had to pick only from those 2 options   What would you pick ?,"I would pick fire cause it would make a cool video and anecdote, and that if my quad burns I can rename myself ""Aymeric(burning quad)"" which is much cooler than ""Aymeric(I lost my quad to the trees, again)"" Burning ESCs is a fun activity   I remember doing that during my first times :see-no-evil_monkey: I like to burn batteries instead, that's how all my batteries end. I just tickle them with a knife when they get old this sounds like a fun thing to take out of context"
Does anyone have experience with the HQ props for Avata 2?,"guys. i bought this drone. and if i make the drone go up it just flies on a side. i dont know how to calibrate it why did you buy that drone. !toy. it screams ""cheapest plastic factories had to offer"" nvm i calibrated it. plus it has 2 displays"
"Hi, because of my poor research I bought two VTXs, I have my speedybee tx800 and a camera with VTX on it. Can I cut off the antenna on this camera?",better than having no cap
"I assume you intend to replace the antenna with something else? Or, what's your plan here?","I assume, they want to take the video from the aio and use a diff vtx I heard the cable should be as short as possible. yes, that's true. but having a cap on wires is better than not having it at all For sure. Gonna risk it for now Well I already have my other VTX (speedybee tx800) soldered to ESC and yesterday I found out, that this camera also has VTX, so I want to get rid off the one thats on the camera. You'd have to completely remove it by cutting all of the pins, and then resolder power and signal wires to the camera itself, but that still leaves you with the issue of mounting that camera. And I *know* those cameras, none of them are good quality"
"The C-rating on a battery describes how much current the battery is supposed to be able deliver *as a multiple of its capacity.* So, you have a ""120C"" battery that's 650mAh, then in theory it should be able to deliver up to 0.65A * 120 = 78A. A battery with a higher C-rating will not *push* that current, that's not how electricity works, so it won't fry anything just by being plugged in.  I say ""in theory"" because 1) Emax batteries are actually garbage masquerding as lipos and 2) C-ratings are universally close to bullshit. Manufacturers will inflate the hell out of the C-rating on a battery because ""bigger number better"". You can *mostly* use them to compare offerings from the same manufacturer (for example, you could expect a Tattu 70C battery to perform better than a Tattu 30C pack), but that's about it. The best you can do is get packs of known quality from a known manufacturer/brand. Can you send me a link to the camera you bought so I can see the pinout myself?","ohh alright makes sense, thank youu  i was comparing these two batteries: [1](https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/batterie-lipo-2s-650mah-150c-serie-ucell-dogcom-12447.html)  [2](https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/tattu-650mah-2s-75c-lipo-battery-xt30-2237.html) Yea see, I know just from a decade in the hobby that that 150C number is absolutely crap, and honestly I'd expect either of these batteries to perform about the same alrightyy, yeah thats why i asked, better to get recommendations from experienced people, lol, tysm! the tattu ones are a lot older. 150C is probably just marketing, but Dogcom has really nice batteries"
would you say theyre overall better than the Tattu ones?. theyre a bit cheaper too so that would be cool,"I would trust them a bit more, and I prefer how they look as well"

You don't have to connect anything else. *However*, you very much *should not* clip off the antenna on this. If you do, it will burn out the VTX, and since the VTX is *also providing power to your camera*, burning it out deliberately would be a bad idea. Fortunately it only broadcasts at 25mW. So, what you do is, use the button to set this VTX to a channel that is *as far as possible* from the channel your other VTX will be operating on. I typically recommend that people fly on R8 if you're flying alone, so if you set your other VTX to R8, you would set this one to R1"
"Alright, and do I assume correctly that it does not matter wich gnd I use?","It shouldn't, but you can always use a multimeter to double-check continuity between the two GND pins to ensure they are a common ground Alright, thank you. I just wanted to get rid off the antenna since its sticking out, but as you said, I should leave it there, thanks"
"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) did you fix your avatar goggles, did they break because you got a v1 and it overheated?",no overheating issues can always be fixed. mine are broken in a very unique way why did you pick them over dji
How are they broken ?,"GSNR is max 16. and I get smearing, which isn't normal. cheaper and pretty much better in every way other than slightly worse penetration Oh yeah that, no idea what GSNR means but yeah I remember you had range issues a while back I wouldn't have ever bought DJI FYI, just from morals. I would've gone HDZero if Walksnail didn't exist"
is EMF a worry at all with high powered digital goggles?,"i saw some people talking on forums about some early scientific evidence it could cause some level of neurodegeneration heh no that's not a thing. 5.8GHz will never be able to do that no matter what A lot of those studies are hilariously bad the 5G has already installed three microchips in my brain, the goggles can only manage to do a small one which can barely show one mind ad per day its easy to make fun of but see asbestos and microplastics, unless we can say yeah no that's 100% not a thing due to physics, it makes me a lil uncomfortable if you have wifi at home you're probably at no higher risk It is 100% not a thing so long as you don't stick your head in a microwave and put it at 1000w in this case it is not a thing due to how RF works, and this is a very well-studied field as opposed to those scary things people seem to worry more about dji which both transmit and recieve Walksnail does the same, and neither will melt your brain and have it leaking out of your ears at this frequency it's kind of like worrying that sound is degrading your brain directly There are more people that fly DJI drones, so there is more population overlap between DJI drone fliers and EMF conspiracy theorists. That's a form of selection bias It’s not ionizing radiation so the most it can do is slightly warm your forehead, and it’s a couple watts at most, so it will barely even do that. If radiation at reasonable levels was a problem, we'd never stick anyone in an MRI radiation is a seperate issue from EMF, im not worried about non-ionising radiation Human-made EMF *is* non-ionizing radiation though. We aren't sending gamma rays Non-ionizing is a part of the EM spectrum, which is entirely based on power and frequency. Basically everything lower than ~~gamma~~ X rays is ""non-ionizing"" If the Facebook server you take your info at is called ""lizard Jesus is real"" then it's not a good source Perhaps they were worried about it inducing currents that affect the electrochemical signals but that’s not really a thing afaik this is unnecessary, just stay away if you're going to make comments like this its not ""conspiracy"" to look into educating yourself about a potential danger, once again see asbestos and microplastics. No doubt people flagging potential issues in those days were also laughed out of the room ^ because this is what happens. pointless bickering There’s a reason all the tech to stimulate nerve action requires physical contact with the nerves low/mid freq emf is clearly not super dangerous but maybe some level of constant exposure is, i think if someone could lay out some numbers of the walksnail system and what equivalent levels of exposure im under everyday via wifi etc it would persuade me of its safety a lot more there's not really any exposure. it doesn't even really touch you at all, they're low frequency signals. and in the grand scheme of everything around you, walksnail is literally nothing. even compared to your phone"
"Let's forgo that for a moment, and assume that the Walksnail system *isn't* safe. If Walksnail isn't safe, then it's not unreasonable to assume that *no* FPV system is safe, and there is no working around that. What do you do then?","I mean, if walksnail isn't safe because of the tx inside, it's not just that no *fpv* system is safe, but that litteraly none of the items with a wireless connection we use every day is safe"
wouldnt analog be a lot safer?,you move to the alaskan wilderness
lower freq and less power?,"Same frequency same power Everything operates on 5.8GHz my friend Just not a tx in the goggles, it's really the only difference that's relevant here. There is still some sattelites above you hey I picked alaska for a reason. the more north the better"
yeah and theres only a tx in dji right?,"Let's go to the north pole and build a floating anti rf nation then, we only have to figure out how to also remove the rf from space, such as light and other cosmic rays hell yeah rimworld time Walksnail also has one inside. Only hdzero and analog don't have an rf inside. But as we exposed multiple times, neither will fry your brain We're getting lost in the weeds of what is, ultimately, a risk/reward conversation. RF risk is a matter of *cumulative* exposure. *No* consumer device operates at such a power level that would cause acute damage, and if you consider *as a percentage of your entire lifetime* the number of minutes you spend with the goggles strapped to your face, you'd realize the statistical hilarity of them ever causing ~~cancer~~ any health issue at all yeah but cancers not the only thing to worry about here. also i realise most people go about and do a lot more damage in other activities so its not a concern for 99% of people You're asking about whether or not you're going to die of liver failure because you have one drink a couple times a month Then substitute cancer with any other rf related disease or whatever else, 2.4ghz and 5.8ghz is really safe, in fact we even had a study a while back on the effect of 2.4ghz (which microwaves use) on the human body and at the end, I forgot the actual quote but they basically said that they would consider using 2.4ghz to replace their heaters I'm really, sincerely, not trying to demean your concern. I'm just trying to highlight the minute nature of it No I appreciate the information. I'm legitimately asking btw, not trying to argue for the sake of it If you're genuinely concerned about it, you should probably consult a physician. Obviously we are not doctors No I'm just kinda into longevity stuff so I like to take a close look at everything I do The only real concern I *maybe* could have is if you are - I believe it's rf hypersensitivity or something like that, I think the acronym is EHS, which might give you a slight headache if you fly for a while, afaik it hasn't been scientifically proven but placebo can be really strong sometimes, not to say the symptoms don't exist"
"do i have to have any concerns about the vtx overheating or something? im looking at how many batteries to buy rn, how many packs would i be able to fly with safe temperatures, or do i not really have to pay attention to that and can just get like 10 and fly a bunch in one sitting?","yeah absolutely you can. stuffs air cooled, if it's getting too hot you're just flying too slow so far ive never really noticed elevated temperatures but ive only flown 2 packs in one sitting so far. lol, fair enough"
You mean warcrime sim?,"hey now, that's on you. all I do is uh. different unspeakable horrors that aren't yet a warcrime The jurry is still out on weather or not the legless skin hat factory is war crime territory yet I'll never look at a company's Human Resources department the same Now i need to start a new ~~organ farm~~ colony tonight, there goes getting a reasonable amount of sleep today"
What's the bad ESC protocol now?,"Uhhh for protocol anything besides DShot is useless. If you mean firmware, BLHeli32 is out, and AM32 is in"
"Ah yes firmware, ok so is BLheli32 still ok or should I avoid it?","if you have it, use it but buying new BLHeli_32 ESCs would just be shooting yourself in the foot Eh that isn't too bad unless you know how to work with an external flasher That would be a big no. I hate firmware and software in general you can't update BLHeli_32 ESCs anymore. If one you buy comes with the various different unsafe firmware versions, you're SOL you can't even change the settings. it's absurd"
I thought that only flashing was limited. you can't even access the config?,I'm 99% sure you can't do anything at all
"In what cases would I use a capacitor on my drone, and what measurement would I typically use?","Pretty much always unless it's a tinywhoop As for measurement, the voltage rating should be 1.5x your max battery voltage *at minimum*, ideally more like 2x. Capacitance also is variable. I like 440uF for 3.5"" or smaller, and 1000uF for anything bigger You can still change settings, you just need to use the Configurator version that matches the firmware version installed"
"Sup boys, could this be ""slow"" mode with sticks for a rookie with a tinywhoop?. Geprc smart 16",I'd answer but y'know
"i have absolutly no clue at all, theese are setting from previous owner. Should i try to match the number to each row?","no, don't touch that. those aren't the rates go to the 2nd tab. and screenshot the rates. i mean ,thats kinda fast for a whoop i a 100% first drone rookie jeez yeah 1k rates are really only good if you know you want that. give it like 600 you could set center stick a bit lower, and set max to like 500-700 I mean... I do fly 900/900/1000, but that's only cuz I'm used to that. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone First drone havent really flew anything expo could also be a bit lower too for a smoother transition"
lets say stickcenter 600?,"id personally set it to like 130 center sensitivity, 650 and 0.8 expo but youll see if you like it when you fly your drone"
"yea ofc, but leaving from home and wanna try :p. stick center maybe at 100, max rate 600? and expo 0.8?. better lower then to high i guess?",yeah that sounds about fine i rather fly and be slow then quick rates and go down. ._. that looks more like what you would want i gotta try but still clueless thanks for heading me in right direction
"Hi, I have an issue with the O3 system. For some reason, sometimes when I plug the lipo the video transmission is blocky and super low quality, worse than analog, as you can see in the video. Other times, I plug the lipo and everything looks great, but I can't seem to understand what's the issue... it's more random than anything. Any idea on what could be happening?","Check if your antenna is plugged in correctly, I didn't have it plugged in correctly once and I had the same thing except the picture is so dark Ok, lemme check. They seem fine to me :/ It says right on the video. > Air unit in low-power state. You could also just be too close that's really strange but somehow it must have to do with the connection because you have 0 mbits I'm new to the DJI system, but it's always in that state at the beggining. Yep exactly It doesn't really matter, it always does that it doesn't get too hot"
Is that still the case when you arm it?,"I haven't tried it,  I just arm it when the transmission is good enough I don't think so, but just give it a try. Try this it does matter here. yes, it can OK, lemme re-assemble it and test it out It's also a good idea to check the MIPI cable and see if your firmwares match Yep, checked the MIPI also and seems to be properly fitted. I updated the firmware for the goggles and O3 first thing. That's really strange, maybe the antenna or even the whole air unit is broken Well it's working now... not sure"
soo.. i already opened a thread about this.. but is it bad that im getting an rssi dbm warning all the time.. does this look normal? just wanna get some opinions on this.. :crying_cat:   (flying a: tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle rtf kit)  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5b2nrob2u4fayoqcdzppl/rssi_dbm_warning.mp4?rlkey=jgzgldy1eg4j062ajnsqhn2x2&st=zq8g695x&dl=0,put the dBm and link quality on your OSD
yeah i did... havent flown since two. isnt the link quality the bottom right one?,"like the controls didnt feel off or anything, but im concerned abt getting the warning all the time don't know why you have it set to 150Hz. but add the dBm, it's important. <https://www.expresslrs.org/info/signal-health/>. can't say anything without it"
i just set my alarm to -110 (was -60 before)  ``` # get osd_rssi_dbm_alarm ###WARNING: NO CUSTOM DEFAULTS FOUND### osd_rssi_dbm_alarm = -60 Allowed range: -130 - 0  # set osd_rssi_dbm_alarm=-110 osd_rssi_dbm_alarm set to -110 # get osd_rssi_dbm_alarm ###WARNING: NO CUSTOM DEFAULTS FOUND### osd_rssi_dbm_alarm = -110 Allowed range: -130 - 0 Default value: -60 ``` could the alarm value have been too high or sth?,-60 is way too high yeah. I'd set it to -90 or -85
"alright, in the cli on BF when i changed a value, do i need to press any of these buttons to save it?","It's as shrimple as that Yeah, maybe it was just a slightly loose cable... Because I've been testing it several times in the office, sometimes with the goggles very close and very far, with the same positive outcome"
"hey, btw idk if anyone else here has tinyhawks (or if this only happens with whoops or so), but even when my battery is fully charged and i take off, i get the battery low signal. how am i supposed to tell when my battery is actually low?  ive enabled the voltage per cell element on the osd but it doesnt really tell me much more, since if i give it more throttle it also just goes down the exact same as the Battery voltage osd element","I have my dji integra on the latest firmware, and I noticed that my o3 units have the option to record on takeoff, but my runcam link wasp doesn't have this option in the camera menu. From madtechs video this should be a option with thr latest firmware Well, if the voltage drops a lot on takeoff (i.e takeoff at 4.2v and they directly drop to 3.5v) it just means the batteries are cooked, and you can't just change it in software, they are just old, so it's time to get new ones (and to chop off that double ph2.0 if you have it, and replace it with an xt30, then get some nicer xt30 gnb batteries) damn.. those were new batteries shipped with my drone... that sucks. yeah im gonna exchange the ph2.0 for xt30 next week just need all the parts to arrive. i can send you a video rq, if you wanna see what i mean.. so you can more accurately tell me if the batteries are cooked, lol If you want to, you can"
"And if you charge them to 4.2 like you should before flying, what happens ?","can u. just upload it here no cause the vid is too big the charger that came with it is just like a shitty usb charger with 6 ports, i left them to charge for like 30 minutes or so to make sure, then i used them, that was the first video.. <https://litterbox.catbox.moe/> like i think they were fully charged tbh smack it on here even Well that's not how you charge batteries. Even on crappy chargers there should be a led or something that lights up when it's full oh yeah there was an LED, but it was just permanently green... even when i just finished flying But you should get a real charger, and the sag is mainly because of the *emax quality* yeahh.. ik, i ordered new stuff, i just got the rtf kit to start out cus i knew nothing and saw some good video reviews about it, i have xt30 connectors, a vifly toothstor and whoospstor v3 and some 2s batteries on the way but its really annoying, that with a new RTF kit, the batteries are lowkey ass. the drone is solid tho ngl yeahh cant wait to use 2s batteries and get away from ph2.0, its such a pain in the ass Yeah, cause you have both the shitty emax lipos and the ph2.0 for an exquisite mix RTF kits are just bad sadly. all the good reviews were paid i mean.. the drone and googles are pretty good so far, the radio is.. usable, the only thing i have problems with are the batteries. ive seen a bunch of... i  think credible drone youtubers say good stuff about the Tinyhawk 3 freestlye.. so i thought it wouldnt be that bad of a buy you think they're good until you try something good :p. I doubt they're credible yeahh probably, lol. well now i know a lot more about drones already.. soo at least i have sth to fly in the meantime, lol. yeahh probably, the limiting factor for me is money and experience tbh, this is my very first drone that i got like 5 days ago.. so yeah. hoping to learn a lot more. this discord is actually insanley helpful, like id be so lost without it.. appreciate the help, tyy!!"
"What do you want to get next?. the general starter kit recommended here is 300 dollars and it's about as packed as it gets. RadioMaster Pocket ELRS, EV800D (not comfortable), any tinywhoop (Meteor75?), ViFly Whoopstor, Tattu 5-pack.","probably a radiomaster zorro.. or tx16s and a 3 inch drone, i think ill keep the goggles tho , i like hdzero you just listed the two ""dated"" transmitters lol i mean those seem good. tx16s seems to be pretty popular. lol They're older and not comfortable. TX16S is huge in a way you don't need if you're only flying copters. RadioMaster Boxer, Pocket, Jumper T15, T20 are the newer style radios that are the most popular ohh alright. yeah ill probabyl upgrade my drone and radio soon, i dont think the goggles are too bad tho (emax transporter 2 hdzero) it's fine being hdzero. unless you want to spend 550 dollars ive only flown my drone 3 times but it didnt feel that bad, tbf i only have like 100 hours in sims but yeah i mean.. thats not THAT much that is THAT much. most people never get that much in the sim"
"wait fr? i thought that people usually get a bunch of hours. damn. idk ive really enjoyed flying in there, id say im not that bad at freestlye in the sim","naw I got like 10 and was like ""alright not touching this again"""
"do you want to do BNF?. 200 dollars is really tight when you consider the price of a HDZero unit, you'd most likely be looking at another tinywhoop","idk how to solder :loudly_crying_face: it's super easy to learn yeahh.. ive heard that, but ill probably get into that later on... as long as you get good gear, it'll take you like 20 minutes to make competent solder joints. 60 dollars~ is all you need. even though it's a bit old, I'd probably get the Crux35 HDZero"
"i honestly like the look of the acrobee drones, are those any good?",no anything NBD is a scam. like their products are nothing but proprietary scams sadly down to weird OSD firmware for no reason
is betaFPV better than emax?. like in terms of manufacturing quality and stuff,"yes and no. they both make scummy products aimed for beginners. like the RTF kits. but their stuff aimed towards hobbyists is generally quite good lol yeah i kinda picked up on that. oh, i see, so they get more serious as people are more serious with the hobby, lmao yuppp. Happymodel is nice, although recently their newly released AIO has been a dumpster fire which is really strange coming from them. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/546421137077305398/1241829322692493423"
ELRS? no. HDZero and Walksnail? yes. most people who have those systems tend to build themselves. are you from Europe?,"yupp. yeah, ill probably get a few bnf to get the hang of it and then start building stuff once i buy a soldering iron you're gonna need that iron to repair :p i thought  that would be the case.. i have a friend who has a soldering iron, he'll show me how it works and then ill get my own probably, i also wanna replace the battery connector on my current tinyhawk, so ill need it for that I'm always terrified of. ""I have a friend who knows how to solder"". because 9/10 times it turns out like #diwhy he has actually soldered electronics before, like keyboards, etc.. that does not look good, lol, but i probably couldnt do it better than my friend anyway yeah you easily can. 90% of soldering is having good gear. things like keyboards are easier than quadcopters mostly because of how stuff is designed"
which ones are decent?,"ESC's need very good heat transfer with a nice tip, FC pads are absolutely miniscule. TS100's and derivatives are good. and the cheapest. Hakko stations, Weller stations is all okay too. Pinecil is most recommended, I think It's 25 dollars on their site with like 10 dollars shipping on top."
this one? https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/,"Or do i have to buy a battery like the goggles 2 yup. Power supply can be a good phone charger, or a quad battery. i think it has a built in one Get a m2 screw too if you don't have any lying around Then you'd want to combo it with a tip like a TS-BC2, 63/37 leaded no-clean solder (MG Chemicals, Stannol, Kester, TBS), brass tip cleaner (IT'S GOLD COLORED). you got trolled so hard I did :PepeSadge:. Luckily I found some screws that came with my micro drone y'know some people don't even use it. they just accept the risk of it falling out. and melting through the table Man fpv so damn expensive But worth it :PepeLove: i ordered 63/37 rosin core solder, i might actually solder it myself.. just using my friends tools, since he has an iron and a brass sponge and stuff you really need to make sure it's one of those brands or another popular one and not some no-name chinese mix. it's super crucial, as they often don't use the correct metals or flow properly I'm really thinking of selling my 1s lite transmitter for one that will properly fit my frame i ordered this one: https://www.team-blacksheep.com/products/prod:tbs_solder_100g_08 my barometer doesnt seem to be working and im not sure why. I configured it to be 12c and tried device 1 and 2, im on betaflight 4.5.1 and this is the device im using https://pyrodrone.com/products/geprc-gep-m10-dq-gps-module-1 I mean you don't really need a barometer, especially in Betaflight but.... <https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/barometer#barometer-firmware-support> @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  do you know by chance if this is a good soldering iron, i usually look for stuff on this site cause they deliver the quickest in like central europe it's not great. it's a whole lot less comfy than the pinecil, and miniware is now known to ship with clone STM32 chips. also no usb-c. also that is a ridiculous price oh that sounds like a pain <https://dontasktoask.com/>. this site can be helpful"
"I know this is a stupid question but since I'm new to discord, can someone tell me how to send photos or videos?","In the box you type in there should be a little plus on the left or right you can open your explorer and drag it into the text field, or you can add it on the left of the text field at the plus I've just find it. Thanks"
btw..do you know where pine64.com ships from? i dont wanna have to pay VAT on top of shipping,"uuh that's the european site right. oooh. no. they ship from hong kong. they have a EU site too which is pretty pricey cool :). thats probably still worth it cause of shipping and VAT might be, might not be thats probably like 20+$ ontop definitely not. it's not. let's say you got Dutch tax, 21%. 21% on top of 25.99 I payed 30€ for 2 cables oh well, i live in Austria, idk how much it is exactly but i dont like VAT, thats for sure if they even will do it with how low value it is yeah its double the price.. damn yeah it's dumb. ordering from their HK site would cost you 31.188 + shipping. (if they do tax you) yeah i would pay 37.98 with shipping. it says $0.00 for tax but idk I'm assuming they'll write down the value as 22 euros or some shit so you don't get taxed it says this. sounds good i guess I mean. worst case, you lose 5 euros. best case, you keep your 5 euros"
One more question this might be dumb but for example  do you have to bind a tx16s  to goggles 3 or is it goggles + O3 air unit and only TX16S + elrs flight controller and that’s it?,My XT-60 connector broke yesterday and I bought a new one from Rhobby FPV. I paid little and it already arrived
is rhobbyfpv an italian site or some shit like that?. theres no english option :loudly_crying_face:,"this might be useful for ya'll. <https://fpvmarket.eu/> omg damn ,you with your magic sites. thats so cool. thank you. you really have a website for everything bookmarked, dont you, lol bookmarked in my brain"
So it goes TX16S+ ELRS flight controller and then Goggles 3 + O3 air unit?,"And you set with binding process. Then you can fly right Noice. Ty for help. Arigato Another nice site Is FPV24.com. Is german. But there's also english option oh thats nice, from germany they probably ship to austria quickly. i speak german so no problem lol"
How much's the nominal voltage?,"i think you have to discharge them to storing voltage or sth. i think you have to discharge them to 3.6V or so (dont trust me on this) the empty voltage of a LiPo cell is around 3.2-3.3V, the full is 4.2V. The nominal voltage is basically the 50% way through the charge cycle, around 3.7V thats for a lipo though. I believe li-ion is different"
"btw, while i dont have my whoopstor v3, how tf am i supposed to charge my batteries correctly with this peace of shit?","There's exist li-on batteries Who have 4,2 of nominal voltage for lipo max charge is 4.2v, storage is 3.8v and low end is 3.6-3.4v"
What air units work with integra goggles?,"yeah but the LED is green permanently, no matter what. how am i supposed to tell anything from it, lol O3 does for sure, let me look at the others those numbers are a bit off"
"oh ok, what is correct?","storage is usually done to nominal(-ish) levels. so 3.7V I have One of that and I had to throw away a new battery my smart charger takes it to 3.85 and the lowest is 3.2-3.3, but since the voltage drops of very quicky past 3.5V it's recommended to land at that point me too, it puffed up at first charge :crying_face: no to normal lipo. il double check. give me a sec"
ok so storage charging my 6s 1300mah lipo to 3.7 is most optimal?,"odd, but I suppose they're taking the 50% of the ""safe"" cycle (4.2-3.5V). 3.7-3.8V is good, doesn't need to be exact ye it has end voltage set at 3.85 integra should work with the vista (I think) and also the full air unit and O3 air unit"
is the osd preset still the best way to setup ws vtx units?,"My smart charger store my 4S at 3,6 per cells"
So would a caddx vista not work?,"he said it should work with the vista I'm pretty sure the vista does work with it. and I believe everything that the goggles 2 are compatible with also work for integra this is technically outdated. correct but outdated can you send the most updated one please no clue if it was even made but the goggles 3 are now compatible with the O3 airunit whats outdated about this then. oh I see are now*. they are now compatible wait that doesnt even make sense, why would their latest goggles not work with their lattest transmission system its not the latest. the avata 2 is O4 But the googles 3 Need the DJI RC 3 who tf has money for all the dji stuff tho oh i see, still doesnt make sense why they wouldnt make it work with O3 besides money grab maybe elon musk, idk who else tho of course they want a money grab they just recently released an update to make them compatible"
oh so O3 does work with goggles 3 then?,yep yep. I misspelled beforehand
ok I see. does goggles 3 work with the full air unit and vista?,Goggles 3 are not backward compatible with anything older than the O3 But you need to update the o3 and goggles 3 to the newest firmware update Yea they just released that like 2 days ago lol totally asinine that it took that long Guys i'm going sleep. Good night what no it was older then that. somebody with the goggles 3 sent it here like a week + ago
how long have goggles 3 been out? even since avata2?,they came out with the avata 2 I like how every new goggle they make has less and less features
what did they take away with the g3?,"I don't know but probably some bullshit. goggles 2 were BS enough also btw the type C to xt60 cable got here and it works very big yay. no need to carry PSU now. just my very bulky charger I sent the forum post to staff four days ago, so I was wrong, it was longer its fine. it still took DJI months to do the most basic thing ever Yea completely ridiculous that it wasn't backwards compatible on day 1 like sometimes I am like ""damn o3 looks nice"". but then I remember. shit like this happens I'm holding out for the next Walksnail system. As soon as it comes out I'll know which direction I'm marching in"
next?. as in VTX or new goggles?,Yea the new VRX that's supposed to be coming. Replacement for the VRX board in the current generation of goggles. Supposed to be better in every way
what will they upgrade?. btw the app is finally published,"Range, sensitivity, performance, quality, etc so easy to stream shit to people next to you. il have to get that. tho ngl the GX are kinda loud *I* am equally astonished that DJI haven't said *anything* about an O4 Air Unit, at least to my knowledge ye that is also super weird. ""look at this new drone with the NEW and improved o4 airunit"". then just ghosts"
"this might be a lowkey stupid question but can hdzero goggles only be used with hdzero drones, or is there some magical way i could connect it to a different drone?  im asking cause im looking at this 1s tinywhoop that i would buy of off someone but theres not much of a description (the drone is an APUS MQ60)","I am pretty sure there is an hdzero analog thing The HDZ goggles can be used with hdzero, and you can buy an expansion bay to plug an analog module (or via the av port) and you can also use the HDMI in with a walksnail vrx"
"so i can use my goggles with analog, hdzero and walksnail, right?","Yeah, you just need a walksnail/analog vrx as well damn so buying 2nd hand drones isnt very easy, with my setup.. i have an elrs controller and hdzero goggles :/"
Dumb question. What are the s1 and s2 knobs for on a controller used for?,"uhhh if you have planes you can use them for flaps n stuff. or just anything that requires fine control. like servos Cool, that's what I thought... Trim."
whats the max output power of hd zero..?,"You're asking about the Emax HDZ goggles, aren't you, not the *actual* HDzero goggles. There is a huge world of difference. The Transporter 2 HDzero goggles do not have any external inputs, and cannot be used with any FPV system besides HDzero.. I assigned one to be a global volume knob I have mine on vtx power"
"Depends on the vtx?. There are a couple, so if you could be more specific",I don’t own any hdzero so I was just curious. Feeling a lil bit of buyers remorse with Walksnail lol
Can anyone answer why the 4th motor is a little slow while arming?. And will the drone buzzer when it comes to 3.5v? :slightly_smiling_face:,It should flash on ur osd when it’s low. Just gotta setup that osd thing which is standard
and when just flying some without googles? could it be buzzering at low volts?,Umm it’s kinda difficult to fly an fpv drone without goggles. IMO and kinda hard with googles aswell for a total rookie haha Nah just gotta fly in the sim. literally no point of tryna learn to fly without goggles first then flying with. Just going to get false muscle memory
I read through the #frequently-asked-questions beginner's shopping list. Can anyone recommend a video or such with these items or that specific (build? loadout?). Just to have a feel of how FPV works? I'm a complete beginner and most things you look up consist of people doing it of many years with nearly top of the line stuff.,"OMG ! Can someone PLEASE point me in the right direction. I have a 5"" speedybee F7 and when I go to yaw, the dang thing wants to throttle up in the turn (scary as hell). I have made sure the ends points are set to 1000 to 2000, so I know thats not it. I have made sure its calibrated correctly. Oh and I did add expo.     I've tried so many different PID numbers *gosh dang it, I want to go slow NOT fast"
Does it settle down when you stop yawing?,slightest yaw and it yaw's ok but it also goes up. yes but but but. im to scared to even way because of the way its behaving. yaw not way. it cant be like that
"Just so I understand, it starts throttling up *during* the yaw move? Or does it ""jump"" as you *end* the yaw?","yes during the yaw mov. e. I can film it for you to show you what it looks like That could be helpful when I yaw you will see it throttle up........ok   brb Hey before you do that, make sure you have either the Throttle % or Stick Overlay OSD elements turned on"
"Oh awesome! Found some clips already showcasing the whole ordeal. From such a starter kit, how long can you usually fly with a single setup of batteries? Cause if I understand it correctly, there's a LiPo for the drone which you plug in (I come from Airsoft, so quite normal). And the headsets also battery operated or charged up. So for 1 charging time, how long do you expect usually to screw around till you gotta' go back and re-charge everything?","So, what I'm about to tell you is one of the reasons I *hate* that Emax elected to use 2 1S batteries instead of just using 2S batteries.  When you run two batteries together (either parallel or series), you are drawing from both packs equally. This is fine in instances where the packs are identical in *every* way, not just in spec, but also in health and life. This is important, because if you use two batteries where one of them is not as healthy as the other, it will drain faster, and could potentially end up draining all the way to 0V without you necessarily noticing. In addition, because it's connected to another, newer, healthier battery, it can also *potentially* kill the better battery as well (or at least cause *you* to accidentally kill it). So it's *always* recommended to use two *identical* batteries together, rather than mixing yup, the dual ph2.0 connector sucks ass, im gonna be switching to xt30 asap, i already ordered all the stuff :loudly_crying_face:  so you wouldnt recommend using it i suppose.."
Do you already have both batteries?,"You can certainly fly with them, I just advise using caution. The first couple times you fly, don't fly all the way to 650mAh. I would fly to, say, 450 or 500, then stop and unplug to check the battery condition alright, i guess ill try it, wont really have another option til my soldering iron and xt30 connector arrive Most FPV quadcopters that are of the freestyle/racing/performance spec (which all micros also happen to fall into, for reasons to do with physics of scale) fly for a few minutes under average conditions. I have a Mobula 6 that I get about 2.5-3 minutes on. I have 6 batteries that I charge with my Whoopstor. All lipos take about an hour to charge (1C, you're familiar), and with 6 batteries (plus time to swap and reset) I get about 20 minutes of fun well crap, saying the vid is to large to post here.....darn Just clip the part that's relevant"
"ive got a general question about batteries, so i use 1s 650mAh batteries rn, theyre at 3.8V.  when i disarm my quad at the end of a flight it says something around 2000 mAh used, what exactly does that mean? how many mAh can be used from a fully charged 650mAh battery? or how exactly is that being calculated?. or for example when i plug in my battery on BF it says mAh used  but it goes way above 650mAh","For the Tinyhawk, it's running two 1S batteries in *series* (clarified my post above). In series, you add voltages together, but you do not add capacity. It is not possible for you to draw 2000mAh from 650mAh packs, they would completely die long before that, so my only conclusion is that your betaflight amp scale is not configured correctly"
where would i configure that?,"sorry you can't see it that good, I know you probably can't tell but when I go to yaw, it JUMPS up Yes this is the correct tab, let me see if I can find the value. Interesting, 179 is the default value from Emax, but that's clearly not correct. Or, rather, it's not resulting in the correct behavior I'll be so glad when I get the to point that I'm able to wear my goggles. This is a very small amount of yaw jump, honestly. It probably feels like a lot because you're trying to fly in such a small space--far too small a space to reasonably fly a 5"" quad OK, that did cross my mind A little bit of jump is normal because of how the physics of quadcopters work. You'll never notice when you're flying FPV because *how* you move the quad will be different is there anything you see from my PID and other setttings (see above of pics of conf in betaflight) that could slow this down"
What’s the ideal kV for 6S 3.5” cinewhoops before I buy everything? Just want to double neck.,"hmm thats weird i might message emax support about that and ask for the correct values Just further reduce your yaw rate, but, again, this is very normal behavior and you're only seeing it because you're flying LOS. That's the thing, 179 *is* the correct default value"
"Also, how does https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/hqprop-cinewhoop-duct-3-props-clear-grey mount onto https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/axisflying-c206-2006-brushless-motor/ ?","ok, I'm gonna further reduce my yaw rate and see if that helps.   Thank you DaedalusFPV"
"What props do I need then? I just found out about threaded vs t mount, but I can’t find any ones on a site I’m trying to buy most my stuff off.","Looking at other 3.5"" cine builds it looks like the Kv tend to be in line with 6S 5"" recommendations, so 1700-2000. Probably have more room to push higher than you do on a 5"", like up to 2300 or 2400 https://www.getfpv.com/gemfan-d75s-ducted-3-blade-propeller-set-of-4-1-5mm.html I think these will work. Those are 3"" props, not 3.5"""
huh.. do you think sth else is misconfigured then or is there sth wrong with the drone? but the wrong config would also explain why on the osd it always showed way too low voltage,"There are good videos on Youtube showing you how you can recalibrate those values. It's not *complicated* but it's a lot to just type out alright thank you, ill take a look at that DaedalusFPV, OK, as you suggested,      I;m watching  Nick Burns"
What size bolt are on 2207 motors for propeller?,"M5. Yea voltage is a pretty simple one, current is more complicated. Oscar has a good article that I've used more times than I can remember https://oscarliang.com/current-sensor-calibration/ thankss, ill try to configute it It helps a lot if you have a wattmeter or a power supply so you can directly plug the quad into that and run up the motors and compare the values in real time"
How do you workout the size? Like the shaft diameter is 4mm but I don’t know how that correlates,"These are super cheap for how useful they are https://www.amazon.com/HTRC-Precision-Analyzer-Battery-Voltage/dp/B06XPVKY13/ref=mp_s_a_1_6_sspa Look up your motor and it's listed on the spec sheet. Every 2207 motor is uses an M5 nut because the shaft is 5mm. If you're measuring 4mm then most likely you're not measuring correctly, or you have a very weird motor Velox veloce v2207.5 V2. I looked it up on a place that sells them and it says 4mm I didn’t measure it myself That's dumb, idk why they'd do you dirty like that Idk I was just about to buy a pack since it says 4mm on every website I looked up Yea, one sec. I'm seeing that too. Looks like it's just a typo in T-motors documentation (which every retailer just copies), but it's 100% a 5mm shaft Alright thanks, you’ve just saved me a bunch of time :loudly_crying_face:. I had the 4mm nuts in the basket"
What settings should I use to charge this on a LiPo charger? https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/gnb-1100mah-6s-60c-lihv-battery-xt30. - Balance current: 800mA 4.2V - Charging power: 300W MAX 15A,"6S voltage, charge to 4.2V/cell, set current to 1.1A (1C) <https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/>. please read this. it has some info that could safe you from lighting your house on fire"
"That's part of the confusion. 8000mah x 10c =80,000? Which makes no sense.","might be Ah. 8Ah*10c = 80a 80,000mA is 80A. Don't forget unit conversion in the whole process. 'C' is actually a unit of flow rate, which is mA/hr (generally). So 1C is X mA / 1 hr where X is the battery capacity Ah yes convert back my bad!!! Ty. Cheers bro!!!"
So my drone fell out of the sky today. Where would be the proper location / channel to post the video and ask for in depth help?,Just did the same math on molicell p45b impressive that they can handle 202amps compared to the 80 of this other battery Thank you.  https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1267898219615092847
"just want someone to double check this for me, look good?",Yea it looks right to me ehm I will def download this. will be good for my 6s li ion
I think that'd be fine?. I don't know if you'll actually gain much from it,"just saw it on facebook market place at £20 each. Internal resistance and all that other stuff looks good. Thought it was a steal. but if its really not going to be that much of a difference then wont spend the money li ion packs are just better for lr ye, I got my own ones 6s1p using P45B molicells. They do great, seen this so cheap and the batteries look good. Thought it might be worth having a 6s2p in the arsenal."
that would be HUGE no?,"After a crash, one of my motors started randomly turning off. I replaced the motor, but that didn’t solve it, so I also replaced the ESC and flight controller. Now, my O3 unit is only providing 7 Mbps, and the drone randomly loses power. ye its literally double the weight of my currenty 6s1p :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
so is there any reason that li-ions are better for a radio battery?,"like multiple days in a row That's a good way to kill them. Use the same rules as lipos and don't do that I know its that way for lipos, but I was told liions last longer Li-ions *can be* more power dense, and they certainly cannot be *drained* at the same rate as lipos, but that doesn't make them more resistant to damage from improper care"
They're more power dense and don't need to be drained quickly?,"so does that just mean more capacity In relation to volume, yes Li-ions are also generally less prone to failure"
Anyone know if the walksnail avatar pro is compatible with a pavo20?,"its a li ion. I assumed its fine it's not as terrible as with lipos I’m trying to figure out if it needs a separate battery, or if it can be connected to the 3S 550 the Pavo20 uses  https://www.getfpv.com/walksnail-avatar-hd-pro-kit-32gb-w-gyro.html I mean, sitting fully charged isn't fine for *any* battery, li-ions just aren't nearly as likely to destroy themselves when left fully charged, They still degrade though"
the pavo20 fits an O3. it would prob fit an avatar. of course they degrade. but is it at a level where I should discharge the radio. wait never mind. I think it does not?. cuz betafpv do not include it in the pavo20 list. but they do include it in the pavo pico,"Let me put it this way. I *never* leave my radio fully charged or discharged. I *just* replaced the battery in it after 7 years. So, how long do you want the battery to live is the real question ehm. I have it at 8v now (its a 2s) Phone manufacturers have decided that a good charge level is 80%. Make of that what you will. but then again. 7 years is a long ass time Keeping a lithium battery between 20% and 80% is *far far* better for it than always going 0% to 100% il try and keep it between like 4v-7v in the future The issue is kindof exponential, so 4.0V/cell is already a pretty big difference compared to 4.2V/cell If it's 2S, I would stay between 6.4V and 8V.. Technically the range on a single li-ion is like 2.8V-4.2V, so 3.2-4.0 is a good range 4V would be 2.0V/cell aka dead-dead"
ok then. but isn't 8V pretty much full?,"It’s okay if it won’t fit properly because it’s just a temp unit It's not linear and the range does not go down to 0V I’m looking to see if I need a new battery for it, or if I can just hook it up to the main source"
well idk why betafpv didn't include it. ehm right right. 0 is 2.4v ish right?,yep got that part no problem. ooh its 2.8 ^ Right. GG's just reiterating from experience :face_with_tears_of_joy:
when flying a li ion pack. should I land at like 3v per cell?,"You don't clarify one time, thinking that it should be clear from the context, and then you get a photo of a radio that's actively on fire this was mostly a joke but I've gotten pics of aftermaths of radios catching on fire That's fair. I'm a nice guy, but not ""buy someone a new radio"" nice lol listen depending on the radio I could be. some radios are dirt cheap if someone had a spektrum and I caused it to catch on fire I would not buy them a spektrum *even I have standards* I typically come in before 3.0V/cell, but I've come in below that too and been completely fine"
spektrum are expensive as fuck?,"It kinda depends on the specific cells.  Read the spec sheet, it should tell you the voltage range.  Generally, you want to land at 20% above min. Spektrum radios are expensive and the protocol sucks ass You both misspelled overpriced Dammit I was implying again I mean, that one is just having a laugh. look at it. it's laughing in your face they are some molicells need to check what specific kind There is one very important thing you need to be conscious of Voltage sag. Li-ion packs generally have a lower C rating and thus they sag to shit I noticed li ion have a LOT more sag. when I used the boxer I had a 2s lipo. almost no sag. now with the T20 and li ion. a lot of sag"
"Just wondering, but do you know if they have a justification for such a high price tag ? When even the top of the line-iest tx16s mkii is only like 500 bucks","The justification is the brand name https://tenor.com/view/doctor-who-gif-9148453 No the brand name decreases the price here A radio should not pull nearly enough current to cause Li-ions to sag, unless they are really crappy cells not if you're the target audience @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) it was during charging issue is, if you go below minimum voltage due to voltage sag, even if the cells still have like 50% left in them, you're still kinda hurting them @Pika"
Voltage sag during charging? What?,"It doesn't just depend, it *Depends:trade_mark:* because that's what their customers wear -# Legal disclosure: this is a joke but they are not molicells I guess, I did see a few car people treat spektrum and Toshiba like the average person treats apple so they are kinda crappy I think they mean the effect that cells appear to have a higher voltage than they end up resting at during charging. it's got the same source as voltage sag - internal resistance (and slow charge redistribution) yep that. like I end charging at 8.2 but then when I unplug and shit it drops to like 7.9 or some number like that HMM. check your cell voltage balance. like, pull the cells out and measure each one individually. with a multimeter or whatever well for that I need a multimeter :). should really get one I SWEAR TO GOD. how are yall flying without a f*ing multimeter It took me a while to read thoroughly enough lmfao I am gonna get one in the next few days since I want to build a li ion pack how is that in any way relevant to having a multimeter :smiling_face_with_tear:. btw use the charger to measure tha batts. pls wait I think my 2s plastic thing. has balance. il check The chargers inside of radios aren't excellent at balancing cells. *some are so bad at it, they would probably be better of sans balancing* ok phew. seen a guy have 4.<a lot> and 3.<not a lot>. *it looked like it was 2 charge cycles from turning li-pos into lit-pops* you did make me take the thing out. and plugging it back in is sooooooo annoying. like fr the most akward place *sorry I was worried for your safety*. *won't make that mistake again :kekw:*"
"Hi, so before i start replacing my ph2.0 connector for an xt30, what exactly is the black cylinder in the middle, thats soldered onto the connectors, do i need it and do i have to pay attention to anything extra when replacing it, or can i just snip all of whats on the cable off?",its called a capacitor. its very much needed
but what if i wanna replace the ph2.0 for xt30. do i still need it?,yep. everyone needs it. unless its really low power
where would i put it on the xt30 connector?,the best place is on the actual + and - pads. of the FC that is the second best place. should really stick with the first one. on the pads of the board in your drone theres not really any space for it there so second best it is. tho the shorter the wire the better. @The GGManiack finished putting it back in just now :Harold:
"alright, so i just take the capacitor i have rn and solder it right onto the xt30 connector?. and then the wires onto the capacitor?","or solder extra wire to the pads and then solder the ends of them to the capacitor if you can use a shorter cable. I THINK. its better then at the XT30 @shmingus power wires get soldered directly to the XT30 capacitor gets soldered on as an extra ive watched some tutorials abt the xt30 upgrade and some didnt have a capacitor... ohh alright if it had a capacitor, it probably had a good reason to have a capacitor that reason is not related to the connector"
how do I know if a drone is capable of using li ion packs?,"any drone is, technically speaking of course. but I do not plan to make my motors blow up. or whatever other shit can happen with misuse It's not the motors that are likely to blow up. *unless you take a lipo so heavy that it only flies at 100% throttle*"
so it would look sth like this right?,"yeah pretty much @shmingus black box is the capacitor yes but make sure you insulate both of the cap legs. since if they touch. its a big no no shrink wrap, tape. you can also use bluetac or someshit like that Also, make sure you don't screw up the polarity, the side with the white strip is connected to the -/ground, or else it goes kababoom (from experience) i have a smoke stopper, but ill definitely pay attention to that you need the power wires to have a proper solder joint in the XT30 pins, because they carry a lot of power the capacitor can get soldered on top afterwards  the capacitor has a + and a - side. - side is usually labelled on the side of it.  Solder it + to +, - to - .   Pro tip: buy both sides of the XT30 (male and female) Solder the XT30 while it is plugged together (not into a battery for obvious reasons) If you solder it unplugged, the plastic will soften, the pins will move and misalign.   @shmingus A smoke stopper isn't a silver bullet, it can't always save you, so make sure everything is perfect even if you have a vifly smoke stopper"
"Is the melting also an issue on the yellow amass ones ? Or is this just for the black plastic copies, cause I still didn't have this issue on the official amass ones","I managed to do it on amass xt60's lol. black electrical tape would be fairly typical i have heatshrinks but only for the wire.. Well you are better (or worse) than me then, cause I only had this issue with the black shitty ones (or on some a30, I had a pin fall out on an a30) if you didn't buy an obnoxiously wide range of heatshrink sizes, then tape should work okay @shmingus yeah alright, ill order some TBS electrical tape idk their products seem good. like quality wise if you're ordering shit, order a heatshrink kit :face_with_tears_of_joy: I thought you had some electrical tape nah :loudly_crying_face: how do yall exist without electrical tape Only their vtxs are particularly good today this is my very first drone unrelated to drones. lmao. it's just ""default home maintenance equipment"""
"for who? electricians maybe, lol","I use painter's tape instead usually. Or just duct tape if you own a couple screwdrivers to do shit around your home, you should own some electrical tape.."
cut off... why not desolder? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,"considering the image you sent i mean.. i guess i could, but there would be too much wire i think it will be wise to desolder put the heatshrink on the legs of the capacitor BEFORE soldering it looks like the legs of the cap are already super short so this is what ir looks like rn wow that solder job is kinda tragic thats emax right there yeah sounds about on brand. but yeah anyway, I'd desolder"
"alright, so i just heat it up and it should come off?","yeah. if it doesn't, add some of your own solder. in case the stuff they used is super high melt"
does this look useful? https://www.getfpv.com/wafl-s-xt30-cap-cap-set-of-4.html,ngl seems like a waste of money sure. but its kinda useless
like will it make the job easier? most likely. is the job hard? not really,"yeah fair enough. alright, wish me luck then, idk when ill do it yet, gotta wait for everything to arrive. thanks for the help no problem. remember to make your work pretty and good looking. cuz when it does break. or you need help. we will see it Hey guys I just crashed my drone into dirt, and now my radio won’t bind with my quad The elrs blue light is just not showing any light, and I’ve tried to rebind it, but nothing is working.  Please help il be of help to the actual smart people"
can you send a picture of your elrs receiver?,You left this part out in the ELRS Discord
"*well, crashing the drone is obviously not related to ELRS not working, so why post that in the ELRS discord? /s*","*And the fact that the receiver isn't even powering on couldn't possibly be relevant, no reason to mention it*"
"You probably killed your 5v regulator. Do you have a multimeter?. See if you can measure 5v between a 5v pad on the FC and ground when you have a battery plugged in. If not, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k22Q0sKHd8s. If it does, you probably fried your receiver as I pointed out already","unplug the receiver to test too. if the receiver is toasted, it could be shorting out the FC i havent even seen anyone do the xt30 mod on the TH3 freestyle, its only the TH2's :/ if anyone has done that or has found a video it would be helpful to know how it went, lol Yeah, looks like this is burnt Yes, that ~~is~~ was the voltage regulator. Show a clear photo of both sides. Well now we know what RX it was. I was just trying to see if it shorted against the spark arrestor under it. That looks fine"
Do you know where I can find the same one?,Any FPV store that carries iFlight Okay thanks for all your help!! you should unplug the receiver and check if the drone powers up fully from the battery @CoasterJoint. ie. does all of the motor beeps (not just the first ones) No. It also did a wierd low pitch beep. https://tenor.com/view/there%27s-nothing-we-can-do-gif-14390726165144583214
quick question: is the battery charged (ish)?,"welp. sounds like the receiver was just a victim of a bigger overall issue. sometimes it do be like that. one small bump, everything ded. *been there, done that* yep. just the other day i smashed my drone in a wall, and out of all things, the balance lead on my lipo broke Check if the capacitor got loose or something OOF a friend of mine smashed his balance lead and the balance wires tangled up into the FC area everything ded :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Hey! I'm new here and I'm practically starting my adventure with FPV, as you know with time you want more. I currently own a Darvin Baby Ape v2 pro, Radiomaster pocket and google Eachine EV800. Generally I managed to connect everything and even as such it works, unfortunately I have a problem with the range of the VTX, despite the setting of full power I still sometimes have a problem at a distance of several tens of meters. Can I somehow improve this range? And I noticed that when landing as the drone descends it “vibrates” terribly. In general I would like to know what possible modifications I can make, I am not afraid of soldering iron :slightly_smiling_face: I send pictures of how the kit currently looks like, as far as I know everything is factory + added elrs receiver .

"what exactly does a capacitor do tho? like would the esc overheat or sth without it, or does it just make it safer?",A capacitor reduces voltage swings It makes the gyro not commit unaliving by making the voltage less noisy not even the primary reason for it Yeah but it's one of them
"ohh, so is it not like NECESSARY necessary?","It is necessary if you run more than like 2-3s it is very necessary on most builds, even 2S, if they are high power enough alright, good to know. ty! You CAN get away without it, if you have a low power 4S build running 6S capable parts. for example. but if you're utilising your hardware to within an inch of its life, you need it huh.. interesting that emax put a capacitor onto the 2s drone then. i guess it was necessary tho think of it this way. if it wasn't at least 80% necessary. they wouldn't have bothered. It's emax. If even they put a cap on it, you should be afraid."
"yeahh, fair enough, so i should definitely transfer it. idk if this belongs in shopping advice or not, but i heard of like the folded cell lipos, how much better exactly are those, is it worth the money?","Well, most of not all miniquad lipos are already folded cells Thank you, he always watching;) Folded/square cells is ""new"" for 1s tinywhoops @shmingus  To finish my explanation:  The most dangerous issue are voltage spikes Basically, take a spinning motor that's got a lot of current running through it, creating a large magnetic field, and stop it.  Like when you crash.  Suddenly, that whole magnetic field collapses and instead of current going out into the motor to make it spin, you have a motor creating current and pushing it into the drone.   That current will eventually go back into the battery, charging it up a tiny bit... BUT... the battery has internal resistance :slightly_smiling_face: So just like the voltage sags under load, it will spike under a large charging current.   So your main power which was on 7.4V might suddenly become 10, 11, 12V, or even more, for a brief instant.. Brief can be long enough to pop electronics. ohh that makes a lot of sense, thanks for clarifying A capacitor acts like a small, but very low resistance battery.. It will take the charge and thus reduce how much the voltage increases. And folded cell batteries (such as the betafpv lava batteries for exemple) are much much superior to the older style of rolled cells like the older gnb 300mah for exemple, folded cells will have much less voltage sag, and you absolutely should use folded cells batteries on your whoops gotta be a damn electrical genius to fly drones i guess, lmao That's why you got us who learned all of this shit the hard way lol. and I'm actually a software dev.. yeah, man i really appreciate it, i wouldnt even know where to start without asking you guys, lol. oh, nice me too :) yes, that is the only option. its the ECO, idk why i forgot that part out @CoasterJoint seems like the capacitor is soldered on the underneath of the ESC. might look like this: The main problem here is that the babyape vtx is just really really bad (like everything inside the baby apr), and the receiver inside the ev800 is very bad too, so you can put better antennas on, but it won't change that both ends are crappy, and a couple dozen meters is pretty normal if you have some interference in the way, like trees, and if you really want better range, you would need better goggles, or a better vtx alongside a better antenna on the ev800"
"@Sierran Did you verify that your goggles are on the exact same Band & Channel as your drone's VTX?. You can be a little bit off, still get video, but the range will be abysmal.. The stock EV800 antenna is garbage, unfortunately.","Flip the quad upside down, you should see it from underneath okay i see it now. its there"
"Thank you for your help:) probably I will switch to walksnail googles, they support analog video afaik. For now I must live with what I have. Any recommendations for the antena?. Checked, same :slightly_smiling_face: And yeah, antena is garbage","The goggles X support analog video *if you buy an av board and an analog receiver*. For the antenna, you could get a truerc singularity sma rhcp (assuming you run rhcp on the quad as well) Ouch, I was thinking that it’s embedded:("
how is knowing its there gonna help?,"Nope. The goggles x only support walksnail without any upgrades Dunno if it’s rhcp, but I believe it is :slightly_smiling_face:"
"It will let you know if you have to put a new one on or not. Is there maybe a little r/l on the antenna, or some clock / counterclockwise arrows on it ?","Ok I can see on photo,rhcp :slightly_smiling_face: Ok, well then you could/should get the truerc singularity rhcp rp-sma I'm trying to figure out what caused the catastrophic failure Damaged cap is a fairly common reason"
"I will look for that, any recommendations from our china friends? Because some of “brands” will not be available for sale in my country","Also, as I went to check, there seems to be a few different version of the ev800, since some shops list it with sma or rp-sma, can you check the connector on the goggles Refer to this message https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159450783931191336/1159450783931191336 I will check tomorrow, but sma for 80% This is the one you had: https://shop.iflight.com/iFlight-ELRS-Receiver-Pro1757. Make sure you get the 2.4 GHz version"
Btw. Foxxer antennas are recommended or will be better than stock on ev800?,"Well, anything will be better than the stock ev800 antenna, and the foxeer antennas like the foxeer lollipop are good, but the truerc singularity performs better One of my motors is randomly stopping /losing power even after replacing the esc and flight controller Is the e max a good starter fpv drone i got no clue what drone that is, man, i just googled, no results.."
do you mean the emax freestyle drones?,"Tinyhawk freestyle 3 plus Anywho, the tinyhawk freestyle line is kinda crappy. Don't get them oh yeah i have that one, its.. okay. i wouldnt get it again Fairs. I don't have a clue what fpv drones are good already built it flies not bad, but theres definitely better stuff for that price Can someone give me some good recommendations ive heard some good stuff about happymodel's mobula6/8's Would like it all ready to fly"
What's your budget and where do you want to fly at ?,"but theres definitely better people to ask for advice than me lol Yeah nope, not happening, all rft kits are a load of shit"
"BNF's are usually okay tho, right?","Some BNF are fine. Some are... less than optimal, others are a fire hazard Cause I'm not good at building stuff https://tenor.com/view/capybara-let-him-cook-gif-11999534059191155013 Well, you should start by picking up a radio and training in a simulator, you should look at either the Radiomaster boxer crush, the Radiomaster Pocket or the jumper t15, the jumper t15 and boxer crush are in about the same category, I personally would rather go with the boxer since the big screen of the t15 is useless for fpv imo, but both will work very well and have great ergonomics (even if they look big, they are very comfy), and the pocket if you want something small, tho the overhaul quality of the gimbals and of the radio of the pocket are quite a bit lower (and it has much less output power), you could also look at the jumper t20 gemeni, it's an in between size between the t15/boxer and the pocket, *get the ELRS version, not a question*, then get a simulator like liftoff on steam, or velocidrone, or trypfpv, I vastly prefer liftoff, it's the most realistic compared to miniquads, then pass a few dozen hours on the simulator, to be sure you like this hobby (I can't stress this enough, because fpv is an endless money hole) then come back and we will help you figure out which quad would be ideal for you. If you remove the mobula 6, 2024 and not 2024, then yeah. It's not that hard to build quads, it's just Legos but with software, and you will have to do it at some point in this hobby, there's not getting around it Fairs what are some good starter fpv drones though"
why do you recommend the crush instead of the normal boxer?,Cause you get the ag01 gimbals for 40 extra $. And the colors are cool
well 50. and are they that much of a difference?,"Yeah the ag01 gimbals are really nice ok then I know my next upgrade. getting ag01 in my T20. after getting the fan shit fixed. its annoying lol. ag01 are best described as the leather seat addon in a car Well, yes it's a luxury not a necessity, but that doesn't mean it's not a nice upgrade if you have 140$ to burn Do yk if there’s a cli bf command for proper motor direction. For props in what. first of all you want props out. second of all just use esc-configurator Yea props out my bad. How you open the site. you connect via the fc. then you plug in the battery. and press read settings. we've done this before And that makes sure the motor spin the correct way ,. 1 of my motors it stop moving automatically when I plug in the battery well once you press reversed on the motor you want. and save it"
hi this is random but what mount do you use? This looks like the geprc mk5 and I've been trying to find a good mount that works with an sma to ufl connector,only the ones spinning the wrong way I reverse them in BF and that way when going to the website it just reads it as such i'm old fashioned i dunno how to do it in bf esc settings like the old person I am well that. that doesn't reverse your motors. that just tells betaflight they are reversed
ehm did I do the esc before BF or after?. now you made me think :loudly_crying_face:,ima double check motor direction tmrw
"if my 6s 1300mah lipo has an IR of 10 on one cell and 3.6 on another cell, is that bad?. Or do I just need to worry about the highest IR cell rather than the IR difference between cells?",did you charge beforehand. before reading the readings I fixed it I had to mess with the settings. for the motors. it was weird tho. But it works now sad thing is I do have some motor throbble and I can’t get a preset cuz I’m in 4.3
how do I enable Dshot telemetry again?,esc tab. or motor tab
or should i just let it be disabled?,https://skystars-rc.com/product/skystars-h743-hd-dualgyro-flight-controller-h7-x8-with-osd-km60-60a-blheli32-4in1-esc/. this ive been told to set it to dshot300 because of this: well. that could make sense. but not to me. I don't see why you'd not use 600 okay. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) look what I have found then keep it on dshot300. makes sense although. I wonder. if there's a special case because you have two gyros true. I will do some research. maybe i will find something about it. or i might aswell ask in betaflight discord if they know anything about this case Thank you for clarifying! have a little question how exactly can I measure the input voltage of a BLDC where can I connect it
Whats the diffrent of 2blade vs 3/4 on a whoop?,"Higher thrust, a more punchy feeling, less flight time"
Whats the diffrent of 2blade vs 3/4 on a whoop?. With 2?,"Then the opposite of what i said And with more blades you get more grip on the air, but that only goes so far, if you add too much blades (or pitch) and the motors are too small, they will be under torqued for the prop and your quad will actually loose power and fly like shit with a ton of prop wash and bad responsiveness. And if all you are looking at is how much thrust you can push, a higher pitched bi blades can deliver as much thrust as a lower pitch triblade. And assuming you have the stock smart16 motors, which are 0803, you could try the gemfan 1608-3 (or the hq 40mmx3) (but it might throw off the tune)"
Is it normal that 1s batteries dies fast? I buy them 3 days ago tattu 300mah 1s and now they are dead not charging,"nope. what did you do to them I dont know i just flew one time until it got to 3v which connector do they have, cause with ph2 it can happen that you tug on the cable when trying to umplug it yeah, that's way too low land when you're hovering at 3.5v"
yup. what charger do you have?,yeah that is also known to kill batteries
Im wondering about buing vilfywhoopstar 3 is it good?,"the best. make sure you also only buy tattu, betafpv LAVA and dogcom 1s batteries"
"hey, so when i fly my quad, it shows way too low voltage in the osd, like 3.2/cell right after taking off with newly charged batteries, either the batteries are shit or the current sensor is configured worng, i have a TH3 freestyle but the voltage config in BF looks correct right?  and when i plug in a battery it reads the right voltage, like in the screenshot (i only have 1 battery rn but it uses 1s 650mAh 3.8V batteries. can anyone help me configure it?",do you think 3.7v is full
"and not a battery from Tattu, BetaFPV LAVA or DOGCOM?. (and the others)",noo.. havent arrived yet well... that's how it is. voltage sag. make sure you're charging to 4.2v
which of these would you recommend the most?,they are all the same. all made by greprow (tattu). https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250
"so are my batteries actually at like 6.8V while flying then, cause that would ruin them.. right?","yes that would kill them but. they aren't. like this is still not great for them, but they're just *sagging* down to that voltage. do me a favor and fly a pack, then land and stare at the battery voltage a bit. you'll understand then, how it recovers and such alright so the voltage makes sense now, but i still cant figure out why the amperage says like 2000 mah used when i disarm. :PepeShrug: eh probably because that isn't calculated. it's a useless metric for anything that isn't long range anyways"
"i meann yeah fair enough, but if its calibrated, i could see how much juice i have left on the osd right?","not really. that much voltage sag you might as well forget it. just use the voltage, and remember how long you can fly"
hey guys. I cant figure out what ground assistance type is for?. Should i use auto?,keep it on auto. and refer to betaflight docs. also use galileo
"Okay ty. I am setting up RTH for my 7"". Should work fine right? Mostly for Mountain Dives",I'd probably let someone else look at that. I need to be sleeping lol
What does the midle voltage mean?,"im pretty sure thats the input voltage from your cable Hey guys I'm looking to get back into fpv drones and  was wondering, could any of the more experienced help me, I already have a controler "" Radio Master Pocket ELRS"" but I dont have the drone or the glasses, I found this website in Lithuania that builds drones by the order and I was wondering if I could send a link to the website for you guys to check it out and pick the parts that would be very helpfull, If you any of you are up to the task reply to this message and I will give more info on what kind of drone I want. It's the input voltage from the psu https://fpvmarket.eu/ /\ click the link above Yeah don't use a third party to build your quad, you will pay a few hundreds more than the cost of the parts, just build it yourself No, putting the cap on the battery connector completely negates any benefit. The cap must be directly on the ESC pads or as close as possible to the source of the noise"
Goggles integra vs goggles v2?,i read that putting it directly on the esc is best but it will still protect it a bit/ is the 2nd best position if its on the connector also theres basically no space inside the TH3 FS for the cap
oh damn.. i mean a cap on the xt30 is still a bit better than no cap.. right?,"It's just dead weight im not sure, but theres already one on it out of the factory, so i would assume that taking it off  wouldnt be very beneficial"
Necessary? No Helpful? Yes I would just size the cap to the build,"huh..alright, the only thing im kinda scared of is ruining sth if i dont use a cap, i read on a reddit thread that a few people have fried their esc without a cap on the TH2 FS You can use a much smaller cap on a 2S 2"" than on a 6S 5* Emax improved the electronics on the TH3 AFAIK. The TH2 had... Issues alright.. i think ill use one just to be safe.. makes me feel safer, lol But yea if you get like a 10 or 12V cap around 200uF that should be small enough  to stick somewhere... I would think i was thinking of getting this pigtail, its pretty light: https://betafpv.com/products/4s-whoop-cable-pigtail-xt30 Again, that does nothing If you can't put the cap directly on the ESC pads, use a short extension of heavier gauge wire it came with a cap on the power board. the 2x1S adapter so I'm inclined to keeping it that way.... ofc, putting the cap directly on the power pads is much better. *but I fear that emax had a reason for putting it at least on the power wires*"
That reason? ||Incompetence||. Or just because they saw other people doing it,"One of the best purchases ive made not to long ago. Flywoo also have them for sale if you cannot find WoFL's specific ones. There is essentially no room inside the Tinyhawk frame once you put in the aio, they left no real estate for anything else at all. I had a bitch of a time just getting an ELRS receiver into mine when I did my 3S conversion. Now, you could still argue that that counts as incompetence :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
"if i wanna solder the battery connector onto the esc, i would do it like this right?  and do i just have to make sure that theres the cable and solder touch the top of the pad there?","Yes, and you just have to make sure the wires are only connected to the pads and not shorting to anything else otherwise you will be very sad, and that the soldering is good (so solder on the whole pad, nice and shiny and round etc, you can post a photo of the aftermath if you want)"
"alright, will do, thankss. btw, do i need a desoldering pump to desolder something? or can i just heat it up and remove it some other way?","Either a solder sucker or solder wick to actually remove the solder itself. If all you need to do is remove a component, just heat up the joint and pull yeah, well i need to remove the old battery connector from the esc IME I do need to normally remove at least some solder to remove a component though, especially through-hole soldered stuff"
so i just heat it up and move it off?,Yea for a pad-soldered joint you should be able to just heat up the joint with your iron and pull it off
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet). Could you please help out? and how exactly would i set that up on the crux3 1s?,Probably more range than you'll get out of the battery on a 1S drone
What do you want to use it for ?,"Assuming 4s, look at the aerolite 1605 3800kv. Or the 3500kv version the whole point is for it not to be expensive. beleive me if i had the money id get the aerolite 1605 or the tmotor 1604 https://ummagawd.com/collections/motors/products/ummagawd-aerolite-1605-3800kv-motor-gunmetal-purple-3mm-shaft It's the same price as the lava one and they have the weird mounting It's not that big of a deal or non us. i thought you were euro right I just used us websites that showed the price in $. And it's a 16$ difference once you bought 4 of them oh well for me its this. yeah. besides idk if i can even use either. im pretty sure i need it to be 9x9 its the darwin baby ape 2 its 9x9. and i dont have enough to get a new frame too Well you are screwed cause it's 8.5x8.5 nah it fits 9x9. people have put the tmotor pacer 1604 in it stock no modification. and thats a 9x9. worst case ill drill it out a little Well, might be the baby ape one then yep, the 3in 3s has weird mountimng. the 3.5in 4s that i have has 9x9 Anywho, the lava motor is way too high of a kv and is kinda not great motor limiting exists Yeah but it screws the torque a bit 4000 is fine. so i wouldnt be motor limiting much 4200kv on 4s is really high for a 3.5"" yeah it is. but if i motor limit to 4000 which would be like 0.955 not really. brotherhobby vy1504.5 is 3950. 3800 to 4000 is the sweet spot. but then again thats like running 2100kv on 5inch, its not for everyone and some people like less Imo 3800kv is the right kv for most people yeah 3800 is kinda peak for freestyle. you can go a little higher or a little lower. 3500 is imo peak for balanced efficiency and power Eh, 3500kv is about like 1750kv on a 5"", some people like that yeah. 1750 on 5 inch is great But anywho, it's only 16$ more for some actually good motors, so I would say just get the aerolites fair enough. but they arent 9x9. im considering these fpvcycle 16mm motors rn. where is fpvcycle located at yeah im tryna figure out the state. kabab lives in cali im pretty sure. so it should be based in cali] It's a 12x12, iirc you can fit 12x12 diagonally with 9x9"
waitttttt. really?. waitttttttt,"that would be nice. aight im prolly just gonna get 40$ whoop motors and fix my whoop. and just fly that 9x√2=~12.79, so probably not until i sell my gopro. and my insta360 Otherwise, you can just get the 16x16 t motor pacers ones yep. those are the ones i was thinking of. but they are like the price of the ummagawds but they fly crispy. they are the only one of these motors ive actually flown on a friends quad. they flew reallllly good. i think ima just get whoop motors to have sum to fly. and then buy the pacers later on when i can actually afford them lmao I mean, if you didn't compare them to other motors on the same quad, it's hard to say that it's thanks to the motors that it flew well, but whatever yeah i mean they flew good on that quad so i can see your point. same prop size though. and close enough auw. my auw is like 250g now but my target is 280-290. and his auw is like 310. i like an auw closer to 300 much more than 250g. on 3.5"
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) got any tips for tuning out jello? i got the quad to fly good enough for me with a small tweak to the anti gravity gain but i think it made the jello a tiny bit worse,"just using ians guide i was gonna increase the tpa but i think thats just for throbbles. damn I have no idea how to tune a quad aye same. when j63 got his quad back from you i thought you tuned it lol. imma try messing with the p &i slider it do get 8 mins of flight Nah, I only flew analog at this point so I wasn't even able to fly them, I could only do a los testing betaflight needs to add an auto tune feature. so i dont have to learn this stuff. so many of us can build quads but cant tune lol Betaflight used to have auto-tune and it really sucked. It actually was a feature that was included when Betaflight branched from Cleanflight, and was quickly removed, iirc. Because it sucked"
"Oba lietuvs, nieka į gym katik atejo, o to ?","You leave it on and use it. It's to secure the ufl, just slide it out, put on the ufl, and slide it back. And it will hold much better and doesn't really impact the vtx with a screw on retention bar if its slid out, it wont fit on the ufl connector It will, you just need to slide it outwards first"
"hey quick question about my esc, those dont look like pads that the battery connector is soldered onto right, do i have to stick the wire through?","using the walksnail vtx it doesnt really leave any room. correct they go through, not a pad"
does that change anything abt the soldering /desoldering?,"not really, just make sure its all the way in, and make sure the solder flows for atleast a second or 2. i soldered similar plugs for my whoop and it was fine. desolder, heat it up, tug it down  and it should come right out"
are you soldering like new leads onto this same board?,"yeah im soldering an xt30 pigtail onto it. thats a TH3 freestyle since you're using the same board, you will need to wick or pump the solder out IF the new leads dont slide in ALL the way through. they need to poke just a lil teeny bit out the top. if it gets stuck on sodler in the hole, and you cant go all the way through to make it proper, then you do want a pump or wick"
can i do that with like a paper towel or some shit?,paper towel = fire. heat my dude legit it would be a million times easier to just buy a cheapo solder pump yeah but that takes time and money to order :/. or buy somewhere
"dont ship, just go to a like lowes, harbor fright, home dpot, etc. its worth it to make sure its done correct, right?",so no diy version for removing solder then... yeahh fair
"the only other thing that TAKES away solder, is solder wick, or solder pump, or MAYBE like some spare non tinned wire? but then it would probably just solder that wire into the hole. you could try not tinning the new wire you're going to solder in, heat and push the wire through with flux. and that should? absorb the solder into ur new wire. thts uh ur perogative tho lol thts not a guarantee it would work","tbh at that point it just sounds easier to go to a store and look for a pump or sth. ill do that then. thanks, i hope i will manage to solder it well google for a store that has a regular solder pump in stock near u and u should be good i think. Connector is slid out, and it does not have enough room for me to click the ufl in and slide the connector to lock Oh, ok, well, I personally just pry it off when I can't use it, probably not good practice tho"
how do i pry it without hurting the actual ufl?,can someone help to try to fix my gps https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1268266520828711023 I just bend it away usually

What causing a drone not to yaw to the right? it can yaw to left. drone is dji m600 pro,"that honestly could be anything from the flight controller, to the radio True, one of the antennas are broken but not sure if that is related open betaflight, try it in the receiver tab and see if the drone is responding how you want oh right. then whatever software you have you basically just have to contact dji. or hope someone knows"
damn dji is a pain in the ass. can you not configure that at all?,"There is a configurator for it, I'll check the channel mapping, the controller is brand new."
"Morning, quick question. Is there any point in buying a walksnail kit for a baby ape v2 pro? Do you make an approach to another drone?",Partially depends on exactly which Walksnail VTX you want to use. The BabyApe does not have a lot of real estate with that 45-degree mounted AIO FC
"Hey, how can i know/calculate at how many Amps i should charge my lipo?. e.g. if i have a 650mAh 2s battery, or a 650mAh 1s battery. do i just do 650mAh/1000 = 0.65Ampere?. is that just 1C for it then?",Yup. It will be 650mA
can i also charge at 2C or is that bad for it?. cause i would guess that it would lose some capacity or sth,"Depends on battery, but most of manufacturers recommends or tells you to stay on 1c, unfortunately I have only dealt with smaller cells, I don't know how it is with larger ones. alright, atm i only have 1s and 2s batteries anyway :). thank you! No problem! I'm just learning myself, so I could be wrong what the maximum charging current is, but for those batteries what I have the manufacturer prohibits charging more than 1C. Most lipos can handle 2c, the manufacturer or the store you bought them from will say their max charge rate.. Some can even charge at 5c i mean the shitty lipos i have rn barely charge at all so i think ill stick to 1C, lol That's correct, so we need to know what vtx you wanted to use You're right, now that I look at it, there's unlikely to be any way to easily mount something digital, you'll run out of space. So that leaves me to possibly build or buy something else, and the baby ape will be left to experiment :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Quick question, what does the ""Motor direction is reversed"" option in betaflight actually do? I've noticed it doesn't actually change the motor directions I had to do that in esc-configurator","All it does is actually tell the flight controller what direction the motors are spinning, hence the language used So, the ESC doesn't actually *know* which way the motor is spinning; there's no way for it to specifically know if a motor is spinning CW or CCW. As such, there is also no way for it to tell the FC which way a motor is spinning. That's why you have to set them manually. But the FC actually does need to know which direction they are spinning, so that it can control them properly. So that's what that checkbox does"
"Hi, can i not just use a simple Phone charger for the whoopstor 3, for me its showing 8.8V? is that low or is that fine for charging batteries?. what im using:. nvmd i found a different one that can deliver 12.1Volts, i think that should be enough. also how tf do i unplug my ph2.0 1s lipos without tugging on the cable.. i feel like itll break them","Yes, the directions that the FC needs to send to the ESC are different when the motors are spinning one way vs the other ~~by upgrading to bt2.0 or a30~~ sorry for the many questions but no, you just kind of have to... do it i know, but i got them now..sooo. alright.. lol. doesnt feel right tho tugging on the wires isn't like the worst thing if you're not reckless. I usually put my nails under the two sides. that works. but you need nails for that yeah mine arent really that long. i have nose pliers, maybe i can use those somehow don't poke them on the metal bits. lol"
the pliers are isolated.. but it would short sth right?. do i charge these bad boys to 4.35 since it says HV or 3.85?,"gosh I almost thought you were asking if they were good and lost all hope. 5 fucking dollars lol no, i know theyre trash. its just what came with the drone. IK :loudly_crying_face: so HV LiPo's are basically just LiPo's that are rated to be charged up to 4.35. you gain a few seconds of flight time doing that, but it also degrades the cells quicker. but given these 1s cells are disposable anyways most people just do that anyways well im only gonna be using these until next Thursday, when i finally have all my stuff to solder on the XT30. so 4.35V it is xt30/. ohh you got the goofy ass 2s one Tinyhawk 3 conversion yeah i need all the pity with this POS. lol. yuhh my first quad was a tinyhawk 2. with a frsky qx7 access oh, cool. honestly in my very nooby opinion the TH3 freestyle doesnt suck that bad. the batteries and ph2.0 are ass but i think after the xt30 upgrade itll fly alright. i also have the ELRS, Hdezro version tho, so idk what the analog experience is like shit. and really these cheapo component quads. they just fly far worse than anything else. like yes, it is still fun and it doesn't feel like it sucks right now. but in due time it will i think by then i will have upgraded, im already saving for a 3'' toothpick (that i will build myself) you see. you're not supposed to upgrade. you're supposed to build an army yeahh.. i mean, ill probably still use the TH after getting more drones, but im sure im gonna fly way better ones. the vifly whoopstor 3 is actually amazing tho"
Can I use a 6S LiHV on a board that is for a 6S LiPo?,"Yes, almost all escs have some headroom even at a 6s LiHV"
"Guys quick question, I got a HGLRC specter f760 stack, can I use 6s batteries on it? Or is there something I have to do first","what exactly does kv mean if the speed of the motor depends on the pulse width then what does voltage have to do with it Kv is a rating, telling you how many RPM the motor will turn at (without a load) *per volt applied*. So, if you have a 1000kv motor and you apply 10V, it will try to spin at 10V x 1000kv = 10000 RPM. The full voltage is applied to the motor by the ESC FETs when they are open, but you control the *average* applied voltage using the duty cycle of the signal. So if the throttle signal applied is a 50% command, the ESC will only open the FETs for 50% of the time, so the ""effective voltage"" being applied to the motor is 5V (in this example) so 50% of the time would mean only 50% of the voltage is going through. ahh that makes some sense Sort of. Technically the entire battery voltage is applied when the FET is open. It's just that the FET is only open for 50% of the time. It's the same way that an LED dimmer works. By very quickly shutting it off and turning it back on, you can make the LED look dimmer yeah. is the amplitude of the signal generated by the FET always at the battery voltage then Yea the top of the square wave is always full battery voltage neat. btw so if I connect an oscilloscope to the motor and turn it on should it show the pulse generated"
What settings should i look at to see if its optimal for video with googles? Geprc smart 16 ‐> fatshark goggles only got about 20-30m range before antwars,"As long as the scope is rated for however much voltage, yea I seen someone connect a resistor to the ground wire to make a virtual neutral point. not sure what a virtual neutral point is but am I supposed to do that Yea that makes sense. In addition to driving a magnetic bell by switching the phase coils, the phase coils that are turned *off* get a current *induced* by the motion of the turning bell (thanks Faraday). That's called ""Back EMF"". So it makes sense that you would need another neutral point for the scope, otherwise you'd get weird readings as they bounce up and down (plus you need a ground to sink all of that power to through the scope). Disclaimer though: I am just a software guy with some lab experience, I am not a lab or electrical tech eh it makes some sense ig. thanks a lot ahahaha"
"i just got my first controller (radiomaster pocket) to practice in some sims, and i'm just wondering if the default tension is okay to keep using? i'm used to an xbox controller and that was very uniform but this feels much different and i don't know if i should lower the tensions or just get used to the default it came with","You can adjust them to however is comfortable for you, there isn't any single recommendation anyone can make here because it's all based on personal preference"
Do i set up vtx str in beta? Ill check what i can :slightly_smiling_face:,"It's a screenshot from JBs video about the nazgul eco oh ok. rats, I wish I could find a mount like that"
ight thx. any ND filter recommendations maybe? Im thinking about original dji ones but not sure yet,"I recently got the avata 2 and idk if somethings up with the camera or im using it wrong or smth. When im shooting lets say 4-5pm which is still very sunny here I use 4k60,100iso, and I have to put the shutter all the way up to like 500-1000 so my footage is not completely bright, I dont have nd filters. What should I do or should I just keep to high shutter speed how do i stop my solders from spiking :PepeDent: theres probably better people than me to answer, but for now i can say: make sure to heat up both the metal and the pad youre soldering on and hold the metal close, from what ive seen (never soldered before but seen plenty of tutorials lol) and maybe use flux if you dont have flux on your solder already. but idk. if im wrong, which i totally could be, please correct me More flux, clean tip. Sounds like normal camera ops in sunlight. Get an ND filter or accept high shutter speed Get a solder sponge so you can clean the tip better I'm sure the DJI ones are fine"
"Guys for the hglrc specter f760, can I plug in a 6s battery straight away or do I need to solder some pads together or something like that?","I guess reading the manual or product description is hard :/ I have already read it. Also which way is straight because I have no idea Well read it again if you can't figure out what voltage it can take, cause it's written on it. It should be written on the pads - and +, round side of the xt60 goes to the - pad, pad + goes to the square side of the xt60 I did not understand what you wrote sorry. I mean which way is facing straight Doesn't matter, you can correct for it in betaflight"
Why is it a fire hazard?,"My lipo is a bit damaged and the resistance of one cel is lower than the other one, is it bad or I do I just don't charge it in parallel and it should be fine assuming you were using a good charger that should be fine, however, your charger is a fire hazard there's so many instances of the B6AC making fires, and never of any good chargers like the D6 Pro I got the v2 and I've never seen someone saying it has caught fire look, I'm not just trying to waste your money, its genuinely dangerous to use that charger. in this instance it looks like its their fault but the V2 has all the problems of the normal B6AC The issue with it is fairly simple in the end - it has no cooling.. And these chargers are extremely well known for being shit. Mine (not V2) tried to detonate a lipo (by overcharging a cell). The most basic requirement for a good charger is active cooling.. Knockoffs of b6's that include a fan fail astonishingly less often. What in my experience fails most often is the balancing circuitry. The same circuitry that measures the iR.. It will either end up overcharging a cell or shorting a cell to ground It doesn't happen when new, but over time it degrades. Like intel cpus lol But there is an internal thermometer. :face_with_tears_of_joy: As your batteries get older, they require more balancing, the balance circuitry goes though more heat cycles, and eventually it goes out of spec far enough to cause issues. Some units will error out, others will start overcharging or undercharging.. Eventually the circuitry will fail in a more spectacular manner. Ok thanks for the info I've seen these chargers last years - when people weren't charging lipos that need balancing. Mine lasted a year, but I charged a lot, with a parallel board, and often at max current. The failure has preceding symptoms. The charger will take longer and longer to finish charging@therealemile. The last part of charging will just take oddly long Is their a 3d printable Antenna mount for the SourceOne V5 ok perfect I'll check"
"damn thats weird, maybe try restarting BF?","make sure after setting the value to type ""save"" and then hit enter Ive done that but after reboot value didnt change"
"Antenna should not touch carbon fibre. It will interfere.. If you have to keep it where it is, you can just put some electrical tape over that secti9n of the arm (under you mesh wire) so the antenna doesn't have contact with carbon.. Also have you done a elrs bench test?. https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/pre-1stflight/. Also you need to make sure that the antennas on your radio and pointing the same way as the antenna on your drone. For example: if I have my antenna on my drone vertical and the one on my radio horizontal I will loose a shit tone of signal.. https://oscarliang.com/antenna-positioning/",Tried restarting no diffrence :unamused_face: @Sohail thanks a lot for the help. No wonder I was getting so bad signals haha. It was literally kissing the carbon fiber and was even mounted the worst way possible do the bench test should get like -20/-25 dbm It is. Thanks a lot. Before that I got line -40 on bench test amazing how such small thigns have such a big impact :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Nope. Are there good ones out there for the rp4t ?. And isnt it better to mount it away from the VTX receiver?,"You should just mount the antenna away from the vtx, the rx itself doesn't care too much about the rf, so a good spot to mount it would be behind the camera at the front of the quad or on an arm, even if with how good elrs is, the difference is negligible I wanna mount it either near the cameramount or on the front arms. I guess I will use zip ties. Solves the problem Yeah that's how most people hold the antenna. The Rx can just be help with double sided tape (after putting a heatshrink over it)"
Can I also leave it like this? @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks). Or also heat shrink onto it,"Nah that's a pretty normal way to mount jt. I meant to heat shrink the Rx, not the antenna"
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks). You mean like this right?,Probably. I would also use double sided tape or a ziptie to secure kt Its stuck in place in my case. It wont move much. If i crash my drone again i will redo it and put double sided tape on there and secure it a bit better
You can use less throttle?,"I don't really feel like I'm using too much ATM, it might just be from normal drones, more used to hovers Yes, but you shouldn't.. You need to learn to control the throttle. If you alter it's response, you'll have to relearn when it comes to changing it again."
What is a normal drone to you compared to this nazgul eco 6s?. If you mean dji with it's positional holds and sensors that nazgul will never be like that,"Takes a little while to get used to making the miniscule changes to the throttle that are required to maintain altitude during maneuvering. I've been wanting to buy the deadcat nazgul with the o3 since all the hype videos came out. But it would be my biggest quad and first 6s Just in general, don't matter tho lost connection and the drone is gone"
"i have this 3s lipo and toolkitrc balance charger, i wanna charge each cell to 3.8v but the minimum charge seems to be 4.15v. Using stoCHG also seems to result in a battery error. Any help please? Thanks","You have the balance lead plugged into the wrong side of the balance port on the charger. Move it all the way to the left. Right now the charger thinks you've plugged in an 8S battery that only has 3 working cells, so it's confused got it. stochg works now what about that minimum voltage thing tho It makes *some* sense that in normal Charge mode the charger wouldn't let you charge lower than 4.15V (not that I think that was a good choice on the part of the manufacturer). Try it in Storage Charge mode to get to 3.8V"
"I have a question about a battery. Lets say i have a 1000mah, 10c battery.  What does it mean? Does it mean that the most current it can give is 6 amp?. (Without damaging itself)","Well I found it, but now I get no video from the camera it seems to be plugged in, idk what else it could be you can help the camera does not transmit video to the camera. I checked everything is connected except the red wire. The red wire is power for the camera. 1Ah * 10c = 10A. 1300mAh @ 100C = 1.3Ah * 100C = 130A"
Ohh... that how it works?,"yes that is theoretically how it works, but here comes the annoying part:. LiPo companies have different ways of measuring the C-rating, two companies could have the exact same performance and amp output in reality but list different ratings Did you try just soldering back on the red wire, which is here to power the camera I thought 1000mah means that the battery has a capacity to provide 1amp in an hour, and if i choose to discharge it faster, like in 6 minutes, then the current would multiply 10 fold accordingly.... but i guess my logic was wrong. No it's right, but that's just two different metrics. The c rating is the maximum discharge rate It can provide 1 amp for an hour is what mah means mAh is about the capacity"
So what does 1ah×10c=10a means? That I can get a 10 amp current for 6 minutes safely?,me when i just explained how much more complicated this is. but aymeric instantly forgets. god damn dude You can discharge at 10 amps maximum I didn't bother to re explain everything since you already did just before
Ohh... ok... so this is the equation for max current: 1mah×10c. Right?,For an idea of it yes. It's not perfect but it gets you close I get you. It's an approximation.. Bullpark.. Rough numbers. Yea because companies don't like uniformity Sounds like we need a regulatory body to put all those companies in line Ideally the companies just be honest and not use manipulative marketing or tests
"Now i have another question if i may...  I have a motor and an esc. In motor specs it says max current 15a (it also adds <60s in brackets. Anyone has an idea what the ""s"" stands for?)  But my esc is 30a.   Do you think there might be a problem?","seconds. 15a for less than 60 seconds. and no, you can't have too many amps"
Why would it be for less than 60 seconds? The motor is supposed to work for longer than that.. Ohh... thats like the max.. Does the motor regulate the intake of amps?,Yeah but basically (a bit simplified but whatever) it's the maximum amps it can handle for a period of time without melting
Why there can't be too much amps?,well... by the way electricity works. a component will only use as many amps as it needs But it does say that it can be damaged if it gets 16a for more than 60 seconds... Your motor will only take what it needs
"I mean, i know the basics of electricity..... But how does it know?","Yeah but if an esc is say 60A, it doesn't mean the motor will get 60A continuous, it means that the esc can provide up to 60A continous You can forcefeed the motors, having an esc with a million amp will still work. It just allows the power to flow in the right pattern to the motor"
Ok.. how does the motor regulates the incoming current?,By its resistance and inductance and back emf
Or.... am i not getting here something?,"It doesn't, the fc just tells the esc how to spin the motor, the esc (bit simplified but whatever) regulates how much voltage is sent to the motor, the motor spins proportionally to the voltage being supplied to it and voila, the motor doesn't ""know"" anything, it just does what the esc tells it to do Yes A sink will have the same flow, no matter how big of a pipe you run to it. Unless the pipe is too small (too low amp esc) Ok. So the buttom line is not worry about it. Yup. If your ESC can do more amps than the motor it's not an issue Well, you still need an esc that can output enough amps, but you don't need to worry too much about how it works to know what to use If your ESC is less than the motor then your motor won't be full power"
"guys, wtf do i use to plug into my Vifly Toothstor, all the power supplies that plug into a power outlet dont work.. it always says needs more power, im using a short USB-A to USB-C Cable with a power supply that my Whoopstor 3 said around 12,5 Volts for.. soo how do i plug it in?","No, if the esc can't send enough amps it will simply burn So you say there is such a thing not enough amps but no such thing as too much amps The esc doesn't limit how much amps go through it I don’t think there’s any usb-a power supplies that support usb pd You need a 60 or higher watt usb-pd power supply. Power delivery USB power delivery, it's a special USB type that output more voltage"
yeah but like whats the name of what i need. lol. like 20V power supply?,Look for a usb power brick above 65 watts
Should i load this file onto the vtx in betaflight?,Or yeah just get a dc power supply and solder an xt60 to the end Or just use the barrel plug it comes with You want at least 2 amps 12v I think The toothstor also uses a dc barrel
would some cheap shit like that work?,"I would buy an Anker or UGreen brick with multiple ports you're going to want to power the soldering iron, the charger and much more off of it. and might as well charge your phone at the same time"
good point. then sth like this?,"yeah that's better. i got a chonky 200W brick i dont have money for that rn, lol pointing out something scummy. check if all those ports can actually do 65W. or only one of them Its anker, its likely legit no anker is often not legit anymore But probably only does 65w if only one port is being used ugreen is where it's at nowadays sadly Yeah it’s probably 65w total"
"Just above a few of your was talking about maximum amps. I asked the same question a few days ago just want to make sure I fully understand it, So i can understand the OSD information better.   For example I have a homemade 6s pack u sing molicell p45B. 4500 mAh and rated for 10c I believe. So my math would be 4.5ah * 10c = 45A.   However is that multiplied by 4 for the purpose of the OSD information on reading how many amps are being drawn (4 motors?) meaning my total amp draw cannot exceed 180?","The osd shows the total amp draw. So if there is written ""20A"", then there is 20A being pulled from the battery. So in this case it cannot exceed 45A why is the Usb-A one the only one without 65W :loudly_crying_face: (even if in fairness it should stay quite a bit lower since li-ions aren't very good at outputting a lot of amps, just like you wouldn't draw 100A continuously from your lipos, even if they are rated for it on paper (and that we ignore than the written c rating is kind of not that useful)) Because usb-a does not support usb-pd. It can’t go above 5v 2a"
lol really? then whats the point of vifly shipping a usb-a to usb-c cable with their Toothstor. that sucks,ok cool cheers brother :slightly_smiling_face: Actually maybe it can do the lower levels of pd. But not many power supplies do it Im... back with another question about batteries. Im trying to do so much research before I atempt this next flight. I been flying round in circles with my packs making sure they work and learning and getting used to reading the OSD infor for long range flights. Just scared to send it :p

"Like if a motor never takes more amps than it needs, why would there be a warning for max current?",whyy must they not work
they dont work?. oh ik why. the website automatically detects your region. so it changes the link for you,and that ones not existant and then it opens a fucking zoomer video. like teehee buy my products im a man look at me. being manly with my ugreen brick. in vertical form factor. just pick the one that can actually do 65W or more on one port oh theres actually a comparison here:. i think ill get the first one in the columns then. actually yes but check if they actually do 65W on a single port
the first one is just a smaller one of the last one. i think they can do 65W on any port. but idk if simultaniously. doesnt say that. soo turns out it does say that:. thats good enough right?,"just did, into video transmitter tab, loaded the json file and saved. now i tried to change vtx power still at 0 Reboot, make sure you have the VTX turned on, and send a screenshot of the VTX tab in Betaflight configurator"
Dumb question do i need batteries in the drone / and cable then?,well you'd want the top one
shouldnt i have something enabled here?. how do i know wich UART the Perhipherals that should be enabled? or should i?,This is right out of the manual for your stack
Something iam missing out on?,Yea you just need to set the Power drop down to whatever you want. 'None' is not ideal lol
"Does ""Band"" matter that much or?","Raceband Channel 4 is R4, so whatever band and channel you want to be on. https://learnassets.getfpv.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/24021107/Frequency-Reference-Chart-2020-12-23-011.png"
"I got power at 100, if i make it higher would it make any diffrence?. Can the drone support it? power loss?","The VTX is capable of outputting that power, that's why it's configured that way. You can run it at 200mW, that's fine, it doesn't hurt anything. It'll get you a bit more range"
Cuz now i had like 50meter tops 100 with some interferance. So i would rather make it to 200mW nothing can happen execpt more range?,"Well with the VTX unconfigured before there's a good chance the VTX was stuck in pit mode, essential 0 output power get vtx_power vtx_power = 3 Allowed range: 0 - 7 Default value: 0. still at vtx_power 3 according to cli. with it set at 200mW"
"How i know wich channel to set?. Now when iam starting the drone, i just click on the goggles until i see something","When in doubt, I just set everything to Raceband 8. Yea don't do that, it's a recipe for terrible range i usually have 2 channels i see in Just set everything to R8 and forget about having to change the channel. Normal behavior, see the chart I posted above"
What´s the point of the band / channels when i have fatshark goggles but i should set it to raceband?,Fatshark is just the name of the channel band. It's not an exclusivity thing
haha. if someone ealse is flying aswell and we´re on the same band and channel it would be few problems?,"Same band, no, same band and same channel, definitely problems. But also, different band, *same frequency*, problems. Again, see the chart above, you can see where each channel in each band overlaps the others"
"i assume at Fpv races etc, they set it as they bout to fly?","Yea everyone gets assigned a specific band and channel and everyone makes sure they have clearance before the heat starts oh oke, ill try the drone out now thanks for help mate :slightly_smiling_face: :thumbs_up: check back in if you still have issues i think you dont even have time to miss me :p,"
"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) if motor never takes more amps than it needs, why would there be a max current warning?",heat. and other factors
But... how can i regulate the current that going into the motor? Didnt you say there is no such thing as too much amps?,But thats the thing... the specs say that the esc generates 30a current. But the motor has a 15amp limit.
anybody know if these motors would make a flywoo explorer have longer flight times? https://www.getfpv.com/t-motor-f2203-5-1500kv-2850kv-3550kv-motor.html,"the ESC doesn't generate anything ESCs don't *generate* current, they allow it to pass, like a floodgate. The ESC can *handle* up to 30A, even if your motors don't *pull* any more than 15A the motor will only draw a set amount of current, and it's up to the ESC to safely let that current through"
So what is the theoretical scenario where a motor can get too much current and become damaged?,"being overloaded, or shorted"
Overloaded how? You said it takes only what it needs.,"too much load on it. pulling heavy stuff Every motor has a thermal limit, but it doesn't limit itself. If you ask too much of it, it will draw more current than it can handle, and it will smoke or being forced to spin when it can't spin. though that usually smokes the ESC first"
I assume the goggles are also set to R8?,"Testning it out now, i dont get any video in the gogglea Oh *FUCK* your goggles are so old that they don't support Raceband channel. FFS Fatshark I hate you so much :Harold:. i guess i shouldnt use raceband and ch8 No. You shouldn't. Set it all to F8 instead.

alright! and i just do that in the BLHeli configurator right?,ew stinky. we use bluejay yes. and follow what is written. use esc-configurator. :p
"so just  the website or just bluejay, or do i have to use both?","the website supports bluejay, blheli_s and am32 cause i have this one now: yeah that's outdated. you want to use the website you made me download it, lol. okee. thank youu"
i think my TH3 freestyle has BLHeli_S. does that work with bluejay?. or like do i need to flash another firmware?,yup you can flash blheli_s to bluejay. just take a screenshot of the settings first. is easy
which ESC out of the 4 options i have do i have to do this on?,"well. go one back. if you look at the current firmware. it says. and it probably selects the correct one by default ``` Unsupported Firmware JESC not supported, please use dedicated configurator.```"
:thinkies:. can you screenshot?,screenshot what. lmao the configurator. or your credit card details. whichever is more convenient after reading settings that's so weird :loudly_crying_face: im downloading the jesc configurator rn. apperantly its based on BLHeli
has jesc even been updated in the past years?. yeah it's paid. and really not that great,"last release: Aug 18, 2020. but the last commit was May28 2021 I mean... we could just flash it to bluejay"
would that ruin anything?,"but like this is weird, why the hell is emax sending you a quad with jesc lol"
or like is there risk involved when doing that to a bnf?,"@DædalusFPV @Vitroid :thinkies: idk :loudly_crying_face: there isn't this is just so funny and weird this is what jesc says just press flash all, S-H-90 and 48KHz. blast from the past"
"on all the motors it says normal direction, but arent 2 like reversed?",or is that their normal direction brushless motors are as simple as reversing two wires to make them spin opposites
what does this change btw?,BNFs generally just have CW AND CCW versions for their motors. well you flash them to bluejay. and then you have the new modern cool esc firmware
so the selected one?. oh cant read shit on that. lol,well you press flash all in esc-configurator. not jesc. silly theres only jesc. OHHH
so this?. whats wrong with blheli_s or is bluejay just better?,"blheli_s = old doesn't support all the cool things we use. bluejay = new open source active and updated and all the fun stuff but then i have to take off all my props to test it :/ JESC was pretty popular at one point, but yeah now there's no point it says it on the checklist i always wished i could afford jesc. it's a tinywhoop with propguards, normally it'd be dangerous but here you just kind of... hold it down"
"just flash or ""flash local firmware""?",just flash. if it wasn't a tinywhoop with propguards you would want to take off the props :thumbs_up:. it doesnt have propguards but its a2.5inch i think i can hold it down. ok so now we have this: yay yippee. now change that maximum startup power to like 1500 oh. put it in like the middle sure. you can also turn temperature protection back on
temperature proteciton to 140?,and then bottom right
how do i test if the motors spin?,you goes into betaflight. esc tab
into the motors tab?. and then i turn them on?,"one of my motors sounds weird :c. im sure its fineee just. just give it a little pat. y'know. some kisses to heal the wounds like it got entangled in a bush today. could be from that. but idk what would be wrong with it well yeah a motor sounding weird wouldn't really be from the esc. so lol okay so now what i actually came here for. the startup song yes so. the button isn't there :o theres so many songs mine is set to bad apple. and many more outside of that list too, people make them all the time"
do i synchornize melodies?,"so i just hit accept on all I don't remember, I think you want all 4 tracks separate. for certain songs"
i think so. ill just hit accept. it should be finee.. right?,wire melodies. is gonna be great
do i have to write settings again?. or can i just disconnect?,"you're fine after pressing write melodies i believe OMG. IT WORKED. i used x gon give it to ya. so cool. thankk youu better esc, better tunes. woohoo one of my motors sounds weird.. can you guys tell me if this is bad weird or acceptable weird  the 3rd one is the weird one if you couldnt tell, lol yeah that's not good. lol. or well, sounds not great. :thinkies:"
you mean the one at 0:11. ?. cause thats the 3rd one,yeahh. im taking off the prop rn to check i mean if it's the motor and nothing else then shrug
it still flies the same. motor doesnt get hot quicker than the others. what do you think is broken abt it?,"i dunno. it's just a sound. you could check inside the motor. but you risk losing the c-clip doing that. and you don't have a bag of replacements i have some replacement parts. but i dont think anything for the motor. why do they make it so hard to take off the props. god damnn. gotta use my whole strength, lol. the motors sounds like its rubbing against sth this is why i pick t-mount i was thinking it might be a small leaf or branch part from the bush. sadly i think its just broken. lol you can swap it out with another motor see if its the esc. but uh... that's just a sanity check"
because that definitely sounds like just the motor. connectors right?. or is it soldered,"oh well. order a replacement motor and rip it till it dies damn 7000kv motor for 12 bucks. emax is ripping me off pretty average price sadly alright, well, ill just have to wait and see. i think it should be fine. it wasnt really a crash, i just cruised into a bush At what voltage should I land my drone when flying above water. Right now I try to land at about 22.3 volt 6s pack yeah probably around 22 Volts land when hovering at 3.5v per cell oki thanks. I fly like 3-4 km out, so it's always a bit of a guess with wind/water.   But right now normally I head back when I see 22.5V   and then land at 22.1 /22.2    good to hear I can stretch it a bit more if necessary. you might want to just calibrate your mAh meter"
"this I should def do yes, you are right.   DJI's o3 voltage display is also trustworthy right?","Went on holiday in greece, and coated my quad just before.   Somehow didn't have OSD, but I did have the DJI OSD. Let's hope it was ok :face_with_tongue:"
why would beta flight complain about `Motor Protocol` if I alreadyst motor protocol?. is there other reason for complaining ?. and motors do rotate when I try vai master. but arming fails,can you select dshot300 and save I think I received the same error but lets double check. still motor protocol I bought the  Diatone Mamba MK4 H743 V2 + 55A 128K BL32  stack. should support dshot600 is it plugged in properly yes All motors work during calibration. I can literally turn them all on from the motor tab
when i buy a ESC/FC do some settings come preloaded on it or do i have to do EVERYTHING myself?,"try turning bidirectional dshot on. everything yourself, but uh everything isn't a lot and personally I can set a quad up in like 5 minutes oh alright, well.. yeah if you know what to tune etc. lmao i saw that there was likea website for like settings, but idk what its called default tune is good for 99% of builds, and otherwise other people make plenty presets. you don't need to know how to tune nowadays but what if i want to then you'd first have to set everything up anyways. only then you can tune. :p fair enough lol. im sure tuning would come in handy sometime. ohh right, theres presets in Betaflight. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  i just watched a video about someone upgrading their TH3 Freestyle, and they said it also had the JESC firmware on it. also unlicensed. lol"
that's so weird. blheli_s for the record doesn't even support bidirectional dshot (or didn't?),the reason people bought jesc is was because it did and it was amazing and fun and great partly because of it. <https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/dshot-rpm-filtering>
thanks!. ohh alright. thats pretty cool. is that enabled by default?,no. at least not that I know of still Bidirectional dshot didn't work for 600. trying for 300
"ohh i didnt know there were profiles, can i switch those outside of BF? like in the goggles or sth",yeah probably. do you have bidirectional dshot on
oh no let me turn it on and re-try. why ? I am not following,it's discontinued. and you can't easily update it anymore. and if you're even more unlucky you might not be able to change settings it still fails to arm. for the same reason
but like.. it seems best to have the newest one.. right?,"""fun"". doesnt sound good"
what version do you have now?,"most things should transfer over then this is getting funny @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) if this goes to shit then it's on you, I was just gonna go to bed last thing I have to try I guess... I enable this and I can arm from the remote. and it works! were you. trying tarm. trying to arm. with the usb plugged in"
"I know about the other arm fail reasons. but Motor protocol should not be in the list, no. ?",arming is intentionally completely disabled when connected over USB I am still pissed they renamed all the SPI options for no reason other than cosmetical. let's just break all the 4.3 and 4.4 diffs
but they say failed to arm because of Motor Protocil ?,"I mean it shouldn't even be necessary unless you're messing with the pin defs yourself there was another reason .... and I assumed that other reason was the USB all the tinywhoop manufacturers tend to include it in their diffs. and other stuff. i painstakingly translated them manually once it should be defined in the target already wasn't in that case, it was some super weird board if not... manufacturer is doing stupid stuff. not a firmware issue anyways, just do a lil `diff all` in the CLI, save to file, flash 4.5, copy paste the text from the file you saved into CLI, success! happymodel was quite happy to have many different dumps for different AIOs that shared the same target"
"i saved the stuff to a txt file. okay, if this fails i will cry myself to sleep. lol. when i auto detect does it set these aswell?. like can i leave them like this?","I tried disconnecting the usb, and no arming, th only case arming works, is with USB connected, and ""risk asscepted"". @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) you said you had few more ideas then you're good to go let me guess. you didn't replug the battery. after unplugging the usb no I always do. just in case"
"it says failed to open serial port, is that a problem?","yes :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: drivers. ``` set dshot_bidir = OFF set dshot_bitbang = OFF save ```. you can randomly try that. but then I'm out of ideas okay well it didnt flash it. it just said ""failed to open serial port"". then i disconnected and reconnected the cable and im back to the old one well yeah. you need drivers the STM32 DFU kind. <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe>. I'm sure this thingie has it well, it didn' work, but thank you what version of betaflight are you on"
"4.5.1. maybe that is the problem, if hardware is old, maybe I need downgrade ?",you shouldn't need to
is this it? https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html,can you go to the CLI. bottom right press submit support id. and copy the code and give it. no don't think so what about this thing:. theres some drivers
``` 2024-08-03 @00:32:15 -- Build server failure: HTTP 400  2024-08-03 @00:32:15 -- Build server failure: HTTP 400 ``` very funny. maybe my conigurator is old ? let me check,everything going wrong simulator no it is 10.10 which is latest. but there s no URL produced
oh i probably should have my drone connected for the driver updated right?,yeah and in bootloader mode that's how impulse works. `bl` in CLI or hold down the button while plugging in
"What are the best nd filters for the dji mini 2 se, and how do I use them. Are mcuv or cpl filters important, and what exactly do they do?",you just replug it. are you using expresslrs and have the arm switch on AUX 1
oh and do i have to be in bootloader to flash firmware? @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). probably yes but im just gonna ask anyway,"https://discord.com/invite/yAzf9vQC. You might want to ask here and give them the pastebin alright thanks a lot! They're really going to want that support ID though, it would've been easier for me to figure out what could be going on if you had it. yes but it does that automatically when you put it on bootloader manually you need to select no reboot or whatever when flashing And should I get filters that are pl and nd at the same time. Another question is whether it matters if the lens is a circle or the entire width of the camera."
":D. this is just the defaule config i had on my TH3 before, can i ignore the errors?. im just gonna ignrore the errors, itll be fineee",@Vitroid i told u. it annoying and confuzzlinf. bedazzling. shocking
"so do i need to do anything about that?. i found the default CLI files, but they have the same error: https://emaxusa2.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/19000156653-tinyhawk-iii-plus-freestyle-cli","resource defs shouldn't come up in a diff unless the manufacturer has been doing some silly things AFAIK well this is emax. soo yeahhhhhhhh. ignore them, it's fine. at least the resource ones i mean theres also the option to revert to 4.4 theres only the errors in the screenshot. otherwise its fine worst case we translate them to be what funky stuff emax did"
oh i actually wanted the 4.5 version to try the preset i was looking at anyway. so i think its fineee. this one. is that a good decision or not so?,"i'd select low build quality. lol. and enable rpm filter. and scroll down the guy in the video with the same drone, he took the medium one what a silly goober. turn on rpm filter, keep it on 48k, probably turn on dynamic idle. and then see if you can select what preset it go on"
? :thumbs_up:. or low?,yeah looks fine probably damn it. always more to set up. lol just press agree. turn it on after question is does it support it yes that's why we did the whole bluejay and everything thing. although jesc also did. lol ohh oke. i did it. yeahh the presets look fine. apperantly this guy is a professional tuner. yeahh should be good. thank you so much for helping @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)
what did people do with drones before there were communities like this?. like id actually be lost,"there always been communities like this. otherwise drones wouldn't exist yeah fair enough. but there was a time where no one knew how much you guys know now. lol. i really appreciate the help, its a lot easier to get into the hobby and less frustrating probably :) thank youu it helps that you can read properly lol yeah probably, lol, but i feel like you guys dont get enough appreciation for how much you help everyone, its actually insane how much knowledge you have, so thank you, thank you. i hope i can learn all of this quickly and then help others aswell :) @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) figured it out. I discharged the capacitor between power cycles. and the thing arms"
were you like speedrunning replugging that lipo?. the hell?,well. you need to. ``` set dshot_bidir = ON set dshot_bitbang = ON save ```. and set it back to DSHOT600 will do tomorrow. but thanks again^_^
Question like the tx16s it has a charging port does the boxer crush also have that or do I have to buy a traditional charger to charge the boxer crush battery?,it has a charging port And I can charge the li ion. Btw they released the crush in Getfpv It’s cheap. And it’s decent it's meh compared to the T15 in my opinion uhmm.. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  i just tried to arm my drone and test it rq after flashing the firmware and applying the preset and everything. i can arm it.. but as soon as i apply throttle it just.. flips backwards yeahh. slight suspicion. could you possibly help meee. lol everythin looks fine in BF i am sussy about that singular prop you had to put back on ill reload the backup from before the preset preset is just a tune and maybe the other weirdo settings
"wdym?. all the props were on the quad, i just took one off to check the motor. and then put i back",well it flipped backwards and that can only be a few things the motor spins just fine. i think are they spinning the correct way ohh. i have to check that. true. yes. theyre spinning the right way. the only thing thats different in the motor tab is the Bidirectional dshot do you randomly have the prop direction is reversed switch on
yes. should that be 600?,"no. is the order of the motors correct is forwards forwards and left left for the gyro. the 1, 2, 3 and 4 well yeah but in real life the accelorametor. its borken down is up. HAHAH yes borken how. help. down is up config tab. board and sensor alignment. have fun doing maths"
"okayy. :(. not funny. what is ""first gyro""?. but does the accelerometer make my quad flip?. it was in acro",yeah. you only need to touch the roll degrees and pitch degrees and yaw degrees normally but they seem to have changed first gyro
for my  exact issue. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeuSq71pYF0,so just yurn that back i guess. that video is just gonna show what we're doing now
okayy. soo what do we do now?. to default?. fixed it. 180 degrees on yaw. :),yuppee. yippee. now crash it into the ceiling okayy :). ill send an aftermath picture aymeric has a hole in his ceiling
but actually is there anything else i have to do?. or should it be fine?,shouldn't be. anything elze to do ok ill try. it works thank you for saving me @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) u now know how to debug like 99% of issues people get when updating or setting up quads thats cool :) thank you Should I get a bigger frame of my vtx hangs off the side. Moved from analog and seems small the fram idk
If it doesn't touch the prop and you're not worried about a highly specific crash? no,If you're worried put a little bumper on it so you feel better when flying
Do any of the walksnail transmitters record audio?. Remember seeing one message from someone mentioning that the vista or some other DJI transmitter did,"no. and I don't think any of the DJI ones do either. and frankly. i bet there's plenty teeny tiny microphone modules on alie. that cost like. 2 dollars. and have an sd card slot. lol Might just get some tiny action camera :PepeBigHmm: Are the TX16S sticks supposed to have a setscrew, because mine don’t.. I don’t see a way to adjust the length yeah i think so. :thinkies:. maybe not I think I can see a hex socket in some of the photos. Ah I can just steal the sticks off my qx7, those are the 2-part locking design. Hmm, though they’re less grippy I bought their 360 sticks because I couldn't handle being fucking stabbed by the stock tx16s sticks. and I really really like them"
Anyone know taller m3 sticks while we're talking about them?. I have the honeycomb ones but my huge ass hands still have an issue with how close they are to the transmitter,"Ah, they were in the bag with the hex wrench and extra springs it probably 3d printing time But they need to stab my fingers. I have considered 3d printing which I'll probably try but I'd rather have metal spikes of death get someone to resin print it. it'll be plenty stabby True. Wish I was at home so I could test and design stuff and figure out my needs"
"For anyone that's done a mob8/meteor85 to bassline conversion or owns both, is there really much noticable difference in performance just by swapping the frame?","Somehow i cant get to more then band ""2"" then it wont go further :p there's a big increase in performance removing ducts. there always is. don't really know if it's your goggles or if it's the vtx The last picture is VTX manuall can you show your vtx table in betaflight or whatever is on the quad I'm betting the VTX is locked for non-ham users, this depends on the VTX we're talking about though They have a pair of very old dominators that also seems to not be working the best, so there's a lot of factors i loaded the json file from this link into drone, https://github.com/Jackjan4/betaflight-vtx-tables/blob/master/tables/geprc/geprc-f411-stable-global.json like *ancient* dominators that don't even support raceband It all worked fine until i tried to get VTX settings and power it up to 200mW. But now after i tried with Fatshark band, and ch1 , 200mW i dont get any :unamused_face:. even tho i have the Frequency that the goggles should support"
what's it indicating according to the table?,"CH1 band A =5865. Blue 1 blink, Green 1 blink, Red 1 blink. when  i press more, it only goes up to ""2nd"" choice. Now i changed in betaflight i got it at CH1, BAND F = 5740"
"1 on red, meaning 25mW?",yea it should be even tho i have 200mW in VTX config. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). ops. This is Goggles table. so i should techichly have picture on Ch1
5740 would be fatshark 1. maybe try that frequency out?,iam no that but dont get any video :unamused_face:
Going through channels in the goggles. Should i try any of theese presets?,We don't really know. Your drone was manufactured before the wheel was invented. this is some old shit ye
Geprc smart 16 is it old?. i know the goggles got few years on them :p,"oh, no the drone seems fairly new, the goggles though 3 years old ain't so bad"
"woah, what are those? Is that a fatshark teleporter?. Does the headset work on other drones?",i think they got the goggles in 2022
wow yeah Teleporter V3. Do we have any way to check if the VTX is transmitting? It's hard to tell if the goggle see static or if it's just a plain white screen,"it worked on others and worked on this drone before i tried to bump up the mW to 200mW. hmm iam not sure but as above worked before i started to adjust settings Well that's easy, just upload your original config that you backed up before updating the quad"
Helloo i want to upgrade the toy e88 drone i got with esp32 wifi cam I am new and Idk how to go about it Would I need another battery to connect to it? How can I powet it? Would i be able just use the current putput of the default camera modulw which comes with it,"I don't think that'd be an upgrade. the esp32 cam is kind of meh in quality, especially if you want low latency. !toy Good command but unfortunately im broke then that's all the more reason to not waste your money dude"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  what would i need to do to a crux 3 1s to fit a 1s lite kit from WS. and another question is there a way to power the WS Goggles L with 1s batteries. Some sort of a splitter?,"When Vitroid say this, the confusion must be on a critical level"
"Hmm, tx and rx are still bound but no reaction from moment/ arming either in beta or irl. What could i have changed that made it not react anymore?","Drone and goggles worked fine until i started to get vtx power and settings optimal, and now aint the drone responding to stick movment :grimacing_face: The radio control and video links have nothing to do with each other Get a screenshot of the Ports and Receiver tabs i somehow had the red one on instead of Serial RX. But still have Video problems, if u have some experience i would love some help / troubleshooting ive made a thread. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1269223851334701098"
can you get a wider pic?. that doesn't look like a package for a 12V reg,Well im not sure what it actually is but it gets really hot wellll maybe it could be a 12V LDO. lemme see
"so total newbie here trying to gdive into this world.  bought a meteor 75, radiomaster pocket and some goggles.  how the hell do i get started with this stff?. ive pulled up a bunch of youtube videos and everything says to flash the whoop first.","that's probably the last thing you want to be doing. don't touch it Ive watched videos on setting up betaflight and expresslrs. im so lost atm let's just figure out how everything is set up from the factory and decide from there :PepeSheikhInshallah: safe to assume that the Pocket has a recent enough version of ELRS, but you should still at least give it a bind phrase. we can go over that now if you want to"
i watcvhed captn drone on binding the drrone to the transmitter.  but then the throttle didnt work. only side to side.. man i would love for any help.. shold i upgrade teh radiomaster pocket to 3.4 elrs?,probably no need. just connect to its wifi access point and get a screenshot of the web ui ok. i dont know how. it isnt putting out a wifi i can attatch to
do you know how to open the ELRS lua script?,"assume i know nothing. i started last week. im technical. i do IT for a living. i know what a lua script is. and i see it downloaded one in the expresslrs tool okay. the radio should have a SYS button, that should take you to a page that shows the various lua scripts installed on the radio among some silly games, there should be an ELRS script ya. express lrs adn a bunch of games you need to open the ELRS script, go to WiFi connectivity, and then Enable WiFi that should start a WiFi AP called ExpressLRS TX 4 options. enable wifi, enable rx wifi, enable backpack wifi, enable vrx wifi. i clicked on the enable wifi the first one like I said. the password for it the wifi network is `expresslrs`. when you connect to it, open up 10.0.0.1, and get a screenshot/photo of the top of that page it says wifi runnin on the Tx. but i dont see it on either of 2 computers i have here. wait! good, you can enter in a bind phrase. it's not a security thing, just something that makes the process easier. anything you can remember"
we do a similar thing on the drone. do you know if it has a Serial or SPI receiver?,"i believe it is serial. The latest F4 1S 5A flight controller is applied to all BNF versions of Meteor75 Pro. It features Serial ELRS 2.4G instead of SPI ELRS 2.4G for ELRS version compared to the previous version. Note: For Serial ELRS 2.4G, the Betaflight firmware 4.3.0 and up start to support BMI270 gyro when you leave it powered on for 60 seconds, it should make its own AP called ExpressLRS RX. same password, and get a screenshot"
"ya, ive had the quad sitting here bt it doesnt make a hotspot. i can connect to the quad via usb cable. but i havent see a wifi from it yet. is there another way other then wifi?","yeah. also. do not watch drone camps, basically a scam channel. just use the official guides. <https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases/download/v1.7.2/ExpressLRS-Configurator-Setup-1.7.2.exe> this is just so confusing to start have it. im staring at it neat. I don't know what the target is for the tinywhoop, but I'm guessing it'll be along the lines of ""betafpv 2.4"" and ""betafpv aio"" vitroid helped me flash the radio.  im stuck on the drone.  its not making a wifi yeah. neat. then select betaflightpassthrough. ISM_2400 as the regulatory band. put in the same binding phrase as the radio"
i hook a battery p to the whoop and connect to teh pc ?,"nah no battery. just make sure you have betaflight configurator and all that closed. then plug it in ok. expresslrs doesnt detect the device in the device selection expresslrs should pick up that the whoop is plugged in and automatically select it there. it doesnt.. if i open betaflight, it will see the flight controller .  expresslrs doesnt.. i don't get it"
i don't think I have ever seen it automatically select. show the options. does it scroll? :thinkies:. what does it show up as in device manager?,device manager was as good idea.  i had it open as i plugged the drone in. saw it grabbed com7.. used that in expresslrs to connect to the quad and send the flash.  it said successfull
ok then i have other problems. quad is connected to teh tx now. so thats good. but i have no forward throttle. no lift.. i have a dead stick forward adn back. btu it works side to side?,open up betaflight and go on the receiver tab. then hold the model button on your transmitter till it pops up the menu and show the mixes tab
no?. no connecting the tx to the pc,"ok. no quad or tx connected to pc. i open betaflight i dont have any tabs well you connect the quad to the pc so you can see betaflights configurator ic ok. ya im sorry. im trying to sponge info up.. ok i see the tx in betaflight. the bars move when i move the sticks.. i really dont get it. throttle left, the props spin as if trying to turn the drone.   same with right.  throttle up, it's just dead.. i can fly in the sims"
all good dude.. feels like i'm close to flying. not sure why my throttle is not working.  do i need a different profile in the tx?,"@Velvethammer sorry I had to dip, had an urgent fix for the Configurator come up. I'll just make the PR and we can have a look at what's wrong"
okay let's do this. do all the sticks respond to the correct channels shown in the Receiver tab?,i'll get it connected again but it was. ok rdy. yes the bars move as i move the sticks
does moving the throttle axis actually move the throttle bar?,"same with all the rest okay. get a screenshot of the Motors tab and a photo of the drone throttle down. throttle up and the Modes tab, sorry I forgot hi, when i plug in 2, 1s 650mAh batteries, my quad recognizes it as 3S, its a 2s quad, the two batteries arent of the same kind, but theyre almost identical, both HV 1a 650mAH, is that fixable or should i justr not use different batteries (I have a TH3 Freestyle still with the 2 ph2.0 connectors which i will replace soon)"
get a screenshot of the Power & Battery tab. any other modes that have a range?,just flip over after crash.
"of the whole thing. is it currently active?. set Max Voltage to 4.35 or a bit higher. yeahhhhhh that'd do it. when that mode is active, the motors will be reversed to produce thrust in the opposite direction to allow you to flip over, and throttle is disabled","it still says 3S once it goes over like 8.7 Volts maybe i just shouldnt use not identical batteries, lol give it like 4.35-4.37 nah that's not the issue. have the mode be not enabled. move the switch that activates it, or remove the range"
"oh yeah, now it switches between 3s and 2s as the voltage goes up/down. so i think 4.37 per cell is like the border. so should I increase it a bit more or is that dangerous?",no it's fine. all that setting does is to go towards calculating the cell count and some other averages
what does the max cell voltage do? is that just for the OSD?. like calculating voltage?. ohh alright,"Betaflight doesn't know how many cells you have, it just sees the total voltage. it uses the max and min values to divide it ohh alright thank you :)"
"wouldnt that throw off my /cell voltage on the OSD when i just increased it, like when i fly with the old batteries that showed 2s when i used them before?. like i have 3 identical ones and then 1 different one that at first i was just using for testing, ik its weird.. lol","no, it's only used to divide the total voltage Betaflight is to update drone receiver firmware right no that is. that is not what betaflight is for"
For what. But it does that?,Betaflight *is* the drone's firmware. Betaflight configurator is to configure / flash betaflight (but not necessarily the receiver firmware). And the ELRS configurator for exemple is to update the firmware on an elrs receiver
@Vitroid  @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  ty tytytytytytytyty  that flip over mode was the culprit.. is there a video on how to connect the ev8000 goggles to the quad ? :slightly_smiling_face:,"get a screenshot of the Video Transmitter tab. set the goggles to F-4. using the BAND+ and CH+ buttons. Band F, Channel 4 ok. for real. that is a lot harder to fly then i thought it would be.  fun though!. thank you guys so much for the help. that is a mountain of intimidation to get over."
"Hey, i have a quick question about soldering, if i have rosin core solder (63/37) do i still need extra flux or should that be fine? i only want to solder 2 pinhole connectors/pads on the esc (desolder the old ones to solder a new connector on)","if it's quality solder its TBS rosin core 63/37 the flux inside should be enough. i mean if it isn't, you'll know anyways. so yeah but i was asking to know if i should buy solder now. before trying it lol not solder. flux. sorry. lol yeah you should. you'll need it at some point. make sure it's no-clean"
"yeah fair enough, also would you recommend solder wick (or whatever its called) or a solder pump? from what ive seen a wick works better usually",wick is better for the typical FPV use when you get skilled enough you can even take it outdoors for some fun. https://youtu.be/3fhgAWU2rwo
"what vtx is on that quad?. nvmd, its in the description. lol. wait this works with any Protocol? <https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2021/07/27/happymodel-ovx300-ovx303-5-8g-40ch-300mw-vtx-openvtx/>  @Vitroid","it's an analog VTX, it will work with all analog goggles on the website it said this: ""Either protocol can be used on the flight controller and on VTx power up the protocol used is automatically detected by OpenVTx."" oh, that's for the configuration of the VTX. like remotely setting the power and frequency. that kinda stuff"
"ohh. okayy. that wouldve been too good to be true, lol. is there even such a VTX that can be used with multiple goggles (e.g. hdzero and walksnail and such) ?","yes and no. you can add an analog video receiver to HDZero and Walksnail goggles, so they can work with analog Does anyone know why the screen is clipping like that"
Fair enough. How could I correct this?. It's the same when I set my goggles to 4.3,move them inwards a bit
where can i adjust flight controls in betaflight? i have a drone with controls different than my others and its unflyable to me for this reason. nvm i managed to get it,Hey does anyone know if i can use my dx6i transmitter to fly quadcopter or is it ment for planes and helicopters ohh alright :) thank you
Question when I put a customize bind phrase into my controller and put that same bind phrase to my receiver does it automatically bind?,Assuming they're the same version and model match isn't setup they should
Ok. Or do I also have to press the bind button in my Lua script?,"Nah, bind is if you prefer to bind the traditional way by using the bind button on the receiver. I haven't tried this myself, but it probably sets the receiver to the transmitter's bind phrase, or something similar. I'm not entirely sure on that part"
I’m more positive to stick to stick with bind phrases. That’s how Joshua bardwell does it. Same version of firmware?,I believe same major version but yeah definitely worth keeping them updated though

"hey guys, i don't fly my mavic air 2 often, my smart remote is stuck on an old version and will not update from within the smart remote anymore. I download dji assistant 2 version 2.0.14 but can't get it to connect to the remote at all - any ideas?","so I'm making a Lithium Ion battery pack, and silly UPS lost my package with the nickel strips I was gonna use, so I wanted to ask, can I use some 18awg wire to connect the cells or is that a terrible idea"
"Is it possible to use 2 walksnail cameras on my wing, one front facing and one rear facing and being able to switch between the cameras using a switch on your radio for example?","I relieve I used some left over motor wire for mine, it works fine. The problem is attachment. You can't really spot weld wires soldering on battery my beloved no. it's only possible on analog. and in a very specific way on DJI No.  However. If you had the goggles bound to one VTx, and another cam/VTx bound to a standalone WS VRx plugged into the goggles HDMI input..... It's a stupid solution, but technically possible."
not available for purchase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXefxwMJncc,"Yeah, but it's an abomination of a solution."
Are These Motors only for 4s or could they also do 6s?,that kv is way too high for any reasonable 6s build
And 2900kv? Would be good?,"still a little too high imo Hmmm, maybe 2 cams, 2 vtx's and 2 screens with both a vrx might be the solution for now then (but expensive lmao)"
When I put the bind phrase via configuration app? Or wifi tab 10.0.0.1?. Or do I have to put it manually on my controller,"Ive asked this question before, but I cannot seem to locate the response in the search function. On the hota d6, the Li-ion function to charge only goes up to 4.10v Is it ok to use the Lipo function to get it up to 4.2 (it is a 4.2v) pack. yea just make sure its charging slow older Li-Ion cells would only go to 4.1V ty. perfect thank you for confirming. ye i was going to charge it at 2.5a"
is it a 5000mah liion?,"yea that should be fine or 2.25 if u want a good .5c One fixed front facing camera, the other one being able to look around which seemed cool to me. I saw a video of it on youtube and thought it maybe would be possible to not have it all seperate why not just have one camera on a gimbal that can turn 180 degrees that'd be spending too little money and make to much sense. unless your like recording under you the whole flight + need something to see from. like if ur mapping or smth The gimbal is in the bottom of the plane, to take aerial shots. And then 1 front facing. But I guess just 1 on the gimbal works well enough too. The budget is there, but if it's not needed, it's not needed. Everything in fpv is already expensive on its own :grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat: Do I need the hobby wing fc and esc to use the osd or can I use osd when using the vtx standalone you need a FC to get osd. doesnt matter what FC (as long as it has an OSD chip) How do I connect the osd, it only has power input and camera input. And then some legs at the bottom camera goes to video in on the fc. video out on fc goes to camera in on vtx Ahhh ok, but what are the legs for on the bottom of vtx. They are a little in the way for where I want to mount the vtx which legs. probably to plug into some FC that they make"
So I can unsolder them?,is quite weird. how they made it so much taller Yea. Had never seen a vtx with the legs in any of the videos before the box has the name of their stacks on it. so I'm guessing their xrotor stuffs have pins that accept it. I assume racers would use that. it's kind of neat
"Ok, cool. https://www.getfpv.com/axisflying-argus-eco-stack-f405-fc-55a-6s-blheli-s-esc.html  Does anyone know if this comes with screws and capacitor and battery cable, etc.?",thats a link to your shopping cart I realized that. I’m fixing it GetFPV is often overpriced fyi It’s abt 60 bucks everywhere I doubt it does. nowhere in the pictures or description
"hey, I was wondering if can i fit all soldering tips into every iron, or are there like company specific tips or something?","nahh. that's a really low price for a stack of such spec in fact, it's a 100 dollars on other sites"
"also.. do i actually need ventilation if my solder contains lead, or is that just recommended and only needed for people that solder A LOTT?",ive been huffing mine the lead isn't why you need ventilation
"oh, i thought that was why, is it the flux?","the flux is, and yes you do need it or your eyes will hurt and your lungs will burn... just buy a cheap 12v fan and a carbon filter and it shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks"
"ohh okay, that doesnt sound fun, so its enough if i just blow it away from me?",naw you can't. you're either holding your breath (which doesn't fix the eye problem) or just dying. oh you mean like with a fan. yeah. it is but your room will fill up
like wont it still bee.. in the room?,unless you use a carbon filter
"wouldnt it be more effective to suck the fumes towards a window, than to blow them around in my room?",then i dont need a carbon filter :) you just don't want them in you. or around you. lol i have a bunch of PC fans laying around. im sure i could build a contraption my favorite thing to order in bulk on alie. are usb-pd trigger boards
"these? <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806810933610.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.1a58622f622fLg&algo_pvid=1f3e6741-6e31-4345-b22b-efb395eca068&algo_exp_id=1f3e6741-6e31-4345-b22b-efb395eca068-1&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%212.26%210.94%21%21%212.38%210.99%21%40211b6c1917228043396851328e121a%2112000038991429136%21sea%21AT%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=RBtsrKQIJZp1&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt>. what do you use them for?. oh, to power a fan with usb-c. but to build that.. i need to solder :O. cant escape the fumes","to power anythiiing. it's so convenient to be like. ""oh i need to power this thing at least semi-permanently"". just yoink out the trigger board. and boom"
"ohh thats so cool. oh so about the tips, can i just put any soldering tip into any iron?. or are there ones that dont fit certain soldering irons?. also, i ordered some xt30 connectors, is it normal that its almost impossible to pull them apart? like at that point i can just solder it, should it have that tight of a bond? lol","The Pinecil is compatible with all TS-style tips Check if they're genuine with the Amass logo and such, and yeah they're meant to get looser over time but start out impossible yeah theyre amass. ohh alright. i just used some pliers to hold it and pull on the other one make sure they're orang too. like a good orang the black stuff is from my pliers. lol i just pull on the wire, it's both a test of ""did i solder well"" and ""is this silicone  wire too weak"". might be cursed i meann.. if it holds lol. yeah but tbh its not really better with the ph2 connectors i have rn, i just tug on the wire, although after some time they have become easier to remove how would one recommend me holding a single propeller and bldc down without it flying away and ripping my face off for an experiment"
"plenty people have that, should be great. why?. death","I've heard that some FC with that gyro have bad design and have problems with gryo nois. I have opportunity to by this FC for good price and I want to now if it's any good. The Mamba stacks should be designed well, I haven't heard anything bad from them and I think they worked with BF."
What about 1.6”. Scrapes?. Slight cuts I assume,i wouldnt wanna touch it. well.... maybe
I got this reciever and one oif the antennas broke off can i still use it without damaging it or affecting the range?. https://www.racedayquads.com/products/happymodel-fli14-2-4ghz-flysky-compatible-rc-receiver,"Do I have to change anything in bf if I 180 my esc Those donut props weigh nearly nothing and are very fragile. I'd put those in 3"" territory for damage done. (Which, from personal experience, is bad enough.)  I'd wager a good set of well built, low/med pitch freestyle props with sweepback tips would do **significantly** more damage.  They'll spin faster and carry waaay more momentum. Basically nothing ime, maybe a slight scrape, I hand tossed my 75mm duct less a few times, and it didn't always end well Scrape, if you're unlucky. There's so little mass to those props, and so little power in the motors that they just stop dead. It hurts a little, but doesn't break my calloused skin.  No, I didn't test it on purpose, I'm just an idiot. Likely just motor order and motor direction If the motor is going at 100% throttle, even if the prop doesn't carry as much momentum (which it does, the donut is 4.3g, that's hardly ultra light, the v2s is 3.8g for example), the motor is still exerting torque, and I already got hit by my 5"" with some v2s props on, just not at full throttle so I didn't bother to include it, but I didn't get any more damage, besides, even if the donut broke, it's not like it instantly looses all momentum and becomes a wet noodle instantly, it's still reasonably stiff and it's actually kinda sharp (at least sharper than my v2s). And the donut is the same pitch as the v2s, even if it has somewhere between 2 and 4 blades, it's not going to spin significantly slower Those donuts self destruct on a heavy landing. They're more of a frag risk than anything else :face_with_tears_of_joy: They only destruct if you hit them, and ye no shit, I flown 3 packs of them (fucking awful props by the way) and again, even if they break at the tip, it doesn't mean it instantly makes the blades just some wet noodles, it's still PC and it's still stiff-ish I got some for shits and giggles. I got 2 packs out of the first set I played with. They are indeed shit tier for durability. Yeah, and they fly terribly too, I hate them, I largely prefer my v2s, or occasionally some hq4play (I should try the 4.8x3.7x4 now that I think about it) Got 5.1x3.5x3 on there atm, they feel nice. Good power, nice control."
"For long range, to have the smallest chance of packet loss.  Is it best to get the EP1 Dual ELRS Reciever by Happymodel  Or the Matek ELRS Dual Receiver  Or the RP4TD ELRS Diversity receiver?","never get a Matek receiver. You want a receiver with Gemini idk what gemini is :crying_face: which includes the RP4TD, but also others make them too like Happymodel and BetaFPV. <https://www.expresslrs.org/software/gemini/>"
"So RP4TD or Happymodel, one of the two seem to be a solid choice?",soon we'll also have dual 2.4GHz and 900MHz Hold on give me some time to read it. I'm now heavily wondering if the RP4TD slightly is better or the Happymodel Dual and they both seem to be about the same True but shipping is crazy How should I go about soldering these big wires
"Does GNB make good lipos? And if so, which ones?","yes they do I believe anything with the flower pattern are their new ones which are actually good from my understanding the 700mah will have a little more capacity, but the 650mah is an HV which has higher voltage levels i think the 700mAh is a lot heavier in that image because of the extra protection material HV isn't very useful on bigger cells, you sacrifice a lot of durability. which sucks"
kind of?. the mAh rating is most likely with the HV part in mind,"higher voltage = more power, but it also = faster battery decay. what specifically does it change. like what effect does the HV have on the mah I'm guessing the advertised capacity is made in mind with it being able to charge to 4.35v instead of 4.20v. so if that were the case and you would only charge to 4.20v, you'd be losing capacity. LiHV are actually just LiPo's with cells that are tested and rated to be able to be on 4.35v, it still isn't very good for them to be at that high of a voltage though oh I think I see what you mean. ah ok"
Thanks. And how about These for my LR Quad?,I'm not confident those are good enough
It’s better than double posting ig? But it still kinda is… who knows,I'm too petty to answer their question now I’m to tired to continue this conversation now
"I contacted the support about my Walksnail Moonlight and the footage looks just like this out of the googles, maybe even worse and their answer was. no way this is normal. here is the video https://youtu.be/N_yLmtKxRW4. can anyone tell me if this looks normal to you?. okay maybe I need to record it in a higher res to see the noise better but is very bad",I mean you have it set to 720p there's not much we can judge here ill record in 4k and reupload it okay maybe a higher quality isnt possible because its the footage recorded from the googles but thats how it looks when I start recording. If I am not recording everything looks fine i guess @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)
what time in the day is this?,It was even worse than this in the live feed
does this have to do with settings?,because the noise isnt there at all when I am not recording but it starts after recording and continuous until I power cycle. ill tryna make a photo of the settings that's really fucking weird actually. https://discord.gg/SauyVwtC. join this and tell them + give them the clip btw this is the 4k footage. look how grainy and noisy it is yeah not normal. join the WS discord okay. Sivis Joe from the support of walksnail said is fine:skull: imma talk to them until they admit its not fine haha
Sure it's not just low light conditions?,no its not. its malfunctioning
Did it look different before?,look here what i wrote :/ so anoying that i cant record
Yeah that is kinda weird. So you're seeing the noise on the goggle side?. Where is it recording from?,@tntexplodes101 or look at this. there literally cant be more sun than this. it even was 30°C outside. yes and its extreme. its way worse in life video feed from the googles than both recording from googles and vtx like bruh what the fuck is this grainy and noisy stuff in the footage
"Looks like it's losing some precision in the colors for some reason, like it has the general shape but some bits are not correctly sent or something. Just to check what's the setup rn, recording DVR from what goggles and which VTX?",settings shouldnt really play a key role here tho. problem continuous even when stop recording ah walksnail moonlight kit and goggles x
And this only happens when you initiate recording on the goggles side?,"yes. there is no noise and any grain whatsoever when i dont record I don't know the system that well, but maybe it's worth checking some settings in the VTX, especially if this is the only combination that causes the issue nah I wont waste any further time with this broken vtx or camera. ill just buy dji o3 air unit and if caddx wants to help me then okay and if not then not. They say the first impression counts the most. and yeahh walksnail only had problems for me Send an email to them, then you'll get a hold of an actual rep and they are usually have more desire to keep customers"
What you guys think about the Radiomaster Crush?,"I think that it should have released 9 months ago when I bought my boxer. Cause those ag01 gimbals are really nice, and for only 40$ extra it's a pretty good deal and I love the pink shell, and I don't need to big screen of the t15, and afaik the half metal gimbals of the t15 aren't as good as the ag01 Ok thanks, gonna buy one:grinning_face_with_sweat::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
Ok. So couldn’t people just buy a new face plate?,"no, the colored shells aren't available separately. and it has AG01 gimbals for a very low price Wish you could chose the gimbal color Why are there two positive and negative inputs"
how much should i strip off of the wire for a pinhole connection? the screenshot is the esc i have. is this enough?. i wanna solder the + and - for the battery connector on the right,"I would strip a little bit more, but it just needs to go all the way through the pcb, and eventually stick out a tiny bit"
"alright, and if i put it through from the bottom then i just put a blob at the top aswell, right?","You just stick it through the hole (after tinning it) without solder, then add solder"
do i need to tin only the wire or also the pinhole somehow?,"You tin the wire, feed it though the hole, then you solder it"
"also do you guys use a grounding wire or some stuff like that?. like so youre grounded when soldering, or can that not damage anything?","You are supposed to do it, but I don't bother alright :) thank you. yeahh, i think for now ill just risk it If you have the ground wire thingy might as well use it if i had one, id use it i just dont wanna buy one"
"There’s lots of things it can be, do you have any more information?",Can someone help me my vtx doesnt work
how exactly does it not work? are you just not getting video? and is it just out of nowhere?,"Is it on the same channel, is the antenna connected, what MW power is it (or is it on pit mode) Its connect to my goggles but it has no video"
So it shows a gray screen plus text?,No only a grey screen. Without text
is your antenna connected right?,"If you aren’t getting video or osd, but it’s connected, I have no clue…"
did it happen after a crash or just out of nowhere?,Make sure you're on the right band and channel
Is it a BNF or did you build it?,"Someone build it and i buy it from him Ok so the OSD might not be set up in betaflight There should be default stuff OSD is the on screen display like the text of flight time etc. Okey. Im not home right now im tryinh it later on bf Grey screen without text can either mean the camera is unplugged or damaged and the osd wasn't set up or the vtx is damaged. If we had osd, we could rule out the second and it would just be the camera is unplugged or broken. (it could also be that the vtx isn't connected to the flight controller)"
How do i check that the camera is plugged right in?,"or that the VTX just isn't getting any video By opening it up and checking if the plug is well seated, if it doesn't change anything then check the pinout of the fc and see if it matches the camera's pinout (red is V+ (may it be 5v, 9v etc) black is for gnd/ground, yellow is signal/cam) Yeah I said that > (it could also be that the vtx isn't connected to the flight controller) vtx isn't getting any video Cause it's not talking to the fc, which gives it the osd and video Oh I’m used to the camera being plugged into the vtx and not the fc… No, some pass through the vtx. Like the c03 and m03 well that's just extra effort. nothing to do with the vtx But usually the cam passes through the fc to the vfx Ok. Yeah maybe it’s just the VTX’s connection to the FC Yeah it useless but on some BNF like the meteor line it is already plugged in that's done even with the c03 and m03, just in a weird way Alright thanks im ckecking it later Cam goes through the vtx to the fc and back to the vtx, so just extra steps for nothing"
But plugging the camera directly to the fc requires an extra UART right?,No. It goes through the cam pad
I can't view any blackbox file. Whats wrong?,Why are there two positive and negative inputs
wdym. sooo anyway do u have starter recommendations that arent fpv? im leaning towards the dji mini 2,it was just to get whoever was online and not doing anything to see if they could help me out... its not that deep lol it also took you 13 hours lol
Anyone know what could cause this?,I was trying something at the ports tab and it delete all port and now it wont bind with my controller Turn on serial on the correct port You motors are broke or the just not set right in bf increase the startup power in the ESC settings Even with throttle it does that
was that easier than making a screenshot? lol,"please make a screenshot, it's impossible to read Why is ibus on. What receiver do. You have then go on your laptop dude. you literally have. you sent look up https://www.discord.com you sent an image of you being on your laptop I dont have discord on my laptop. Anywas you can log in online Okey. But what shound i do now with my ports tab if we could see what it says we could tell you @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) where can I find the start up power section"
there's only one menu?,This is all I can see that's. not esc settings https://esc-configurator.com/
how to i take a screenshot?. on my laptop. :slightly_smiling_face:,windows + shift + s. and then select where you want the screenshot Ooh I see I'll mess around with it tomorrow theres a slider for the minimum and maximum startup power. so yeah you gotta adjust that
so what im gone do now?,What receiver do you have
And what uart is it wired to?,Can you show your flight Controler from the top. like he wants to see which uart its connected to Yeah i want to see where wich wire goes where
wait actually. @Scootzronnn did you build that drone yourself?. or or is it a bnf?,cause then we can just find the config online It selfmade. But i dont build it
did you buy it from a stranger?. or a person you know?,Uart 1. Turn on serial on the top one. 2nd to top. Sorry Bro. The cabrl. Cabel you can go back to betaflight Wrong cable. Yes go back to betaglight. Oh and remove your props But the cabel isnt connect. Yes you can close the drone. and plug in your usb-c I see tho blacks should be fine and then connect to betaflight
Doesnt matter this one?,That's for the video or your gps
has this drone flown before?,like im sure you wouldve tested it before buying I think. I removed the pros. Props Alright. So go to betafligjt
im back on beta flight. What im gonna do now?,Judging by the VTX and RX mounting system I'm not super confident in that thing
@Mr.melted is that right?,oh yeah then just turn on uart 1. like the first switch. and then go to your receiver tab yes. then go to your receiver tab. and send a screenshot of that. yeah. now to the receiver tab. not ports. brother. your receiver tab ah. sry. false scrren yeah looks good. then you can bind your receiver if its not already bound. and then test if it works on the receiver tab. oh and make sure to save your ports. it looks like you didnt hit the save button make sure that your ports are saved And my vtx is peeping  or something. It is
huh. your vtx is beeping?,"Idk. My drone is beebing. Idk it comes from the reciver or something hm go through your tabs again and check if everything is set correctly. heres a website on how to set it up btw <https://oscarliang.com/setup-expresslrs-2-4ghz/#:~:text=To%20setup%20ExpressLRS%20RX's%3A,CRSF%E2%80%9D%20in%20Serial%20Receiver%20Provider.>"
should i wait 2 months to get myself a darwinfpv babyape pro v2 or 6 months for a iflight nazgul eco?. or maybe something else?,"those are completely different drone classes. neither of which are recommended for beginners really. for different reasons. darwinFPV being incredibly garbage quality. and the nazgul eco being of good quality, but a 5"""
need help updating naked go pro... its powered directly from the drone and is saying need more than 20% battery to do the update.. the drone battery is fully charged is there a way to bypass this so i can install the update?,"Get a toothpick or a 3” or 3.5” max, always practive in a sim like Velocidrone for example first so, controller problem here. I am trying to set up LOS flying, and I have telemetry sending to the controller. I have (or think I have) the controller to beep or whatever at 3.6v, and i am also trying to set up a screen with the telemetry data. I have the screen set up, but I do not know how to *view* the screen.... I cycle through the screens with the mdl and up/down and can’t find it. But I’ve got a display set up"
Is pit mode on?. Oh it isn’t,"uhh whats that. im pretty new to fpv soo.. :loudly_crying_face: It is where it makes the vtx power to 0, so it doesn’t fry the electronics. Maybe try switching the channel and band to raceband (R) and 8 k ill plug it in see what happens And do the same on the goggles (or press search). The drone sends out the video signal, but it can be interrupted by Wi-Fi and stuff, so switching channels can help some…"
How far can it fly now?,but it turns black after a while. it always connects like this. lemme try flying it around
It’s analog right? Or digital,completly black and static when still in range. analog yeah Is it black or is it static yeah no it still cant go far Wait. Is your antenna connected
it glitches between the 2. on the goggles?. or the vtx,Both. Drone and goggles lemme double chec the vtx again. yeah it is in Huh weird. I don’t know what else it could be cuz like this only happens when the vtx is calibrated. lemme show you rq. so im disabling uart 2. so the vtx isnt connected What do you mean “VTX is calibrated”
I don’t think you need to calibrate it? Who did you hear from that it needs calibrated,"no cuz like. i wanted to change the VTX power from 100 to 200. cuz the range was so bad before I’ve never calibrated a vtx before and I’ve had 3 that worked just fine. You don’t need to calibrate it to change the power, you just do it uhh. wb when you change the settings in betaflight. cuz when the vtx isnt calibrated like rn it shows this in the vtx setting. i cant change anything I have no clue…. The bottom line says “press save to fix this” so maybe try that. Oh wait. The top button says wiki not save. I have no clue… :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) (pinging you cause i see you around often and you know drones…) oh shi. wiat. i think the antenna was off by like a bit it clicked when i pushed it in. lemme try. one sec. pray for me :loudly_crying_face: :folded_hands: It is dangerous (to the electronics) if the antenna wasn’t connected its still not working"
How long have you had the drone on before this?. Because long times of not having an antenna fully connected can cook it,"no the antenna has always been on but this all started when i calibrated the vtx. like 2 days ago Oh. What do you even mean by calibrate the vtx. What does that entail connecting it to the flight controller cuz i cant change anything on this vtx unless its calibrated. it doesnt show anything about the vtx signal on the osd either I can’t really help much further, someone more experienced might have to help you :loudly_crying_face:. alr. np. do you know anything who might be able to help I don’t know… only hope is wait for someone who wants to try to help… the vtx was at 25 mW.... i changed it with that button. now it works. :loudly_crying_face:. sorry for wasting ur time lmao It should still have not range than 10 feet with 25mw. It’s fine. I’m wasting my own time lol bro if i put the drone behind my back it lost connection. i think the goggles are just weak ash"
What setup is it?. (Drone and goggles),"ev800 :loudly_crying_face:. and baby ape 3 Same, the goggles aren’t that bad with the flysky fs i6. i went full budget on this. and i regret it. its alright. its too heavy and uncomfortable wearing it Yeah if you don’t spend a lot in the beginning, you are gonna spend a lot more later on. Yeaaahhh that’s the one thing I dislike about them yeah i thought everyone meant that cuz ppl would just buy more drones or transmitter or wtv so i didnt really listen to them. thats why i went the cheapest things. and i hate it sm :loudly_crying_face: I’m on my third drone… first one was just shit, I didn’t do any research. Second one I spend like a lot on, $500. It broke when I lightly tapped a chair… then the third one is finally good. The controller I am SO glad I picked the one I did. Then goggles, the ev800d are the best for the price, next best are $250"
"In total, over 1k. Just drones? Like $500 (but batteries too, those make it more). Jumper t-lite","damn. i prob spent like 3ish hundred in total. im planning on selling my flytsky and spend more to get the radiomaster pocket That’s how much I spent in the start. Then the camera broke. Then the frame. Then the drone kinda crapped out. Bought a new one. Exploded upon a light tap. Then I waited 4 months and got the one I do now. And it’s finally good quality and hasn’t broken yet (except one propeller, and a small manufacturing issue the company is replacing). Good idea ohh nice nice. yeah i already put it on marketplace Anyways, my question (unanswered) from before it got buried. If anyone is familiar with controllers. i regret listening to it"
It did warn you twice tho?,"i know. im letting others know.... dont listen to it. its not worth your sanity Hey guys, anybody know why this could be happening... Nazgul 5 eco. Oh crap I'm out video space..."
starting off deprop that guy if you're bench testing it. any warnings in betaflight about issues?. Sounds like you've just got your buzzer on,Yea it was the buZwr. Thanks I got it... Flying! Woot This is not the place to be shitposting. Keep it in #memes or don't do it at all.
Why is memes age restricted? Is there inappropriate stuff there or is it just a precaution,"because it contains stuff that could be deemed for people 18 and over ok, makes sense. hiding secrets from me... oh well. i bet i dont wanna see that stuff anyways yup, that's the real reason"
My Osd does not show my link quality for my radio any ideas? the system is runcam wasp. Im using Elrs,Woah someone under 18 honest about their age
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  remember that we talked about my malfunctioning walksnail moonlight where everything is grainy and noisy?,Yeah so support told me its normal. Bruh. I think he doesnt understand that the problem happens when I press recording
"Surely that can't be right?. This is from my o3, it's log, not colour graded.",https://youtu.be/6niUfYhMKoo  Look at this shit. Like wtf is this grainy ass video from my recording with no editing at all
That's not too bad? Have you tried what they said,Ill tryna do what that guy from support said with 2D DNR and 3D DNR settings... I've seen that moonlight video b4 defo didn't look like that
But like how does this happen when i press recording. Has the 2D DNR and 3D DNR  something to do with recording?,I can't help u here! I was just surprised at that pic quality from the newest kit. You tried youtubing 2 dnr and 3d dnr see what others have done and the results Ill do that and bruh if it doesnt work then fuck caddx and Ill sell all that shit from caddx I have. Didnt like it since the begining anyways. Only problems on my side
yes?. we went over this. and I told you to ask in the Walksnail Discord. stop being like this dude,"No one helped. They ignored me The videos on YouTube doesn't look like your footage. I'm sure it's something you can fix.. You got this!. Trust me all systems have there problems when you first join the hobby you just got to figure them out. I spent over 20 days trying to work out why my dji o3 was shaking like a MF on my first build. Nobody told me thay dji o3 uses 24khz frequency.... and I had to change my esc from 24 to 48khz.... 1 click of a button and 20 days of shit flights and pain gone.. You will figure it out@ dude. ask again. your thing just got lost in the thread otherwise I'll ping some folks. either way, I'd like to see what Sivis actually told you Ill try that in a few minutes. Just woke up from sleep Ah u woke up hangry!!"
if im in the EU i have to use LBT on my radio right? cause would FCC _technically_ be better or does it not really matter and i should just get LBT?,"CE_EU limits you to 100mW and enables LBT. LBT can be significantly detrimental to link quality.. I think that all of the 10 people who run lbt will confirm. Im having an issue with my OSD, I can seem to get link quality ro appear. Im using Elrs, with beta flight 4.4.2, My vtx is runc cam wasp, with dji goggles v2. Show a screenshot of bf receiver tab"
the limitation is not on the hardware right.. like the firmware limits it.. so i could technically just buy an LBT one and flash the fcc stuff on it?. and like switch between them or whatever,It is indeed just firmware. Keep in mind that Rx and Tx need to have the same region.
"ohh alright, so fcc and lbt cant communicate?","@Cerberus (Anzu Pride) hm, rssi setting are set correctly here. There go the simple ideas.. Correct. @Cerberus (Anzu Pride) send a screenshot of ports tab. And then OSD tab"
:slightly_smiling_face:. @Cerberus (Anzu Pride) is your DJI VTX wired up to rx1/tx1?,ill take that as a yes :) no sure on that it is a pre built
Did you mess with ports tab or configuration in any significant way?@c.e.r.b.e.r.u.s. And post a screenshot of osd tab,"@Cerberus (Anzu Pride) show the entire tab, at top scroll. Enable link quality in all of the profiles. In case you're switching them somehow And set video format to HD. Sand save. Optionally, put the link quality into the middle of the screen. Just as a sanity check"
"someone on reddit said this about fcc and lbt, is this bs or true?  "" From a pure power standpoint, fcc is allowed to contact other galaxys, while LBT is locked to not be noticed by your neighbors dog...  But from a technical standpoint, LBT is far better in performance, as long as every device is using it.  Fcc regulation is just ""send messages as you like it, if your neighbors shout, just shout louder so your receiver can hear you, doesn't matter that your neighbor tries the same"".  LBT (listen before talk) has a few extra implementations, that allow your system to ""know if your neighbor is shouting"" and if he does, you wait until he is done, before you shout your own message. For this reason LBT allows you a maximum percentage of time used, so that more people can communicate at the same time.  Under optimal conditions, LBT reduces the noise floor (since all devices wait before transmitting) and can give you up to 20% more range.  In real world terms, as soon as there are more devices then time slots, or somebody doesn't use LBT (like the majority of European fpv pilots, and nearly every other device) or your time slot is covered by a device you can't hear, because you started at the same time, etc.) you get more like 5% more range and no better noise floor.  This is hardly simplified and doesn't take channel shifting or any other technical improvement into consideration. ""  cause like.. if its true, using lbt would be better if its regulated in the EU, right?","ask on the ELRS discord then.. one issue is that you no longer control the precise packet timing. since you have to lbt... from most people's experience with LBT, running it seems worse, regardless of the system.. or so I've seen/tried... (I haven't tried ELRS LBT, especially since it was very buggy for a long time). (and because I'm not actively flying lol) huh.. alrighty, thanks ill give it a shot in the ELRS discord. thank you"
"So I think my barometer is not working or it's not got enough space in my 3.5"" cinewhoop to function properly.  Not much can be done about the space. It's very jammed packed.   I believe this is causing my RTH function to act like this.  I been told you can force BF to get altitude info from gps? Any one previously done this? Any issues with doing this?","If you are talking about the ""bobbing"" it's fine, that's how my quads went up for the rth, if the baro wasn't working (assuming it's enabled in the configuration tab and osd) it would be very obvious on the osd (like telling you you are -314m even if you are going up)"
Can someone please help answer my question?,"Well, that's how both my miniquads did rth and it was perfectly reliable ah fair enough. If thats normal then it is what it is.. I wonder why it throttle pumps though. appreciate the feed back though. Its my first cinewhoop if thats how it behaves it is what it is :slightly_smiling_face: it works :D.

"On my Taranis, I press-and-hold the PAGE button to switch to the telemetry screens. If you press-and-hold one of the UP or DOWN buttons, does it switch for you?","I’ll try that. The up button goes to a statistics page, but the down switched to telemetry. Tysm"
"Maybe, maybe not. What happened?",I tried getting it back together with duct tape but it’s very blurry now. And also I get green/ purple hues popping on and off Yea focal length is a tricky thing to get right. Probably best to replace it
is darwinfpv.com an american site or a european site?,"If it’s blurry, the camera can focus by turning (or most cameras do)… maybe not idk The duct tape will prevent me from doing that xD One of my cameras used to be very blurry after a crash, and I couldn’t fix it. Replaced the camera, then I realized a while ago that you can focus the cameras… I’ve put it aside, I have a new camera laying around It's a shit site, see, Darwinfpv has a special perk, as soon as you get your quad you can learn to troubleshoot (Basically, don't buy from Darwin) The lens and IR filter are useful spare parts to have. I've seen both be broken in crashes."
hey what does prop wash mean?,It's the dirty turbulent air coming from the prop. Usually means unpredictable behavior when you encounter it. Not anything crazy
"thanks. and if when im doing a dive and turn up really fast, and my drone like goes crazy. thats prop wash right?","Well, prop wash is also called prop wash oscillation, it's when the quad flies in its own turbulent air, it doesn't go crazy (to me crazy is if it for exemple gets out of control, which prop wash doesn't do), but it kind of oscillate in the air as it's trying to stabilize itself, and that's prop wash So what you are describing most likely is indeed prop wash"
"Hey guys is there any use for a broken walksnail cam?. No dmg, just camera doesn’t show an image anymore","you ask walksnail and see if they can replace it. :p Alr *me going to buy from Darwin just because all my previous drones are also shit, so I’m used to it*. (This is a joke) They did :slightly_smiling_face: I just don’t know what to do with the defective one keychain. or open it up see if there's anything interesting Imagine destroying a cinelog with ***the chair*** I like to just expose my broken crap on their own shelf and reflect back on how much money I wasted every time I pass Infront of it"
"how would i fix it?. board looks mint, like no obvious dmg or anything, it just doesnt show any video at all","By having a big brain, and looking for broken components, then finding out what is the broken component, then replacing it i wish it was tht easy to just find a broken component Idk what’s wrong with it… if it’s a lens, those are replaceable (I think), if it’s a tiny IC, maybe that can be fixed… if you knew what was wrong you could try to fix it. Best case, you get a second working cam for free, worst case it stays broken The component might be on the front side, you can open it up and send (with a clean focus) images of both sides here or on the walksnail discord and someone might be able to help you"
Are there any screws on the back side ?,"negative. Back side ofcourse Well then its both glued on and held by screws (when they are installed, you can see the threadings), you could try to gently pry it off while applying heat on it, with a heat gun or hair drier for exemple, to soften the glue, you want to be careful to not bend the casing (and if you use a heatgun, be careful to not burn yourself or over do it and have a component sliding)"
If I let a Lipo get too low and cell voltage goes to 3.2-3.4 with 2% battery life. Is it okay to charge and use normally? Or did I mess up by letting it get so low?. I read somewhere I shouldn’t go lower than 3.6? Or maybe i misunderstood,"Charge it up ASAP. You don't really want it below 3.5v in reality Thank you just wanted confirmation it was safe to do so, I have no problem disposing of a battery for safety reasons If you want to be safe, you need to be writing down the IR of your cells every so often"

How’s this? :smiling_face:,"looks neat, I'd just desaturate the golden-ish grass ye 100%. Currently watching a tutorial on the colour page to se how I can highlight that section :face_with_tongue: or target that specific color you can adjust the hue vs saturation curve. that's how I'd do it anyway Thanks again!! :slightly_smiling_face: think I just found that. Only my 2nd ever attempt at editing or anything like this. Actually a really fun part of the hobby. 2nd one from the bottom looks .. interesting, lol. also the joints arent really in focus. lol no other way to say this... terrible My second time ever soldering, I legit do not know why I got myself into this :loudly_crying_face:"
are you soldering with a candle?,"i think you werent using enough heat tbh. and make sure to heat the pad too no but for real... take a step back and practice proper soldering using proper equipment, this is a recipe for fire"
"I think I need a bit more practise, don’t you? :thinking_face:","if not, you shuld add some We don’t have any, I did look but it wouldn’t arrive in time and I’m going out of town tmr. that sucks, i wouldnt fly the drone with the joints you have rn tho My friend is helping me fix them, this was before and they’re looking a bit better now, this was just to try and see how diabolical you all thought they are Bro dont be afraid to crank that heat up, 360/380 for those pads. You got to use some flux as well. It’s already at 400 :). This is what hers look like, so I’m working towards this ye thats good standard. I wouldn't call that good either better then the previous didnt even see that lol. Bro follow these steps you cant go wrong. 1) clean all the pads up and start over.  2) Add flux to the pads before solder and hold your iron onto the pad for a few seconds. Then put solder onto the pad, the pad should be hot enough to melt the solder. Keep feeding solder until you have a nice ball. 3) Make sure your motor wires are tinned. Then add more flux to the balls of solder on the esc pads. 4) now hold your motor wire over one of the pads and push down from the top. The solder on the motor wire will melt and heat will transfer to motor pad and melt that as well making 1 clean joint.   If you do the above should look like this. Turns out wire insulation strimmy thingies were buggered, fixed with electrical tape. you couldve done the entire wire, or used some heatshrink :/"
Looks like it got sliced on the carbon. Can you mix 21700s and 18650s? Like 2 packs in parallel,I really really wouldn't
"I mean yea, but would it work?","Even if they have the same mAh rating and C rating, they'll have different IRs and other different characteristics that make them a very poor choice to mix in a parallel pack, or across packs in parallel. Electrically it'd work fine, like, they aren't going to burn up just because they're plugged in together, but the discharge curve is different on each cell, and you want them to be as close as possible to each other if you actually want to be able to use them without them dying"
I think I'll stick to one or the other. Even in terms of space the size difference isn't very big but just a funny idea I had. What's a good brand for 18350s? I think I can cram like 6 of those in my airframe instead of 2 18650s. Doesn't seem like molicel or Samsung make any 18350s,"ZOHD drift. I have some at home I'll see if they can fit width in there, I could trim the foam too. My 2s 18650 fits but it has to be diagonal so if it fits it'll be very tight, which would be nice since the 18650s don't sit very well"
"Should a ShortSaver prevent the drone from spinning up too fast? (also all at once to a lower rpm)?. the former and latter happens at 1A, while the latter (and not the first) at 2A","why are you using a shortsaver while spinning your motors dont. if everything powers on fine the shortsaver isnt needed anymore. the 1A/2A means as soon as it pulls more than the selected value itll cut power Short saver is ONLY for bench testing, it should not be used while flying."
Could I run into interference issues running say 16 motors worth of phase wires next to each other?,"I've not heard of that happening, but it seems possible to me. It would depend on how much power and how close they are to each other."
The wires zip tied in a bundle and very low power. Like probably under 5a per motor. Could the motors interfere with each other if they are in close proximity?,"At that low power, I would say no, you shouldn't have an issue"
"hi, what exactly does this mean on my OSD? that its transmitting at 25mW on channel 1 or sth like that?","This means that Betaflight is telling the VTX to transmit on Band R (raceband), Channel 1, 25mW"
is 25mW very low? should i put that higher?,"*Quick warning: Just because Betaflight is trying to tell that to a VTX, doesn't necessarily mean the VTX is listening*. but beside that. yes 25mW is not a lot. in fact it's very little the other option i have is 200 200 it is then. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: i really hope the MSP thing catches on and more VTX manufacturers start using it. or at least supporting it"
will the vtx heat up quicker when transmitting at 200mW vs 25?. like i think it would but like.. much quicker?,of course. that's a lotta extra power
but i get a temperature warning anyway right?,"not for the VTX, again: the protocol it's using can't really communicate back to the FC. it'd just shut down that doesnt sound fun well yeah but it wouldn't really happen unless you're not flying. digital stuff has warnings. openvtx might i have HDZero...so hopefully it does ill test fly it and then see how hot it gets. thank youu :) if it gets too hot you're not flying hard enough :p seems like an oversight to not include temperature in MSP protocol"
wait couldnt i use a switch to change power on the vtx?. since its on Betaflight. that would be useful,"yeah but you. really don't need to for what you're doing i meann yeah, but then i could have the 25mW when im flying close and i can be sure that the VTX is nice and cool and when i NEED it i can swtich to 200mW. btw, idk what the UAVTech preset changed, but ever since ive applied it my motors are literally cold after flying (maybe it wasnt that and i just changed sth else but yeah) shitty tunes and all that will and can heat your motors up"
What player are you trying to use?,"all of them ;s. on mac os oh i think i can change the output power in the goggles in the menu, i just gotta figure out how to navigate that, lol"
"should i clean my skyo4x goggles from inside? the image quality is not like when i first go it, not sure if dirt can go inside the goggles, probably because I don't keep it in it's bag :PepeFeelsBadman:","i mean.. idk how it is with goggles.. but dust or mold/condensation can form on camera lenses.. soo i would assume the same applies for those it was just out of focus, it's crazy the every time I wear the goggles I have to lock the focus again ohh alright :) still better than mold, lol i just did and it is not workoing .... also auto recording on take off does not work"
"Hello I was wondering why pick a quad copter over a tri copter. I'm looking into why a tri is less stable, and I get that having a moving motor cause stability issues. But could it also be because there is less research on tri copters?",a trictopter requires a servo to have yaw control. a servo really hinders the agility and durability. that's the biggest part of why they're not used much
If there was a motor like a stepper motor that was small enough and quick enough would it improve this?,steppers are harder to drive. it requires extra hardware and software most of the time
Or maybe a prop on the side along the other axis?,at that point it's a quadcopter. so why not lay it out flat You make a good point :see-no-evil_monkey: You could do a Y-6. Stack the props so you can have that control
"Actually you should be able to do it without a servo, right? The software required would be slightly expensive though  And the control would be messy","Nope. You have 3 props and only 2 directions they can turn It wouldn't work at all. In order to balance yaw control, the angular momentum needs to be neutral. With 2 props spinning one way and 1 spinning the other, you can either have balanced angular momentum, or balanced thrust, but never both."
Hmm tru you cant have a pure yaw  But you can have some sort of alternating way to get from one orientation to another. Actually what if you change the angle of mounting of the motors?,"Let's say you tilted the tail motor so it cancels the yaw that would be produced by the props,  let's now say you wanted to yaw, then (imagine motor 1 is the tail motor, motor 2 is the front right motor, motor 3 is the front left, motor 1 and 2 spin in the same direction) you would then spin up motor 1 and 2 (or motor 3) and you will end up with the quad oscillating since the thrust is not balanced anymore. Tricopters are just crappy, the only Y configuration that is worth looking at is the Y6 (a tricopter with 6 motor in a coaxial configuration) since it doesn't have this yaw issue"
hey guys wrecked my nazgul 5 and one of the props just spins on the shaft now.. like the nut cant tighten it down . is it ok to put some like washers in there or whats the usual solution for that?,Just replace it. If it melted on the shaft and now doesn't tighten anymore you can't really fix it Yepp a weird and horrible way to achieve the change we want. But my theory was that given 3 force vectors I should be able to generate any resultant vector in a 3d space  (with a weird control though)
you talking about a 3 propped drone?,"I mean, having just 3 force vector would only include the thrust (one vector per propeller), so you would forget the yaw moment, which is the real issue here. Yes, he tries to make tricopters work, but the issue here is that he just fills in the issues of a servo-less tricopter with *a weird control* Well I first thought if I were to angle all 3 motors at any certain angle in the same direction, then we would effectively get yaw. But I see the flaw, its not a simple force vector, need to account for the motors' angular momentum"
im sure it could somehow work but . you would be doign some major r&d. has it ever been done?,"Tri copters were a big thing back when quad copters kinda sucked (when active backing wasn't a thing yet so quads had even worse yaw control than a tricopter, which is why tricopters were used back then), so most things were tried, and if anything would have worked better for our purpose (snappy control and stable flight) it would have been used, cause the servo solution was really not a very good one and even then everyone was aware that the servo solution was shitty (iirc you actually had one guy who dedicated his time to trying to make the tricopter work better, I don't recall his name tho, and he stopped the second quads became good) i mean the osprey does it with 2.... and certain helicopters well they're helicopters i guess thos have pitch control props Which aren't practical in our case"
https://youtu.be/X-z_zlXy0o0?si=seVUwV8eruPSxasz  https://www.swallenhardware.io/battlebots/2019/10/16/hit-n-spin,"My drone won’t arm everything is fine on beta flight the transmitter connects fine and the buttons are set up correctly. I can turn my beeper on and off but I can’t arm it. It has a wing. There is a guy who made the ceiling fan that uses 3 props and is more efficient than a quad. But it has wings so therefore another way to control it It’s unactuated, it’s not a control surface. Also that 3 prop thing would work with 1 prop, there would just be more control lag Yes it can be done but from what I'm understanding you seemed to be referring to more of just one big prop and no other controls"
"Because you have to wait 360 for the prop to spin into position instead of at max 120. Yes, all of these have just 1 moving part. No other controls. You could also do it with one of those lead-lag rotor heads, let me find the vid. One of these, but just some big draggy plates instead of a tail rotor https://youtu.be/d80oXSCcHTk?si=CvWBr26QDPfxVQXq. Again, just one actuator","That's what I was thinking when you were mentioning single prop, I completely forgot about the spinny guy Basically, all of these take advantage of the fact that *you don’t actually need yaw control* I mean yea but you sacrifice a lot of things just to run on one prop Of course. For one, they’re entirely uncontrollable by a human, you need a flight controller I like the idea of a person struggling to control that. Although if you increase the size and minimize the weight you could get a fairly slow rotation which may allow for a skilled pilot to fly it"
"Hey guys is darwin129 7 long range pnp worth the buy? I mostly need a drone for the distance, so I could deliver small things to my friend who is like 1km away from me",is dynamic tx power reliable or should i just set it to 1000w all the time dynamic tx is reliable. and generous so also great for freestyle
i dont need t o set anything besides turning it on right?. i just set fan at 250mw and max power to 1000mw,"Alot of the 7"" BNF are pretty decent MOZ7 - IFLIGHT CHIMERA 7"" these are 2 other good ones. assuming latest ELRS, yes, it is reliable That's the setting I use no issues."
i updated to latest around 2 months ago. is there a new firmware out ?,should be good enough. Unless you use LBT in which you really should update @NikkoYatt
whats lbt?. my controller is fcc mode,then it's fine. 3.4.3 fixes an issue which can cause some receivers settings to get corrupted f regulations. i even contacted the military tower in my country and they dont really care haha. i guess ill update it to the newest firmware. it doesnt have any disadvantages for me
I’m new to drones and stuff so I have no idea what’s good and what isn’t :grinning_face_with_sweat: you think it can carry like 0.5 grams and stuff?,do you want an FPV drone or a camera drone
"Well is a difference big? I just need a drone for transport, 3km would be cool, so I can just turn it on from home, send it to my friend and then fly it back. And it’s nothing big, usually 2-3 grams of stuff at most (toys). at*",Take those names and stick them into youtube. You should be able to find a fair amount of reviews on each of those drones.
I saw the one that i mentioned (Darwin 129 7” Long Range PNP) so is he good for those kind of stuff?. My friend is like 1km away from me,Range/penetration comes down to what's inside the drone. No idea what parts the Darwin uses. However it will come down to receiver/vtx (the video system being used).. Also alot of drones struggle with obstacles in your way whilst on route. If your 1-3km if the drone goes behind a obstacle you will struggle and most likely loose signal.
Can’t I fly it a bit higher and avoid those obstacles?,Well yes ofc you can. It was just a example. Need to make sure you got clear LOS
what is the difference between gemfan 1219 and 1219s propellers?,"blud wants to transport some white powder stuff or sum:face_with_tears_of_joy: The reason I chose Darwin was because he was cheapest that can cover 3km. So can’t I just fly high and avoid all of that!. I’m in a wheelchair, going by foot would take significant amount of time, and the toys are made out of paper i think 150g stuff would also be okay cmon you must realise what you implied. and why that makes us very unlikely to lend a hand weight, pitch, max propeller width etc. you can also see that the 1219 are more angular It’s not even that much, my biggest concern is can it fly 1km to my friend. I probably should have worded it better, now I see that it looks like I would be carrying some illegal substances lmao :face_with_tears_of_joy: It isn’t, so I’d like to stay on the topic if it’s possible"
@The GGManiack if i update the internal module for elrs i should choose this right?. or non of the options there,"idk what region you're running rn i want the best performance. i dont care about regulations since military also didnt care when i called them Well. there are two schools of thought ISM - shout over everyone as loudly as possible cause f* em but aint no way i am flying with like 10mw or idk CE_EU (LBT) - wait for others to shut up and then shout my shit, hoping that they also follow the shut up rule ill use ISM because the other one limits to 100mw fair enough. *I'm really considering making custom builds that run EU frequencies, LBT, but unlocked power*. *ahem* I mean i also asked a military tower and they say its okay. i mean i also always call them before i fly well the military tower doesn't give a shit. when you get into an incident and get investigated, that's when you'll find someone who does fair enough. However, I now always make sure to ask for permission before flying. Because of my one of my recent flights, I had a thought that was kinda lika ahh f it and just fly without permission. But before I took off, three military helicopters flew 150 meters above me. lucky me that I didnt start 1 minute before that haha What size sleeves should I get for my wires I'm not talking about flying.... flying is not the context we're talking about. we're talking about RF legality I know but flying also has something do to with RF and I had my TX power at 1000mw at that time. They would have noticed it. Ah shit my elrs receiver just got magic smoke because I forgot to unplug. haha. welp time to buy a new one. depends on what you intend to use the wire for I use 8mm mesh wire. https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/8mm-snakeskin-mesh-wire-1m-6843.html. and on both ends heat shrink heat shrink tubes. just like Vitroid does in his builds"
Why. Can you send a picture?,"rn my quad is disassembled and cooked but i can look for a pic of vitroid. @:classical_building: thats some of his builds Coloured zip ties :face_with_open_eyes_and_hand_over_mouth: bruh i think my quad is about. to go boom I'm gonna take another photoshoot, I don't like the ugly early spring photos. just need to wait for a nice overcast day, shooting in direct sunlight isn't ideal bruh why tf does my quad smoke when i put in usb c. im cooked. i mean it somehow still works lol"
Do you use 8mm braided sleeves?,"kinda the same ones that i posted as a link Your quad is in smoke :saluting_face: I use 6mm ones, but 8mm works too"
Oops. Was I meant to fit this?. I guess it goes under the headsync,No you are not. I believe they replace the bottom plate with the heatsink.
"Ok thanks, but then why do they include it in the box at all?",In case you want to remove the air unit out. The heat sink might not fit another frame.e.. So you can reassemble the dji o3 and put it in another frame. Thankfully the dji o3 is literally plug one cable Into any fc and it's good to go.
can i spray paint my carbon fiber frame?,"Yes. Scuff the surface with high grit sand paper or steel wool, then paint at will. Emilia and Lorin have both done it, they can probably answer more questions about details I did it as well (did sensibly the same as what Daedalus said but added a clear coat at the end) and the paint gets pretty easily scratched off in my experience, just something to know"
I'm completely new to drones but I want to build one. From what I understand the controller sends signals to the transmitter/radio. That then goes to the flight control which then sends signals to the ESC and that speeds the motors?. Is this correct?. and are there any other parts beside a camera,"Controller/transmitter sends to the receiver on the drone, receiver talks to FC, FC runs pid loop and talks to the ESC every single time im typing a long response Video transmitter, camera, motors and beeper are other common things. you should do it either way other people often put waaay more effort in and can write better than me"
Do I need things like GPS or sensor or can I go without them?,"GPS is for autonomous capability and knowing position and such. when you're freestyling or similar, you're not going far away enough to warrant anything but a beeper"
Whats a beeper used for?,"find your drone in tall grass when crashes I recently upgraded the EdgeTX firmware on my Radiomaster TX12 Mk2 from 2.8.0 to 2.10.3, and the ELRS firmware from 3.3.0 to 3.4.3. I also updated the ELRS firmware on my receiver (GEPRC 2.4 GHz Nano) from 3.3.0 to 3.4.3.  Since the upgrade, I've lost all GPS telemetry parameters. I'm no longer seeing GPS speed, heading, coordinates, or satellite information in the telemetry. I tried deleting all telemetry parameters and rescanning, but it didn't help.  I took the quad to an open area, ensured it got a solid 3D fix with a good PDOP value (around 1.2), deleted all telemetry parameters again, and rescanned—but still no GPS telemetry.  In Betaflight, the GPS satellites, 3D fix, and PDOP values are all showing up correctly. The quad is set to arm only when it locks onto 8 satellites, and it's functioning as expected in that regard.  I'm using a packet rate of D250 (-104dB) and a telemetry ratio of 1:16. The flight controller is a Speedybee F405 V4, flashed with Betaflight 4.5.  Before the EdgeTX and ELRS upgrades, the GPS telemetry was working fine. I'm not sure which upgrade caused the issue.  I can still see the GPS parameters in the OSD without any problems.  Any help to resolve this would be greatly appreciated."
"was flying my drone earlier,  it was in angle mode, but i couldnt seem to be able to change to acro by moving aux 2, how do i get it into acro? attached are my modes in betaflight",you've made it permanently angle... oh its just like that by default You have set up Angle mode so that it is always active. Make it not like that. Adjust the sliders to set the range to correspond to what switch position you want Angle mode to be active in.
"aux 2 for me is a 3 way switch, how do i know which is forward and backward?. middle i would assume is just dead center?","If you turn your radio on while you have your quad plugged into Betaflight, you should be able to move the switch on the radio, and watch the little tick mark on the screen move back and forth. radio is on drone is plugged in but im not seeing it move Check to make sure you are seeing stick movement in the Receiver tab"
"Well that's a problem. You were flying earlier, so clearly it's bound and working. Are you using ELRS?","Try unplugging the quadcopter, make sure it has no power. Then, plug it back in, and see if you get stick movement in the Receiver tab. If you don't have the radio turned on when you have the receiver powered, eventually the receiver goes into wifi mode You can tell if the light of the receiver begins to flash very quickly Looks better. So now, when the switch is all the way up, it should be in Angle mode. The middle should be Horizon mode. And the lowest position will be acro mode"
"what modes are those?  Assume top one is arm, what is the 2nd and 3rd one?","okok. all is fine then (except for the fact that Horizon exists *but that's my personal opinion*) i was flying in angle before, which was smooth but i wanted to try acro Acro should be your ultimate goal. Always i dont knwo if i might need it so ill just keep it"
How long have you flown around in Angle for? @wolfy,today was like my second proper flight
Have you trained for Acro?,"i realised it was angle when i went for a roll and couldnt roll was just worried this was going to be yet another ""I tried to rawdog acro after getting used to angle and flew my drone into a wall at full speed"" my first flight i almost lost my drone cus i wasnt used to the throttle"
how  i can to change  watt in dji goggles?,"Guys is that normal weight for hdzero 1s whoop on fractal frame. I feel like I could clean it up a bit and maybe shave a gram. But that's about it oof that battery and connector Just what I started with, those packs been at 2.3v way too many times. New ones will be with bt. I keep hearing about voltage sag from pH connector everywhere and find it hard to believe it alone can make whoop fly much worse compared to bt plugs oh it does. it's pretty extreme. like just visually comparing them alone will show you. > At the moment, the best 1S batteries are folded-cell LIHV packs made by Grepow, which are sold under their Tattu brand, and also rebranded and sold by WebleedFPV, Newbeedrone, tinywhoop, Dogcom, and BetaFPV under their ""LAVA"" brand."
Why isnt angle activating?. Works for horizon,"Like its not turning yellow when it hits the range. But if thats ok. Also AUX 1 is a slider for me and is acting like a switch After slapping hdzero on my whoop I had to change motors as well sadly as I killed one of 25000kv ones I had by accident.  Used some spare 20000kv ones I had from mob7 kicking around, they do lack top end and I easy feel like more than 20% juice is gone compared to old setup. Guess I'll give bt a go before I order new motors"
Oh really?. Why and how can I fix it,"ARM must be on AUX1 (CH5) and ARMed when at 2000 (disarmed at 1000). this is an ELRS requirement. Because your arming switch isn't arming just the drone, it's also arming the ELRS transmitter module. enabling dynamic power, disabling ability to change some of the settings, and changing how some other stuff is handled If you want your ARM switch to be inverted, you can invert it in Mixes on the radio. usually by changing the weight from 100 to -100 Can I somehow invert the channel because I want it to arm when I push the switch away from me expected the question :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: yes yes. I wasnt looking at thge screen lol. Things that happen if u cant touchtype"

Wait longer for sure, but if it's still no good after like 20-30 minutes try the official EdgeTX guide and flash through the USB port.",Downloaded latest edgeTX firmware. Booted my radio into bootloader mode. Selected the file and it had a green check mark. Held down enter to write firmware and it’s been stuck here for 5 minutes.. Any ideas the edgebuddy thing doesnt work. no matter what i try -.- that's probably a driver issue yeah... about that. tried so many drivers and looking up my error that i just thought the fool proof way was loading it to my sd card
Do you guys use loctite on your posts?,yes. and you should. I lose all my damn screws whenever I don't lol I’m glad to hear it’s not just me. I let my buddy fly my quad and I watched a screw fall off of it and I was like :woman_standing::woman_standing: i lost like. 5 screws before I noticed Dude same!. When he landed there was only 1 screw holding the top plate :face_with_tears_of_joy: The older the picture the more mismatched shitty dollar store screws Fortunately I haven’t lost any screws out of the 3 quads I’ve had while flying.. Lost many when upgrading and replacing parts tho
then check if tx and rx are wired correctly. GPX TX must go to FC RX and vice versa. Is the LED on the GPS module lighting up?,Hey I have installed my new gps module flywoo goku mini v3 and there is no yellow icon in betaflight and I do not get any gps signal. Pls help me check if gps is enabled in the configuration page and if your gps is set up correctly in the ports tab No. Yes it’s blinking green
Its at zero throttle? No?,"it's lower than 0 (1000). https://oscarliang.com/channel-map/ I turned on transmitter, it bound, then instantly started to go spinning very fast at the bottom (don't worry, props are off) dont worry, it's because the props are off :face_with_tears_of_joy: Yes it makes sense. Arming makes it spin if you're sure that the motor direction, motor order and prop order and directions are correct, put some props and and it'll calm down. arming spin up is because the motors arent getting any load (drag from props) Make sure props and motors are on right!!!! Hmm, now I can see it going up and down when throttling, but the motors aren't spinning, even though I just did a test in betaflight to make sure they were working."
Which one should i choose?,https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146/1144570522991067146
soldering pad on FC or GPS?,"Well, you could use the jst plug for it, if it doesnt have one, i'd buy a new one. It doesn't have a plug :face_with_diagonal_mouth:"
Is that a capacitor on those leads?,yeah they're saying it's the only option. even though there's plenty better ones It'll provide little to no benefit at that length. Might as well not even have one.. Solder the main battery leads at an angle and stick the cap vertically right between them can also put them to the sides
"I have formatted my SD card before, do I need to do it again when updateing firmware ?","Certainly did.. 3 mins after that I got it working thanks to the advice, 3 after that I got it into my tree, dropped out, landed, no damages :) Need someone to make a stl file for me to hold it on the rear stand off by the o3 ai unit.

I'll try again https://walksnail.app/. make sure you pick the right file ok, thank you. I went to that web-site  Emilia (XT90 Janklet)                       says its corrumped. when I git the goggles 1V download, it came back with a file corrupt"
I change it too. Do you think that its a good placement for the buzzer? Im afraid that I’m squeezing the buzzer too much with the zip tie and there is a pressure on the battery of the buzzer.,"looks fine to me, but you want to be able to reach the button on that thing hey it's me again, when i arm my new quad it goes off full throttle into the sky, i did check twice: motor direction, reorder motors, prop direction - it all checks out. this happens as soon as i arm the drone not when i add throttle, the FC is softmounted and i don't believe there would be such horrible vibrations causing this. I also have the blackbox files: (3 arms, on all of them it happened)"
proper gyro alignment?,"solved, and this is why I have trust issues"
what happened. lol. gyro misaligned?,"props/motor direction were in fact not checking out at least they let you check for yourself. sometimes people are just ""trust me, I'm not showing you"" Or in other words ""lazy"""

I tried reading these programs, but nothing is working when you plug the drone in the computer it says file not found Because u maybe dont provide any information https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshuaBardwell I have watched 25 videos on how to do this it's not working josh has a bunch of video explaining the binf I watched all his videos Tell us whats the issue. Exactly. Provide as much information and pictures as possible OK, the first thing I'm supposed to do is turn my radio on and bring it down to mind then plug the battery in three times so the green light goes on so they could bind well that doesn't happen when I do that There is never too much information. Ok lets slow down and go step by step"
"1. did u update the firmware of the radio? If no, do that 2. did u update the elrs module of the boxer radio? If no, do that 3. if u plug in the battery into the drone, wait ~30sec, is the receiver flashing?",Can you make it so we can talk to each other all right the firmware my radio is 331.

uh both? currently I have props in because thats what it was by default. and I've heard there are many more advantages with props in. more advantages with props out i mean,"OK, I'm here. I don't know what you mean by start with one and two. Ok so 2 things u need to change  1 - invert the direction via betaflight configurator —> Motor tab (its a toggle switch at the top of the page)  2 - remove props, plug in a battery and use the direction wizard in the configurator to make sure they spin the way they should.

What u showed us is ELRS. But what I wrote with 1 is the firmware of the radio itself Someone just wrote I need to stop spamming all the channels. I'm not spamming anything asking for help. Basically the operating system. Yea thats true. Dont crosspost. Stay in one channel and wait till u get help I don't even know what that means Google will tell u.  But lets stay on topic"
Do you have someone new year and they're already yelling at you?. Her,Crossposting is something no server likes The firmware on this radio would be 3.3.1 right
How do I look that up?,I already told u thats the version of the ELRS module. Two separate things Ok now I know what you're saying ExpressLRS EdgeTX - operating system of the radio Edgetx is like windows. Expresslrs can be compared to a driver version or software. I would simply update to the latest.. Power off the radio
How do I do that? I. Radio is off,"Plug in the USB cable in the top port, which u know for a fact can transmit data, open the webpage i linked earlier for 1. and press „connect“. If that doesnt work u can also use bootloader mode   https://manual.edgetx.org/edgetx-how-to/access-dfu-and-bootloader-mode Radiomaster ^"
Do I have to download anything in my computer before I plug it in?. I have the right wire,"https://manual.edgetx.org/installing-and-updating-edgetx/update-from-opentx-to-edgetx-1. Maybe the STM driver but lets see. Do what i said and see what u get as devices OK, so I'm gonna turn my radio off plugged into the computer"
Are u asking or telling me?,"Yes, I'm asking you just to make sure I heard a noise, but nothing popped up"
Did u click on the link in posted regarding updating? This https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1271541541508354161. For firmware version select the latest,I have to bring you up discord on the computer so I'm talking to you on my phone so I can click on the link I'm restarting computer Not sure what u are trying to show me Just a picture of ears. Elrs
Ok? Still dont know :Harold:,"I restart a computer and now my computer is thinking. lol im on my desktop pc now, lets see how far get via chat. if u are struggling we can do it via voice. i hope u are not Scottish, because i cant understand that at all :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I live in New Jersey. ok imhere. i think we should open chat. please"

ok did u do what the manual/guide told u?. regarding the version u pick the latest,"No, I didn't do that yet. I don't know how to do it. It's not connecting. u do need to follow the steps of the guide. step by step, carefully"
"Sorry to ask this question in here its really off topic :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: but I know we have some people with experience in editing up in this joint.

I am currently on a full davinci resolve course!, but this hasn't been covered.  I am trying to achieve the following shot, but not sure what the best way to edit or film the desired clip.  For example, I have a fully loaded FPV backpack on the floor. Quads tied to the outside and the inside is full. I want the bag to unpack without seeing me do it?. Basically every few seconds 1 item has come off the bag and is on the floor all the way to the internals of the bag. In my head, I am thinking the best way to do this would be with a timelapse shot right?. Set it to 10 seconds or something and jump in between the shots and remove 1 item. Is that the best way to do it?",u click what the guide tells u to I don't know what you mean. I selected the firmware I picked my radio. But now I got a flash sheet or download it I don't know which one to do the guide has every step written out. u do need to read it.. and so on..... step by step
Just want to ask if this scenario would work : i have 2 drones 1 with elrs and other one with frsky (compatible with 4in1) and i have boxer that runs on elrs and i also have a 4in 1 module i heard you can save like a profile of binded reciver so i am asking this if i bind both would it work i mean one with normal elrs and other one with additional 4 in 1 module and if these 2 profiles are easy to access?. I am not sure if you can understand it because its harder to explain...,"No, I've been reading the instructions. I did what it said, but it doesn't say what firmware version to Pic. There's all different types here. i told u the version to pick. twice now"
Bootloader: Turn off the radio transmitter. Pull both horizontal trim switches together and press the power button. DFU: Turn off the radio transmitter. Plug in the USB cable to the USB port on the top of the radio.. So we're doing the boot loader one right is that what I have to do?. Or DFU. That's what it says for my radio,"again, u just need to read the guide. its all in the ""update from earlier version ..."" And then you want me to do the two things in the red boxes, but I don't have a jumper. I have a radio master. yes correct, u go step by step through the guide :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: This is where I'm confused. I don't have a jumper. I have a radio master."
did u click on the radio model box yet?. the screenshot is just an example,"Right, I put in radio master"
which different versions?,"There's flying Dutchman its a version code name the numbers matter. u do see them increasing. and i told u pick the latest. i.e. the top one is the latest 10.3 would be the highest one for edge TX Version 2.10.x = Centurion Version 2.9.x = Providence Version 2.8.x = flying Dutchman etc.. its just codenames of the versions You see the one I have in the box now that would be the right one, right yes obviously :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I'm going to hit flash i told u pick the latest version, so the one with the highest number and u dont have a jumper, so u have to pick the model u have. now u go to the next step of the guide. read it. follow it"
"where is nothing to choose from?. did u read the ""if....."" of the guide/next step","The bound receiver is saved as part of a Model configuration in the radio. So you'll need to set up a new model for each of the different drones If I build a drone with everything basic does the controller for it come “pre mapped” with controls or not and if so how do I choose controls What do I do next because I can't add new device there's nothing there I did it doesn't tell you what to do here If it has something under available devices, then yes, but it has zero under available devices. Look at the picture RadioMaster ELRS ones do come with a default profile set up with every switch assigned to a channel already. Jumper ones don't. all you have to do is go to the mixes tab of the model and set set them up though, it's quite easy. channel 5 should always be your arm switch Boot looters not there to choose from in instructions. It says you need to do something else. I have two things I can choose from but they don't tell you what it is. Just give you numbers."
"did u find ""STM32 BOOTLOADER"" in the popup?","Yes, when I do that look what pops up the two items you can choose. I don't know what they even mean.. No, STM 32 boat loader is not present ok so do the ""note: if the stm32 bootloader...."" It's something to do with my drives right. I could share my screen with you if we did it in the chat do what the ""note"" thing says, if it still doesnt work we can screenshare Ok. I'm gonna do the impulse thing now downloading and installing https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html#get-software might also work. i have that installed due to other projects"
Internal elrs external 4in1. Question is can i save elrs and frsky both?,"Yes, you can save each one in its own Model and have them both work without changing anything"
What if i select the frsky one and i dont have module? On,"Well that would be a problem, wouldn't it. You need tires to drive your car. You need the module to be in the radio for it to connect to the drone that needs that module"
Okey well this is nice to know :). I just need to learn how to pair or idk how to turn on the 4in1 reciver and also i nedd to save the reciver. Its in section profiles??,"Think my whoop packs are dying. Plugging them in and its 4v instantly in osd from 4.35. Or is that normal with all the draw from vtx and radio windows + shift + S to screenshot btw low rf power, what the heck, what the heck"
"did u run the program as administrator?. if no, try that. if it still gives the error, restart your pc and try again","inside my walksnail goggles after updating the firmware if that also doesnt help, install the STM32 driver https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html#get-software I think he was ensuring the radio wouldn't have a meltdown trying to use a nonexistent module.  You and I know that this isn't like not having an antenna on a Tx, however... Let's go!!!. It says your radio has been flashed you now want to set up your SD card"
Trim switches are only good for fixed wings? Or are they used for something else also?,"i use them for my land vehicles aswell. maybe boats, but i dont got one"
If i will be more specific trim switches on Mt12. I mean they seem completly useless. For what actions do you use them?,"Mainly adjusting throttle centre or steering centre. When I first boot the esc, sometimes the motors are spinning slowly while the throttle is centred"
Hmmm Interesting. You use all 4 or only 2?. Wait joshua had something about this. Oh yes thanks for help :)),"For a drone however they are basically useless No, it says click SD card, which I did plug-in drone while connected and Pic storage which I did then your USB should prompt and it's not doing that I use them on my wings occasionally"
It's working. OK now I'm all done with that. What do I do next?. Radio is now unplugged what is our next step?,The mentioned step 2.. Bringing the radio ELRS to the latest version
"OK, so how do we do that?","We updated windows. Now we update a software basically We updated the software in my remote is what we just did I wrote that already earlier :winking_face:. The operating system, yes. Download the ELRS configurator. Install it Open it"
What do I get that from?,"I posted the link earlier as i just said. Or u can google for it Once opened, select again the latest firmware version, select your radio and click „build“. That should build the firmware and open it afterwards via the file explorer automatically. If thats done, power up the radio, go to the elrs LUA script, as u did earlier where u showed version 3.3. or whatever it was, and select the wifi option so the module goes into wifi mode. If its in wifi mode u will be able to lookup nearby wifi via your laptop and connect to one called „expresslrs“ The password will be expresslrs. After connecting either the website will open on its own or you can open a browser and type in the URL line http://10.0.0.1/ First, I gotta download it onto my thing I tried doing that express LRS as the password earlier and it says file not found or something. The first thing I need to do is download this on my computer. I tried doing it earlier, but I couldn't get to work. We're gonna do it now though. There will be an option to update the firmware. U will need to click the browse file button and navigate to the firmware file the configurator created earlier and upload it. Then click update and wait I'm trying to find where you wrote earlier where the download is I don't know where it's at Just google for it. Not that hard to find it Look where I have the mouse pointed at is that the right one I think it is OK, it's downloading now. Look. What is that"
see the isn't commonly downloaded warning below?. click it and accept it. this kind of pisses me off since chrome does the same shit,"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ it's just that it's synced with your google crap so you've never had to see it more than once Do you want my email address and then I'll be able to download this configure through the email just press trust on the warning I just got the vifly whoopstor 3 and some betafpv 1s lava 450mah batteries, what voltage should I charge them too and what current should I use.

"OK, I don't understand. It won't open express or ask configuration under my downloads it sits there. I hit open it just spins you have to run it under administration maybe. It's installing now good God this fucking computer. I don't understand why windows does this this should've been done installed an hour ago.. OK now what do I do?",Watch a YouTube or look at the ELRS docs Dude i told u every step. I hope u are kidding
I don't know what to do right now to this part. I have no idea I've been doing it step-by-step like you said I'm new to this so right now I got ELS configuration up there. I need to do I Pic 2.4 GHz or 900 Hz.. I don't even know what we're doing with the express LR configuration. What are we doing to this? I never did this.,2.4. Maaaaan this is going beyond insane. I told u now mulitple times what we are doing on a level to understand it.  Edgetx = operating software of the radio Expresslrs = basically a programm/driver running on your radio.   Both need to be updated. And what to do with and in the configurator i also told u. Each step from downloading to flashing
signal probably. the caddx vista coaxial cable should work with the pro kit right?,Significant. :Harold:
What would I check in settings?. Im using open tx,"Jumper T pro issue. Im having a issue with my radio with the right stick moving horizontally. the stick moves fine, but the out put is sluggish it move super slow. So for exsample if you give full stick it takes a second to output it on the software. check the settings maybe profiles, rates, calibration. not sure :PepeShrug:"
Is that a problem that the buzzer’s wires are going between the stack?,no. update to edgetx. most people won't be able to help you here when you're using like. 4 year old software. lol. <https://manual.edgetx.org/installing-and-updating-edgetx/update-from-opentx-to-edgetx>
want to ask is it true on 4 in 1 radios if its in LBT you see way less supported protocols then FCC ?,"yes, having EU 4in1 firmware limits it to only allow usage of protocols that are legal in EU. for example, not D8"
"does it apply also if i have external LBT module ,. ?","I'm no expert, but that looks like prop wash to me. Oscillations when the quad is moving through it's own turbulence. @dogesTV | mobula 7 it doesn't matter. the internal and external module is practically the same thing. just in different packaging"
you didn't find any guide on updating 4in1 firmware?,i found a reddit post i mean. but its filked to official page I mean like just putting the query into google. immediately shows me 3 videos and one post from the official page. without scrolling. > how to update 4in1 firmware
i mean i dont want to update it ? i want to change it ?,"I don't want to change into a red shirt, I want to change my blue shirt to red. *same problem*. anyway"
internal or external 4in 1 modules doesnt matter its the same process ?,"yes, except for which menu option you use to flash it. internal vs external external because i got 4 in 1 module. i mean i want to flash also radio and also module i want to flash both with FCC ... what radio have you got"
Doesn't that ship with fairly recent EdgeTX?,100mw isnt enough for me :D if i paid i want to use the 250mw 100mw is LBT but FCC goes up to 250
Are you talking about an internal ELRS module?,"yes so you're talking about an internal ELRS module. not about the radio The ""controller"" part, is typically called the ""radio"". That's your MT12. it runs EdgeTX firmware. Inside of it there is an internal ELRS module. which runs ELRS firmware. and you also plugged an external 4iN1 module into it. which runs the multi-module firmware"
it doesnt have sd card i think ?,"It must have, it runs EdgeTX."
do i need to dissamble it ?,just use the data USB on it
uhm LBT ? i dont understand what are you asking,"LBT is the name of a communication standard. I'm asking what external 4in1 module you've got. HobbyPorter, Jumper, RadioMaster, some other model.. ohhhh. radiomaster :DDD"
so you have the RM 4in1?,yeah this one. And Mt12 for later This is not actually the latest version. because the latest version is more hassle xD
what is the difference ?,in the latest version you have to pick between sets of protocols
i mean i ll still need to pick so it doesnt matter ?,It'll change which protocols are available to you
the newer is just put into sections. both have the same protocols right ?,"did you even bother to read the screenshot i understood it like that the older is you get everything and the newer is you choose and that what you get https://tenor.com/view/wall-gif-24534315. In 1.3.4.0, you have to choose between firmware versions which include only some of the protocols i am doing this the first time so i dont understand half the time .... okay ... this is not a drone issue, this is a reading comprehension issue because the first sentence on the screenshot explains what you misunderstood... anyway. I'm giving you the older version, which doesn't contain as many protocols, but it contains all of the protocols that were supported at that point in time in a single package.. You can decide to switch to 1.3.4.0 later but I'm not going to fish through the protocols to figure out which variant is for you rn.. okey i mean it shoud have the protocols i need TLDR: With 1.3.4.0 the protocols literally no longer fit into the module so you gotta pick which subset of them you want. which I don't wanna deal with rn lets just go with the older one"
breh this is RC basics. are you completely completely new to RC ?,pretty much i mean i build more RC cars .... i just have the radio set up and i am good with it :D ahh f* it imma just guess aetr. can deal with it later
i mean i use the default one ig ? i never changed anything,download this file. power up the radio. connect it via its data USB port to your PC. the radio should ask what mode to connect in. there is a mass storage or SD mode
wait wait is this radio or module ?,"the radio may show up as 2 disks one of them will have many folders, that's the one you want. find the FIRMWARE folder. and put the file you downloaded there. yes this one. FIRMWARE folder. put the file into it"
done. just to be clear this is for the radio to switch from LBT to FCC ?,"no this is for the RM 4in1. now unplug the radio. assuming your RM 4in1 is plugged in On the radio, exit out to the main screen. press SYS. then PAGE> until you get to SD. There, navigate to the FIRMWARE folder, and select the file you just put on there"
one thing what if i didnt have plugged the 4 in  1 ?. :D,imma finish the guide and go eat lunch
does that mean i shoud plug it in ? :D,"once you have the firmware selected, long-click enter/ok on it. and then click Flash External (...). it will take a minute or so. anyway. that's the guide for the RM 4in1. deal with it on your own terms. as for the ELRS module, the process is different. you can flash it either through WiFi or through the radio's USB port (the radio acts as a passthrough for the ELRS module). ELRS has a very well written guide for both variants here: @dogesTV | mobula 7  https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/ hmmm w. its not in there what i put"
"?. I feel like you think up a perfectly normal response and then write 1/3rd of it. Imma use my crystal ball. and guess that you're not seeing the file when trying to find it on the radio. In that case, try to rename the file to something shorter. or restart the radio","the filename being too long really is an issue (or, was, thought they fixed it lol) okey it finally shows up. flash succsesfull"
i shoud select ISM right ?,yes. of course assuming that operating with such an RF standard is legal for you :slightly_smiling_face: you shouldn't need those
hmm ? :D. if i have done this before they shoud be installed ?,"I mean, the guide tells you how to figure out if you need the drivers. and you definitely did not skip the section which literally says. > This is a vital step and a common failure point. Pay attention. i installed it before. so :D AND DID YOU CHECK. if the radio is recognized properly. as the guide instructs you to. you're dealing with windows. it's always 1 or 2 updates away from kicking your drivers to the curb oh sorry my screenshot didnt went thru :D. yeah i checked"
and everything is done ?,pretty much. EdgeTX usually isn't EU-limited...
so radio is FCC and also the module right ?,"should be. well. Radio is ""doesn't care"". ELRS module is FCC. and 4in1 module is FCC"
my bad :D. if i unplug the module and put it into my boxer its still FCC ye ?,"I am astonished at how painless this was i knew this because i did this before :D with emilia :D. and it was alot of pain for her :D FYI. Your 4in1 module expects the channel order to be AETR. this is set up in Mixes of a model. AETR = Aileron, Elevon, Throttle, Rudder IN THAT ORDER so CH1 = Aileron, CH2 = Elevator, CH3 = Throttle, CH4 = Rudder. they're plane terms. but it means that throttle is expected to be on CH3 in cases where it matters"
do i need it set it now or is it set ?,"Only once you start dealing with connecting stuff to the 4in1. For simple PWM receivers it doesn't matter. for toy/built-in/gyro stuff it might nah i am using PWM recievers on some DSM receivers, the channels are labelled as RETA. instead of 1234. so it will be translated (assuming AETR on the radio)"
how is the prop attached? nut or screw?,"Hi guys was just taking my drone apart to travel can't get one of the props off tho, any tips"
Should I just use one prop hold it and rip it?. Full throttle?,"When is the dji neo being released. @Swirf I'm not sure, i didn't know that was even a thing Yes it is being reliased The bolt screw thing is off but the prop doesn't come off all the others came off smooth twist the motor/prop in opposite directions and pull there is a very illegal way to solve this. *that involves throttle usage* Hmmmmm. Might have to cus it's not working just make sure that it can't take off :slightly_smiling_face: @wolfy personally, I'd either tie it down or step on it while wearing a solid shoe. plug in the battery, arm it and give it a couple throttle pulls. you can try to do it in crashflip mode too Hmm ight I'll try by hand a bit more"
"what do i need to look after when I want to buy props for my 3.5"" build with this motor (https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/gts-v3-1804-2450kv-brushless-motor-by-rcinpower-10697.html#/1-color-blue). can it be like this? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/gemfan-hurricane-4023-4pcs-6473.html#/3-color-green. or with those 3 holes https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/hqprop-t35x25x3-2cw2ccw-pc-9537.html#/8-color-orange","You want T-Mount propellers. both you sent would work, the first one would come with an obnoxious adapter. second one is easier okay so these wont work but the HQProp ones do work. ah okay. thanks :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Because you have no props on it?. Physics?,"It gets worse when I put a propeller on it.. and I don't know why but when I press the arm button the motors start spinning at full speed well the arms on that frame are literally flexing so that's not great. probably because your motors are spinning the wrong way or you have your props on wrong or the board alignment is wrong, or the motor mapping. or all of that at the same time :Harold: When you press the drone from above, the propellers spin normally, but when you put the drone somewhere and turn it on, it goes crazy"
"Here you go, check any of these, with props off in case you run the motors (you don't want to lose any fingers): https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146. What about this? @Efebstnci",the problem is i havew tiny motors and really hard to tell how much they are putting out without props on
"Just run the motors through betaflight with the props removed and a battery plugged in, and feel with a finger on the side of the motor which direction they spin. Also important to know if you run props in or props out. What size drone is it? Or which drone is it?","i alredy tested the direction of mots and when put pros on I was sure i put them on right. So I thougth it was a problem with interpration of radio, because it flew well, just full throttle in the air and then disarmed it and had hard crash its a custom 3 inch toothpick, with 1204 motos and hdzero and 2s Everything with your radio is fine. And throttle aswell so when i went into betaflight, the throttle signal went from 1000 to 2000, like always Even when everything is put on right, it's also important to have the settings set correctly in betaflight.  Because betaflight has to know aswell how the motors spin i am gonna test now motor direction You don't have to explain me I understand it.   In betaflight yes, make sure to double check the motor order and motor direction. Something might be wrong with the motor order. ok the motors are bugging out like crazy, i hooke the quad to betalfight and put battery on (before check motos direction, was correct) and then enabled motos testing andc armed quad with radio, first it starete ok but then it went into a frenz for some reason, where motos 2 and 4 where full throthel even when contorller just sent a bit of throttle. i will record this to show you, this has never happend to me. Ok so first I armed the quad and it was always in a flat position, then I just move the throttle to middle and then back down instantly, but you see tithe mots going crazy, after that I disarmed the quad"
"you have these sliders, use these sliders to spin the motors instead. is this your first drone or first self built drone?","i already built 3 and did all myself, but i never had this problem, i just did it with the sliders, first each motor itself set to 100% and then all of them together, but everything was normal, nothing buggy. i also have a 20A aio: https://betafpv.com/products/f4-2-3s-20a-aio-fc-v1 so there shouldnt be any problems with to little power to motors"
What is better option for charging the battery? (Let's say I'm flying three times a week.) * Charge after flight * Charge before flight * Charge 50% after flight and rest 50% before flight,The last option. Always charge the battery to storage voltage after a flight--that is effectively 50% charged. Then charge the rest of the way before a flight.
"Wondering if anyone knows the question to this. Going to wake up super early and do my first sunrise FPV shot. During sunrise, do you need a ND filter? on the gopro or due to the type of lighting can you get away with not using a ND filter?. On the gopro ill be recording 5.3k 30 fps and shutter speed will be 1/60 .",the answer is It Depends - just go out with filters and see if you'll need one on the spot. no way to predict it
"does anyone know what the exact procedure of a ""full naked"" gopro is? Most fly with the front screen in a case but what I want is just mainboard and lens like what is found on the redkyte build but I cant find the exact steps and what firmware is flashed","it's worth flying with the front screen from what i hear - easier to build + you actually have some awareness of what the camera is doing its a 3"" freestyle so the extra couple g matter to me"
i personally have not seen anyone do a naked gopro 12 without the screen. last one i tihnk you could do that on was the 8?,"I believe flywoo do it now. not that i could find on google. i might be wrong, just going off of expierience. https://flywoo.net/products/flywoo-action-camera-pro has the screen the screen is seperate and click in when you need it. via usb thats the back of the camera tho this is what im wanting this is a hero 6. he wants without the FRONT screen but red kyte claim it can be done with the 11 and someone on youtube did the same ah my bad. thats alot of nakedness"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRcHgO8wRS4,i cant find evidence of it anywhere online other then what you showed ye thats my problem there isnt much do go off except the fact the red kyte are the only ones who do it
@The GGManiack you own Mt12?,"@dogesTV | mobula 7 no, but radiomaster ELRS stuff is all the same internally pretty much. I have a RM Pocket I wanted to ask if you know if i could posibbly put something on the 3-pos switch to lock all trim switches but Joshua remade the trim switches into throttle trim, steering trim and those but i would want if its posibble to lock them at the value they are so if i touch them they wont change values you're cooking my brain lol It is possible and easy to lock the trim switches in EdgeTX. Downside, you have to do it for each stick on the Input model settings tab. I understood unly that is easy and posibble :D. Wait i know how to do it! Overwrite that joshua did! xD. I'm not seeing a reliable way to do it, but if you do, more power to you xD"
Is sky viper a good drone company to buy from?,Ig thank you there isnt another way just set manually each but its worth it I was thinking about somehow saving the trims to global variables when the switch changes OK got my whoop. Hooked up control is bound. Everything is good but look at video. This is what it's doing.
"I'm trying to set up a binding phrase for my radiomaster boxer but I don't know the wifi password to connect to it, does anyone know how to find this?",https://www.expresslrs.org/software/updating/wifi-updating/#method-1-hotspot
What produces these lines/grids on analog video?,"FYI I may have figured it out. @dogesTV | mobula 7 this LUA script, when put into scripts/functions, can be triggered by a special function. it will save the current trim positions on FM0 into global variables 1-4, on FM0. since FM1 inherits the global variables, it also gets them. so, you use a switch to enable FM1  AND change the sticks from being direct sticks to sticks + GV1-4. .. *i think*"
"congratulations, you made me learn EdgeTX LUA @dogesTV | mobula 7. do they change with motor throttle?","Uhm i alredy done it :D. I just copied it and changed some things xd Massive respect, LUA is painful They appear after the drone is armed I feel like chat gpt could help with that if you ask very specific question"
"howww. like, it keeps the previous trim value?. while disabling the trim buttons?","Wait i never tested if before :D I mean explan. cause I couldn't find a way to do it if I disabled the trim buttons via flight mode, the trims went back to center Uhm i just copied to set value to 0 :skull: If i press button it sets trims to middle. I am stupid why i havent tested it... xD. well, with my lua script you should be able to achieve it idk. only got so far so as to make the global variables thing"
Will it go boom boom?,"in Special Fnctions, you make a function which runs the Lua script, 1x, when the switch changes to the ""lock trims"" position. in Flight Modes, you disable trims on FM1, and make the same switch position turn FM1 on yea. you made me learn EdgeTX LUA lol If it Works you need promotion dw I already work at a fairly large international corpo. :KEKw:"
Lets try it out and ask you questions because i know you wanna answer them :3. @The GGManiack this script shoud lock the value of the trim ye ?,"no. the script is a part of it i think its better if i dont ask questions about the script :D wait lol I'm trying to figure it out myself :face_with_tears_of_joy:. When the script runs, it saves the trims to global variables imma make a fulll guide. min ngl this radio will be good :DDD. yeah i have no idea what to do next :DDD omfg the trim values are cursed. moment. the script needs to do meth. I mean math. I need to do the former"
.-.. so the script is wrong ?,well. not entirely. I just wanna make it simple -1 china point because it didnt go boom boom or it worked :C basically for whatever idiotic reason the trims give me -128 to 128 if i would run it my car would levitate i assume standard trims should be -25 to 25. lol. but you could enable extended trims which would be +-100. fml. OKAY I THINK I HAVE IT FML @dogesTV | mobula 7
okey. so uhm what now ?,"Context:  I'm using the SC- (middle SC position) as the ""locked"" position Here I set SC- to trigger my lua script (different file name). the 1x is there to only trigger it once. and the checbox at the end enables the special function yeah yeah i understand :D then, in Flight Modes, I have them set up like this. FM0 is the default ""normal"" mode. FM1 is the ""locked"" mode, triggere by SC-. Note: in FM1, its Global Variables are set to inherit FM0, this is important"
does that mean i shoud do the same ?,"Then, in Inputs, I have I05-I08 set to use G1-G4 as source. And then comes the Mixes tragedy In mixes, I add the GX Input value to each stick channel but only when SC- is pressed The weight has to be set to 200 because for some stupid reason it's halved"
"the order of the global variables is... idk. RETA?. probably?. meaning that G1 is R, G2 ie E, etc. guessing. I know that for me G1 is Rudder xD. with all of this. it f*ing works",how did you even do this without owning the mt12 .-.
I have a Pocket?. same thing,You can if you wanna. I'd recommend making a new model to test it on :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: nah its good. i have backup and its from JB anyway I may come up with a simpler lua later on. but not rn xD. I already thought up a way to make it considerably simpler :Harold:
first programator rule: does it work ? dont touch it,"There are three rules, actually. 1. Make it work 2. Make it *right* 3. Make it fast User-proof is a misconception. There is no such thing you started with ""make it right"" The only true user-proof software exists in my dreams :face_with_tears_of_joy: If you have a fc mounted towards front of the frame so that you mount the vtx at the back would this have a significance in flight behaviour compared to mounting closer to the center. No real difference these days imo"
did you put the file I sent into scripts/functions?. idk if I mentioned it,"yeah yeah i put it in there. It works now it was because of the name ... fml. sorry. mine was named test, I renamed it before sending. what a stupid issue again xD hmm i have a little issue on this one. they are alredy done little bit Joshua did something with them .... wait hm. idk if joshua uses the global vars somehow i am in drive modes .... :DDD"
ah. same thing I guess?. just different name because land vehicle,i ll just select the third one ... code stays the same. my code changes the global variables on FM0 and other FM's can inherit global variable values from FM0. idk if joshua's model uses global vars
one little issue. you wrote 4 trims ?. @The GGManiack i have 5 trims .... i have feeling it will work 50%. what is the input ?. wait nvm. one thing. i am not sure what source to select. because you have 4 different sources but i ll have only 2. it did not work .... off. on. its broken :C. i mean still good work,You have throttle pitch.... I only have throttle and steering. I put 03 and 04
Wait :stop_sign:. https://youtu.be/DcJnIJSHdgg?si=Lb7GQY7WDYVZ6xOQ. Watch this video maybe because he shows there how he does that. + 3 of those things are done in global functions i think and that is not same as trim i assume,"oof, didn't consider that... will try to adjust the lua tmrw. *well, today at this point* oof. what are you trimming anyway So that will require a something else to code. I assume. There is a image under the video :D"
"I mean are you trimming throttle, steering or both?",I mean i ll be using all of that so ye hm imma haev to check it out tmrw. OMFG YOU CAN CHANGE THE RANGE OF GVARS MOTHERFFFFFF. yeah imma go to bed before I get more angery Uhm i think radionaster through alredy of this. It Works 50% I thought up another way to potentially do it. but my brain isn't working enough to implement it rn
"How would I fix that. Get a better antenna?. It was transmitting perfectly fine until I crashed it, so don’t think it’s that","Can someone please help lol Black screen means the vtx is not getting any signal, but is still transmitting. Yea check the connection to  the vtx Everything looks fine. It’s only when I unplug the camera then plug it back in that everything works. I was thinking it could be a dead camera somehow. But it’s also not showing any osd"
If you have a fc mounted towards front of the frame so that you mount the vtx at the back would this have a significance in flight behaviour compared to mounting closer to the center?,"I’m not an expert but I doubt it, unless your antenna is heavily obstructed or your vtx or really heavy, but idk hey guys. can someone help me pick out a sharkbyte vtx. I can't find any with 20x20 mounting it's called hdzero now bruh. sharbyte is $140. the vrx for hdzero is $220 someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think sharkbyte was the old thing and when fatshark (producer of sharkbyte) got bought, then hdzero made their own VRX that was like sharkbyte, and so hdzero is what its called now so sharkbyte is basically just hdzero"
"um I guess kinda I think?. no more sharkbyte, yes more hdzero","Frostbyte and Sharkbyte *are* HDZero. They're the same protocol. Frostbyte and Sharkbyte are just older products ok yeah, thats what I thought"
did you report these findings to the edgetx team?,"Yes I have, I used to have my telemetry including GPS params working alright before the EdgeTx upgrade from 2.8.0 to 2.10.3. The upgrade reduced the number of sensors from 24 to 18, and I couldn't see GPS params anymore. (Yea yea rescanned and deleted all and rescanned and all that) Then I downgraded EdgeTx to 2.9.4 and rescanned - GPS parameters appeared, making it a total of 24 again.. Another story of firmware downgrade fixing things with the controller! :slightly_smiling_face: Yes, a bug is created"
If I rotate my fc 180degrees. How would bf know that I changed it. What settings do I use ?. Thanks for the quick response. Going to wrap up my new build,":pepodance:. kinda hard to tell from the image but your motor wires seem very close to bridging, make sure 100% they are not Thanks going to put new motors on and make it clean. Got all my qs out of the way now to clean up time the ones right above that. not mag alignment oh, thats what i change"
"i want to buy a soft wire box like that, which awg should i look for?. i already got a 14awg battery cables, and i need one for motors and stuff...","motor wire for 5"" is around 20awg, all other wiring is 28-30awg"
https://youtu.be/oXq5vDVO4RI?si=gwTSP6cOygxi_xa8 what about this ?. are those analoge ?,great. but those are starlight i found this video
"for anything that isnt battery or motor related, should i go for 28-30awg of solid core wire or stranded wire?. Like this one",always stranded. also for battery connector nothing in a drone will benefit from solid core. maybe except really thin wires for tinywoop motors but that's about it
this is a solid core wire right?,"u dont need solid core for your drone.... ya i just wanted to clarify that i added the right picture solid = one single ""wire"" stranded = multiple small wires"
im planning to order a mix kit of the wires What is more comfortable to work with? 28awg or 30 awg wire?,"depends on the solder pads/flight controller. i order always from here for color: https://aliexpress.com/item/4000485605478.html and here for black red https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002911374376.html. personally i would just order 28 and 30. its so cheap. if u order a certain amount of $ u can apply shop coupons, so it will get even cheaper."
you mean the vtx recever  ?. i know im a bit concerned bc of space issues,"no the one thats on the drone sending video to your googles, that one is **not ** included"
how much does one of those cost ?,that also depends :slightly_smiling_face: ive caluclatet the cost for vtx to max 250 € It's basically the same
"what do u mean with ""vtx"" exactly?. just whats sits in your drone?","If you just mean the part that's inside the quad, then yah yes, ive got the coba x. googles An analog vtx + camera is like 70€ yea 250 is plenty for analog If you go fancy it can go to 100€, but not much more"
what do you like to work with?,"but the thing that bardwel features costs ~150€, so u pay that plus a usualy analog VTx i want to get the night vision kit thats why i calculate 250 because i used 12awg and 14awg and for me 14awg is diffidently easier to work with On my miniquad I use 28awg I think, but I usually just use whatever wire comes with the part, the only place I don't use the included wire is maybe on tinywhoops where I use magnet wire its just that this is the first time i build the drone, but ive got pleny of flight expirience with the nazgul 5 on 6s Then get the caddx infra vtx. Other infra cameras cost a lot more thats what i was thinking about Well it's pretty decent"
doable with time and patients. but why a night vision one as the first one?,"ive got the nazgul 5 so i have enough experience in flying at day, its just that i find the idea of flying in the night really interesting yesterday ive flown my nazglul 5 relativly late and almost crashed bc i did a powerloop and didt saw shit xD. i find the idee and tech just interessting and im amazed by it Go look at the foxeer infra red cameras you mean those for 2k i think that would be a bit toooo expensive xD Imo, after building a few quads, it's about as easy, expect that for the first plug in you are afraid it will literally explode hahahah xD  i remember how scared i was after building my pc, then it didnt turn on and i realising after 5 min i forgot to put the power supply to on xD I had to essentially rebuild all my quads about a dozen or so times each up till now, and I still feel like they might explode every time I plug it in on the bench"
but how hart is it compared to building a pc is it too just like bulding lego for adults ?,"Yeah but a computer cannot randomly decide to jump up and cut ye fingers off because you were dumb and left the props on, or catch on fire, or short and have the lipo go kaboom, or have the lipo next to the quad while the props are on and the esc decides to go full burst and cuts up the lipo then the lipo goes kaboom on your desk (hypothetically). Pretty much. You just have to be more careful"
uhhhhhhhhm. so should i have a fire extingusher near by xD ?,Yes. And an ammo box to store the lipos
but isnt it recomanded to not have the props on when buidling ?,"So they don't burn ye house down i already have many lipos even bigger ones for my helis but not in a ammo box xD It is recommended to *not* have the props on when you are building or configuring it, but I usually just get lazy and leave them on, and now I have cool looking scars. You don't crash your heli lipos into sharp rocks"
so with configurating you mean betaflight ?. i havnt flows heli for years xD,"Yeah, assuming it runs betaflight. Well, with fpv the batteries are much more exposed and take much more of a beating"
huh i never put them of when my drone was into betaflight but it dosnt need to have the lipo in so i wasnt concerend that much. https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Fireproof-Explosionproof-Waterproof-Charging-Resistant/dp/B07XG8VM8P someting like that ?. https://www.amazon.de/feuerfeste-explosionsgeschützte-Organizer-Batterieaufbewahrung-Netztasche/dp/B09TKKL4KT/ref=dp-upsell-widget_d_sccl_2_1/258-5382170-6873829?pd_rd_w=QYBd3&content-id=amzn1.sym.4799a452-aee9-4133-b3a7-ca99b46296f7&pf_rd_p=4799a452-aee9-4133-b3a7-ca99b46296f7&pf_rd_r=QX8RZW0EMEVD83Q4VM1D&pd_rd_wg=FZvY8&pd_rd_r=a0fd5133-6b65-4f87-962f-aca81651fdf2&pd_rd_i=B09TKKL4KT&psc=1,"i can already guess from the link u posted but make sure to click on your region in #extended-roles. that works but something like this https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/steel-ammunition-box-2040.html#/9-color-black is prefered i dont know if its that smart to get someting like that in my country haha. ill just buy the one on amazon xD if u didnt already guessed by my username, im also from your country and i have 2 of them :winking_face:"

do you want to get into a call ?,"I mean, there isn't an x-ray machine at the ups station, and even if there was, having an ammo box doesn't really incriminate you to anything, and I live basically next door to Germany, in France, and having an ammo box isn't an issue i dont know i think i just take the one from amazon, i think it dost look that good to have 2 ammo boxes in the trunk xD we can tomorrow if u want. currently about to go flying Just take the lipos out when you go to the field, and put them back in when you get back home"
hmm. are those safer than the boxes from amazon ?,"the ammo box is metal, so yes Just remember to remove the lateral gasket, otherwise you will have a makeshift bomb if they do explode, and the only safer option is buying a [batsafe](<https://www.bat-safe.com/>)"
"I have no clue… that was my only idea. Same motor all the time? Like if you hold the quad and rotate it around, does the same motor not power up?","Yeap same motor all the time, even when i lift it up and tilt it etc it doesnt power up. but after few ""restarts"" arming and going again it finally starts I don’t know… maybe it’s a bad motor, someone more experienced should help… I don’t know much about troubleshooting motors hmm oke, i have spare motor that i got with the purchase, but tiny things to solder :unamused_face:"
Why not use an FPV site like RDQ or whatever?,"How do I resolder whoop motor wires they seem to always break after a few tugs, I’m talking about the wires coming straight out of the motors cause i live in the netherlands"
okay then still?. !eushops,https://fpvmarket.eu/ en https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/874248418170638356 Yeah but when I get to twisting the motor so I can braid the wires then the joint just breaks
Oh idk. Is it all the motors?. Cause it shouldn’t break like that,"Well after a few crashes they break on me and I try to resolder. But I’m thinking that I just do a poor job so that’s why I’m asking if there is a proven method You can order at droneshop.nl and Drone-fpv-racer.com, they are both pretty fast delivery. Otherwise fpv24.com or rotorama.com There are also some shops in the north of Europe, worth to look at I think  that happymodel jusy supplies shit tier wires with their motors"
"Hello, is it normal to see this green thing in my video please ? I think that’s because of the sun.","I just checked, and yes, throttle does affect intensity and behavior (speed) of the lines @Sohail yes the throttle bar moves in betaflight Looks like it might be lense flare"
if a few meters maybe then most drones should be fine. like everything maximum of 400€?,"ia 14AWG big enough for connection from 6S lipo to ESC Hello, I am looking for a drone to take photos/videos, a drone that is resistant even if it falls from a height for a maximum price of €400, thank you. every drone can break So which drone can u advice me"
I think DJI mini 3 would be good. but if you can put extra 100€ on top of that and get the mini 3 pro. at least in my cou try i can get it for 500. idk about yours. where do u come from?,France.

"i tried following joshua bardwells tutorial on flashing elrs to my meteor 75, but after i flashed the green light wouldnt turn on and there was only a solid orange and a flashing blue light, how do I fix ths?",Why is it doing this mobula6.

"Ik I’ve already asked this about 10 quadrillion times, but can someone help?. Its really annoying because I have almost no idea what it could be",the compoort doesnt show up then you have a shitty usb cable okay mb. i think it might be softbrcked also i just replied to you. you already figured it out. you have a bad connection between probably the camera and the FC
How would I fix that?,"tried with two others, still doesnt work"
can you connect to betaflight?,Well I gotta take it apart nothiingn shows up in deevice manager
does Windows make a noise when you plug it in?,All the wires are completely connected so idk what’s happening then you either have a bad usb port or a bad cable. or you broke the AIO entirely just flashed firmware and it still turns on
Nvm. Jb had the exact same problem in a vid. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Mj9gDvPj0L8&si=aTgYo3nPmK6N1TWw,how can i check if thiis is true. this is my fiirrst fpv and i am unsure what to do
oh ok I saw that and was wondering if that was good. thats all I gotta do tho right? just set it up in betaflight?. been a while since I did anything with modes,how do I set up turtle mode on my quad modes tab on betaflight. It's called flip over after crash for some reason
cool. sounds like I also need to set max arm angle to 180?,oh yeah. i mean you always. want that off. max arm angle off and pre-arm switch I think I turned it off a long time ago but I almost always take off from level surfaces anyways. ok thanks. for some reason I cant for the life of me find where these are to check them
"ok so basically I set prearm to my momentary switch, and then to arm the quad i need to hold up the momentary switch and then flip up the arm switch. ?","max arm angle probably in configuration tab. pre-arm in modes tab psst. look in the top left of your screenshot ok I'm dumb, I thought pre-arm was a setting for a mode that allows that mode to work before you arm you finally get to use that momentary switch on your transmitter Real Gs knew how to use that momentary as a prearm before Betaflight added it as a mode"
Has anyone tried to repair a mini 3 broken arm?,"so to do turtle mode I need to prearm, arm, and then flip my turtle mdoe switch flip turtle mode switch. and then do normal arm. I'd hope that someone has lol ok, prearm, turtle, arm no. turtle, prearm, arm ok thanks, sorry for being slow. for how long I've been in this hobby I'm still learning new things"
did you perhaps. coat the connector?. for the antenna?,Uh no. That is one of those one time mistakes. Well on the bright side you won't make that mistake again well... I'm just hoping they haven't powered it on too much. because that thing is fried if they have No it’s not covered. The antenna just gets a little snug with the surround coating well it's one of the only things that can be happening. so
When i have radio fcc and pwm reciver lbt may it cause problems do they need to be both fcc?. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) able to help me with my question please?,they both need to be the same. use ELRS of course. just flash them both to FCC
What if i use fcc and lbt. It may cause issues right?,At least i know its true because it doesnt work. I forgot how to flash them :C you'll remember. just open the configuraoter. configurator
I am not sure only how to get the wifi part working.... @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i cant find it quickly anywhere..... Do you know how to connect it to wifi?,I dont see usb port :). Its reciver pwm then just power it on. wait for the wifi to come on. and then connect to it
Does anyone know a good build for around $200-400 i dont necessarily want to get up to around $400 cus im a starter but js a generally good freestyle fpv build?,Connect update and still makes the same issue @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I accidentaly broke one motor of my drone how do I fix it
How bad is it to fly with my mini 3 when the KP index is 6?,You might see some decreased range but it isn't going to fall out of the sky. If that's what you are worried about

Really quick question uh. what does SiK stand for in SiK Radio?. Writing a paper and I can't find the def. found it dwbi,"Hello wizards. I’ve updated my Mobula7 to the latest version in battling. I’ve set binding phrase ( same as controller ) and in befit it all seems good. I’ve added my ranges, drone is moving proper in BF, throttle and arm range are set up.  When I put the battery I get “RF signal critical, connected”, but the motors are not spinning when I’m arming. My throttle is to the bottom when I arm.  There are two red LEDs ( not flashing ) on the mobula board. Also I’ve set the beeper to proper range, detected in BF but not beeping. https://github.com/ArduPilot/SiK portmanteau of **Si**liconlabs and Kelvin SiK because it's sick as hell real.

Anyone know how i should setup this to get it to work?:grinning_face_with_sweat:,that looks like a fire hazard and a half
huh?. I see all black. it almost looks like someone chewed off the extra wires lol. oh god I know what they're doing and it's horrendous. they're skipping the first and last pin,"opting to reference the measurement to the main power wires which are technically the same thing. the first and last pin in a balance connector is basically the + and - of the battery, just on smaller wires"
so it should work then i assume?,"yes, but they're intentionally removing a safety feature lol. normally, chargers verify that they see the same voltage on the big wire and the small wire. to know that the balance plug is working fine"
"since it´s no smart charger, do i need to setup by hand how ""many"" 1s i wanna charge u think?","this charger literally can't test that. lol anyway. If you plug in 5x 1S batteries, then you want to set the dial on the series charger to 5S.  The charger will then see it as a 5S battery with the mAh capacity of one of those batteries (not a sum). If you plug in x 200mAh batteries, then the charger will see it as a xS 200mAh battery"
"is the ""Runcam Night Eagle 3 FPV camera V2 black"" an IR cam ?. bc on amazon it says starlight cam which means its not copletly IR or is it ?","you have 4 batteries plugged in.  I hope they're plugged into ports 1,2,3,4. in that case the dial should be set to 4S. and if they're 800mAh, then for 1C charging the current should be 0.8A"
@The GGManiack wanna hear the news? :D,"They dont fit in 1 2 3 4, only in 1, 3,4,6 then it won't work. you have to fill them up in order I finally finished figurating the Mt12 and i am trying out the Rm4in1 and i just need it binded but it doesnt just want to work... I cant find out what protocol my pwm reciver uses... first of all, show a screenshot of the External RF section in model setup for the model you're trying to use the RM4in1 So basicly theese batterys wont work with that board"
"Might need to, and if they are 380mah it should be set at 0.4 A?","for 1C(ish) charging, yes"
what?. don't confuse c and s,I ll just have to finish my task and then i ll send and hopefully you wanna suffer:ohno: 1C is a charging/discharging rate @xzet. kk :man_shrugging::see-no-evil_monkey: I just wanna check that the module works fine @dogesTV | mobula 7. also send pic/specs of the receiver
so this is a lihv wich is high voltage 1s? and charging rate of theese are 90c?  9A?,"you're really only reading half of half of my messages aren't you :grinning_face_with_sweat:. the 90C on the battery is its discharge rate and to convert rate to amps you need to multiply by capacity that´s why iam not getting it 90C (discharge) * 0.38Ah = 34.2A. 1C (standard charge for lipos) * 0.38Ah = 0.38A. If you put 4 380mAh 1S lipos in series, you get a 4S 380mAh battery. so it stays 0.38A Internal is off. Kr-331 i lost the case @The GGManiack :C. That is all now idk what to do.... I cant find what protocol is kr-331 i tried flysky-all sub prot, flysky2a- didnt even finish binding, kyosho, kyosho 2 i just got a fpv starter kit from betafpv and im wondering how i can connect my transmitter to skydive. every time i plug it in it says controller not found god f*ing dammit. of course it's the one edge case. @dogesTV | mobula 7 you need a newer multiproto firmware for the KR-331.... 1.3.3.46 at least Uhmmmm. How do i do that. Its doesnt have wifi I mean you already did that once"
eh?. you.. misread that quite a lot,Oh.... Sorry my bad. Lol. I tought i need to update reciver. Okey oh wait. you already posted on that github issue lmao
Yeah. I mean that guy was saying something but i am way too lost. Tell me how to do it. Its update for the Rm4in1?,I am not sure where to get it from tho... https://downloads.multi-module.org/
Btw how do i even chest what i have?,"or wdym. it shows the version here I was wondering what it could be :Dd anyway, put the firmware file on your SD card into firmware folder. and then flash external. You probably want Kyosho, FHSS as the protocol Yes. I need. What is failsafe... what happens when the receiver loses signal failsafe is what happens when the receiver loses signal What you mean by that the receiver goes into failsafe mode Oh. I dont have it connected. To anything. Weird this tells you that the failsafe setting in model setup is not set"
Oh yeah i ignored that :D. With this update do i get even more protocols?,"technically, fewer xD. because 1.3.4.0 is split into two different versions. one which contains more air protocols. and one which contains more surface protocols I want the second one which is the one I gave you Oh that mean i get more ground but less Air there are ""core"" protocols, and then there are air/surface specific ones. core are always included. but the less common ones are what changes I can't find an easy list of the protocols unfortunately. only the complete unseparated list -_-"
Yeah i found that aswell. Now i do kysho fhss?,"I mean fml what are the odds that you have the one protocol that wasn't supported. :face_with_tears_of_joy:. damn surface dwellers I dont even care at this point but i am so happy. Finally after 4 hours of pain. It can go thru 3 walls and like 20 meters pretty good penetration. Now just need it to bind to kyosho car and i am all set but you or somebody was telling me something about that aetr thing and i am not sure if it applies to kyosho cars it's just about which channel is throttle and which is steering. you can fix it in mixes tab. aetr is a definition used for planes Oh yeah i have that issue alredy then. Because my elrs and kyosho recivers are different One bas throttle on ch1 and other one on ch2 xD. just. copy the model. and swap the channels in mixes. xD Bruh i need to do it 4 Times I alredy created 4 profiles. Models idk how you run your shiz. I thought you'd have one ELRS model and one Kyosho model. if you have separate models then that's evne easier. just edit their individual mixes 2 elrs one 5 channel one 3channel i ordered the pack from radionadter I thougth you only had one model currently, actually. so I told you to copy and modify it. if you have multiple models already set up, then just set the mixes of each model based on the receiver it's got"
Where can i find failsafe? :D,in the model setup. near the rf stuff iirc Am i blind or i cant find it... I expeted it to be in External RF tbh. but they may have moved it elsewhere. idk I ll ignore it :3. Thanks for help sooooo much @The GGManiack <runs away to avoid explosion>
is it bad spinning your motors at high speeds(i mean by external forces for example high pressure air) because i thought maybe it would damage the esc somehow because of the motors producing electricity is that a thing or do i not have to worry about that?,"I mean... technically it is something that's possible. depends on the speed tho Well, the motor will produce electricity whenever it is spun up, may it be by the esc or otherwise, that's just called back EMF, in fact the esc relies on that to spin the motor properly, I would still hold it down so it doesn't spin, but it doesn't really matter that much, you aren't going to spin it hard enough to produce more volts then what the esc is rated for > , you aren't going to spin it hard enough to produce more volts then what the esc is rated for. ehhhhhhhh. I'm pretty sure you could. especially with an air compressor. but, it's going against the FETs I mean, I thought he wanted to use like canned air. Not an air compressor and idk what the breakdown voltage is on the fets. sameish thing. you can get stuff spinning dummy fast with a straw and asthma Yeah but one will pump out more air than the other, also if it's a small motor sure, but (granted I never tried myself) I don't see how you could spin say a 2207 motor fast enough with canned air to actually fry the esc"
li-ion pack?. but puffed?. what lion pack,i am using an air compressor and it defenetly spun faster than just arming
May be like 5%? Not much its light. 6s1p molicel p45b,If you use an air compressor might as well hold it yeah like don't do that. overspinning motors ruins their bearings. not to mention the slightly unlikely but still possible ESC damage
"21700 cells aren't supposed to really puff up, can we have a picture ?","Now that I think about it... I reckon it's just the battery shape pushed out of the configuration I had it in. ok thanks ill hold it then or is there a better way to clean the motors from sand because just compressed air isnt enough take them apart. cylindrical cells aren't meant to puff up @Sohail check if they're puffing up and if they are, it's no longer a battery, it's an IED Ye ill take apart the wrap and double check. it's almost as if I have a point to make based on what sohail did and what he's reporting *istg*"
If not I'll charge it up see what happens. Ty! If they are puffed salt water?,"ok thanks thats a good idea Sorry :(   god loves you if the sand is somehow magnetic, use stuff like blutac or hot glue (not too much of it, heat is an issue) to get it off the magnets if the motors are held together by c-clips, use something to catch the c-clip when it inevitably flies off. if they're held together by screws, heat up the screw with a soldering iron before unscrewing"
ok and another question whats the best hardshell case with foam inside for a 5inch drone with props on?,"The Molicel P45B cell is rated down to 2.5V. So you're literally fine they're at 2.5V after resting :Harold: Ye I saw that as well. What was scary I'll share dvr later was the sag fron 2.7/8. It was instant down to 2.6 then just slowly start to fall out of sky I mean it definitely went too low if it couldn't hold altitude Yea that part of the curve is a cliff Li-ions can often survive overdischarge with no ill effects. HOWEVER. things are a bit different when you overdischarge them during a high current load. that can be a bit worse. so like really check that they're still cylindrical and non-spicy. and charge very slowly Cheers mate. I'm charging ay 2.2volts atm, hopefully holds charge. Ye taking off the wrap shortly will double cheek.. Booooo cracked gps as well Literally looked like a first person view of a movie.... slowly decending down. All I could do was find it the softest tree :p One trick in regards to this, but it's difficult to pull off Batteries are ""spongy"".  If you take the load away for a while, they will recover, and give you a short burst of more power afterwards.  Sometimes it's better to let off the throttle, fall, and catch it lower down after the battery has recovered.. don't do it repeatedly though because it will make them get worse faster Hah, the battery equivalent of an autorotation landing. hah, it really is kinda similar Save all the energy for the last seconds, potential/kinetic, or chemical/electric. When you pull power from an empty battery, parts of it deplete more than others, reducing the % of the battery that's actually capable of providing power, which reduces the current capability, which reduces the voltage.  When you stop pulling power, the charge inside of the battery redistributes, meaning that while each part is less charged, more parts of it are charged and able to deliver current, so you temporarily get some extra oomph.. it's like if you roughly squeeze a sponge (without readjusting your grip) some parts of it will be wetter than the rest but no amount of putting more pressure into your grip will get the water out but if you release and wait for a while, the water will soak through the sponge again, allowing you to squeeze some more out @The GGManiack i think i am very good at finding problems :). I have another problem with my reciever :why: :pain: if you don't start describing imma start sleeping Er5c-i and also Er3c-i make weird issue when i connect everything and turn esc on the motor spins quickly for 1 second~ then stops and everything good... What would you recomend me to do XD"
does it happen on all of the outputs?,"Uhm great question let me see might be a good q for the elrs server Ngl this question you gave was really good. Its only on channel 1 and 2. On 3-5 works normally might be an elrs quirk. idk if it's a solvable quirk. ELRS server prolly has an answer They have that. I didnt know :0 That's a good tip I'll keep that in the back of my nind. Thankfully no puff ok, well, just be careful while charging and keep an eye on how it's balancing"
I got avata 2 from a coworker as a gift. I did my first outdoor flight today. It was nice. A little clunky but I was 700m above sea level so I assume windy make it harder. I have short questions 1. The video I found on my phone is without sound. Is that not possible to have sound? 2. The quality is eh. Ppl say onlinr it can be 4k 100fps. Is that from settings or I need to do smthing 3. Any tips?,"Ty!bro will do. Cells r looking good... wtf is this voodoo yeah liions are fairly resilient In fact my first li-ion pack burned itself after I shorted it (it literally burned, and melted the solder tabs) and it still works awesome as an lr and goggle batteries"
"Is this a ""I just need a new analog cam"" situation?. Cam is Caddx ant, vtx is built into my redfox aio whoop fc and I _did_ already try resoldering the cam fwiw","well no, that looks like you're not getting any signal. if it was just the camera that was broken you'd have a black/gray screen with OSD. so this is the VTX I'm definitely getting a signal. Several seconds into the vid is when I plug in the fc and you can see it go from static to weird distorted rainbow stuff with like a pattern. Vtx is def transmitting _something_ what goggles are these"
Unless I have the wrong vtx tables for my vtx then yes. the...really cheap $90 box goggles everyone used to recommend? lol idr it's a bunch of numbers and letters. I'll test on my hdzeros with their analog module just to be sure but I don't think its the goggles,make sure you're manually selecting the channels They're both set to raceband 2. you'll just have to take my word that I'm not using scan on my headset. hdzeros look a bit different but still no video. the analog module on those is showing grey with weird colored pixels all over it when I plug in my fc
"yep. not more warm than I would expect tho. this is the fc fwiw. https://sub250.com/products/redfox-a1-f4-5a-4in1-aio-fc?variant=43520269943042  I _have_ reflashed the fc recently and the manufacturer doesn't include vtx tables but I have reason to believe I'm using the right ones here (I found these in the betaflight docs under the vtx tables page for tramp vtx's). Including that because it's something I considered to be causing this but I don't think it is?. and yes. again, unless my vtx tables _are_ wrong but I don't _think_ they are?. EV800D I finally found the order from waaaay back. I'm editting the hdzero analog module footage to be shorter right now tho and I'll put that up too since it's a bit different. There's the view from my HDZeros. it's pretty obvious when I power the vtx on and then turn it back off",I mean that sure looks like a goofed up VTX then...
goofed as in broken or as in I might just be using the wrong vtx tables after all and my hunt for the right ones must continue?. OH WAIT. How do I implement this in betaflight?? It's not firmware right?. This file totally has the vtx tables and everything else my fc needs. got it,"Is there any way to see how many watts everything is pulling on betaflight OSD. I know there is watt hours but idk how to convert it yes, I have it set up on mine. one moment. oh wait I have it set to show amps not watts. Sorry about that, I don't see a way to display watts specifically"
"is 500$ enough for a digital 5"" freestyle build?","yes. assuming by build, you mean just the drone and not all of the accessories how much are digital goggles. cuz i would need those too Walksnail Goggles L are 200, X are 450. DJI V2 and Integra can also be found for 250-300 but they're getting old. i assume new ones are like 500 bucks but I have never looked. HDZero goggles are like 550. on the quad you can manage to spend like 300-350 if you do things right $600, and that's without antennas what a joke of a price still. lol"
Does it means that everything is fine?,It means that some things aren't completely wrong. the question is if i can plug a battery directly to the drone and be fine Impossible for me to guess without seeing all of the wiring and soldering
What do you usually assign to a 6 position switch?,"Flight modes, but most people don't have 6 position switches, or enough flight modes to fill one"
is a digital freestyle drone a smart idea or should i go with analog?,"Depends on your budget I am seeing ""Power"" as one item that you can add to the OSD - try enabling that. Watts is the unit of Power so I am assuming this should give you the instantaneous power consumption. I have never added that paramter to to the OSD since I don't know how it can help with the flying. I'd rather display the current. The walksnail avatar goggles is what I am planning on using, what do you think of those"
"The goggles X, or the goggles L, or the dominator goggles ?","Well then you are going to need to put walksnail on your quad. The gL only support walksnail, there is no way to use analog on them Cuz you take an L if you buy them :KEKw: Hilarious, but they are pretty good for the price, just no light 65mm tinywhoop if you buy them, and more long term bankruptcy"
how bad is it that my esc doesnt support bidirectional dshot?,"How do I inverse pitch and yaw in beta flight. I had to mount my board upside down @GaLfield_33 Update the firmware. I have a quad set to roll 180, yaw -45, for example.. It's an AIO mounted upside down and square on, rather than diagonally, if that makes sense."
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) ??,tf do i do. im trying to test the motors and this happens when the motors spin they draw current. the smoke stopper trips and breaks the connection when it detects too much current. you're not supported to use a smokestopper after you used it once to check that there are no shorts
@Vitroid do you think i can use battery directly after this test?,you only need to use the smoke stopper once
Is 20ms of latency bad for freestyle?. With digital,"Depends on who you ask. Some people aren't latency sensitive at all. Others can't fly digital because of it (and of the variable latency). But the latency of Walksnail isn't bad for freestyle if you don't mind the variable latency I was gonna use the walksnail L goggles Yeah you said it like an hour ago As someone who freestyles using HDZero which has basically 0 latency, the added latency of Walksnail makes no difference in how I fly Yeah, when I try to take off it doesn’t. It flips over. But all the motors spin Follow that https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146"
How much do these stack savers restrict airflow/ esc temperature?. I am worried of frying something inside when there is so hot in the summer...,"Unless you conformal coat everything (I do), the grass clippings and other detritus will kill microelectronics faster than the heat. foxeer seems to coat everything already"
whats the difference between tattu and tattu r-line?,"Doesn't stop me adding 422c to **everything**. I just wanna know if it is like a huge risk in these temperatures or if its aight Nah, it's aight.. People wouldn't use em if they killed stuff with heat :yellow_heart: Tattu is the company, tattu R-line is the product, which are the only tattu batteries worth buying imo No worries :thumbs_up: totally agree, if not r line, then any other brand like cnhl/dogcom"
what are the best batteries for a 3 inch toothpick?. im looking for a 300-600mah 3s,"Eh, cnhl blacks are shit nowadays, and dogcoms are expensive, I would get some gnb flowers nowadays for a not overly expensive battery tattu r line:upside-down_face:"
okay. https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/3s-450mah-80c-gnb-lihv-battery-xt30-by-gaoneng-12369.html these?,"hmm, the cnhl are relatively cheap atleast, but the are kinda heavy. I have some dogcom Ucells, they seem great but idk how will they last Yeah, cause the cnhl are actually a bit bigger than their rating (at least the 1300mah blacks are, but again, blacks have turned crappy) and the ucell is basically the new cnhl blacks, we just don't know how well they will perform over time, but they perform a bit better than the old blacks afaik ill see how the Ucells will last, i like them because the weight is similar to for example r-lines"
Anyone know how to bind a old naze32 board to a taranis? :p,"Not sure if this is the right place to talk about it. If anyone's done it, how quick could you pass the GVC qualification"
Anyone know why?. My flight controller powers on under battery but when I plug it in it just makes a highish pitch noise,https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1272966496670322750
"how good is elrs penetration? I know it’s like the best out there but can someone give an example or explain, because I’ve never really tested the limits of it myself",ask in the ELRS Discord and you'll get tons of science thrown at you. and also mention which frequency. It's a combination of LoRa modulation and tiny packets
is there a way to only calibrate the sliders?,"how do i figure out what elrs frequency my equipment is using because i forgot get a photo of the antennas. or just connect to the webui not really, but it's better to just calibrate everything anyway"
Anyone able to help me with batteries in series and paralel please my brain aint braining. Those cases are wires in series. I put them into parallel. Because i need 2s2p battery did i do it right?. Btw there will be also next step but i wan t to know if i did this right,"Yeah looks right, for a 2s2p"
Okay next step shoud be i connect those Black together and merge it into 1 right??,Hmm how shoud i solder it so it wont be too much pain
No i mean like those Red will go into the left Side of the connector. Like this but soldered.... This is just for showcase how will they be connected is that right?. Didnt think of that but Anyway needed to make longer wires sooo. Is it right what i send the image?. .. I mean its the almost same thing...,"Yeah, red to + and black to - Thanks for help i ll go solder it up"
i tried to update my skystars f405 stack and now its not being detected by my computer. can someone help me with that?. i have some backup files if its helpful,how can i see if a rt or tx pad on my flight controller is bad
Does anyone know where I should look to find a drone sim that feels closest to the real thing? I have tried both liftoff and velocidrone and they both feel very different.,seems to have done it thanks! want it more just out of curiosity and less for flying. with the batteries being so high voltage and seeing some pull like 90A it would be cool for it to just show the power being used They're all going to feel different. Velocidrone is the closest to real life according to most. all your skills will transfer over to real life no matter the sim. gravity is just hard to get right
"ok, I have about 10 hours between both sims and I think I just needed to hear my practice won't feel wasted.. any suggestion on what to practice? should I bother with race courses?","Racing and freestyle are two entirely separate skills honestly. do whatever you want, learn some tricks. just have fun. practice throttle control"
"does anyone have experience running bf on a chromebook?. i used to use mine for cleanflight back in ye olde days. i see they still have an app on the webstore, just not sure how updated its gonna be. https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/betaflight-configurator/dlgclabibdhkfnbkajgkplmkpndajfom?hl=en&pli=1",just use the website. https://app.betaflight.com/ whaaaaaaaattttt. how come ive never known about this
why tf do we bother installing it on a pc??,"not everyone has chrome this is great. ok sweet, imma be able to take my brothers old chromebook out to the field for pid tuning it's still very beta. has some bugs. and obviously requires internet to load soo ive got a hot spot. ill just try both, i gotta get this thing tuned"
"Why are you still getting ""Device Ready: false"" here?","Well i dont know :man_shrugging:. I tried everything that came to my mind  Plugging in battery, then FC usb Fc usb first then battery Only battery Only USB (that of course doesnt power the VTx)  Reflashed the vtx with the newest firmware Flashed the unlock, powered on and waited for the 3 blue led blinks, flashed the normal firmware again. Kinda lost for ideas. The only thing i kept my hands away are the google settings"
Did you include HD OSD when you flashed Betaflight on the board?,Im pretty sure but i will reflash it I believe there is also a HDZero preset you could use to do some or all of the configuration for you as well
"Yes i did use that. Just for my knowledge: if HD osd wasnt flashed, would it be selectable in the OSD Tab?","Yes it would still be selectable in the OSD tab, even if the firmware on the board doesn't have it included in the build"
Gotcha. But would missing HD osd cause „device not ready“?,"Should I get the meteor75 pro or meteor 65 pro tiny whoop Neither. If you're going to buy a whoop from BetaFPV, get an Air65 or Air75. No clue tbh nope still ""device ready false"". done nothing but applying the hdzero preset after flashing. i could try soldering the vtx cables instead of using the plug. Can also try soldering to UART4 instead of UART1 which is used by the plug Trying a new UART is an option, but honestly I'm not sure what else to check At least im not alone with that :hehe:   Will wait a little to see if someone else has an idea, otherwise i will head over to the HDzero discord"
"So some of you are aware I fucked up and my lr 7"" landed as the lion completely depleted of battery and just couldn't keep it on the air again. It's all OK and charged up well internal resistance all under 9.   I've noticed one thing though and wondering if it's a concern. The charged finished yesterday at 24.98v at 18:35 pm. Today nearly 24 hrs later it's sitting at 24.95. Is that normal?",Could be. I mean these are cells that are having to heavily recover. I would give them a pass for that Ye they got battered.  I'll give them over night to settle and see how they manage a cruise tomorrow. Ty 0.005V per cell is within margin of error

About 10 meters away from home, i activated failsafe so I can talk to my mate. However during that flight as I was hoovering to capture sunset and doing a timelapse. I went to 440m...   So at 3.1v of battery activating failsafe at 10m easy no issues.... but not when it has to now claim to 440m... ^_^ only realised when it reached like 200m where the fuck is my drone :D."
whats the difference between fullscreen fake and fullscreen exclusive in filfoff?,its in graphics options
is on board dvr worth it? and if so can it be put on a prebuilt?,"if you mean for analog, not really, extra bulk for not much, the image will still be crappy, just without the breakup, if you mean for walksnail or dji, well, it's already baked on the board those are antenna protectors you just cut them to lenght and slide them on the antenna, and then you use a hair drier or heat gun or lighter to pass over it for a second cause they are often just heatshrinks I wouldn't bother with it tbh, the image will still be as bad as the dvr, just without breakup, but if you really want to, you can buy a board and just add it to any prebuilt That line is telling you the elevation of the location above *sea* level, not how high you can fly. How high you can fly is set by EU rules for UAS, which I believe is 120m above *ground* level https://www.getfpv.com/runcam-mini-fpv-dvr.html for exemple, if you want to try analog dvr recording Thank you very much, I didn’t know that was meaning elevation avove sea level. Yes in EU it is 120m above ground level for people without a drone license or special autorization. umm after doing some checks it seems like a much harder plastic Please help me troubleshoot. One of my motors is not spinning. I've tried everything My walksnail goggles refuse to pair. Upgraded firmware, put the VTX in bind first, then the goggles and they just sit and do nothing Yeah, well it's supposed to be harder to protect the Rx antenna what do the leds look like red on the vtx but blinking green before bind. goggles have the red border and are beeping as they should you short press the vtx. it should turn red. then the goggles. and then once they're done the vtx led should turn solid green Yup, short press on both"
not close to each other?,"Moved them further away,. The goggles in the bottom right where it indicates signal strength alternates between no signal and whatever channel I have selected, the box to the left switches between transmitter not connected and choose a channel. Seemingly at random"
can you set it to channel 8 or 3?,"but then how do i attach it cus it doesnt shrink it more melts It's not on the FCC mode or whatever so I only have 4 channels, I will try 3 again"
are they on matching firmwares?,"Yea I just upgraded them both yesterday. They both did their proper reboot thing, although I don't have a way to verify on the VTX"
"Looking rn, how do I swap it to the FCC mode?","<https://oscarliang.com/setup-avatar-fpv-system/#Unlocking-FCC-Mode> Ok looks like I may have failed to do the firmware update on the VTX, so I guess I'll try it again. Wait. So the text document in here says 37 but the one I put in there says 38"
don't know how that log works. what vtx is this?,"HD Pro Kit - 32GB w/ Dual Antennas. so the led just goes solid red when i try to do a firmware update I just retired it and I think it worked, I don't think I power cycled it before trying to upgrade it. Yup that was it,. It's working now, thanks for the help"
"Hi What motors do you recommend for a ~1.5kg cinematic drone with ~20cm props? I currently have 1450kv but they are struggling a lot, today they failed mid air (they still work tho)",If you have an Android phone they have an apk too
"Which exact motors do you have currently, what voltage battery are you powering them with, and what exactly do you mean they ""failed mid air but still work""?","11.1v 5ah 3s lipo Motors recommend 50a esc, I have 60a Motors- “DYS D3536 KV1450 2S-4S” By failed I mean they just completely turned off mid air But after that they still work and spin perfectly fine. Btw they stopped working 3 times this day At first I thought it was because they were overheating (as it was very hot outside) but I tried them now when it wasn’t as hot and same thing happened -Those motors are *hilariously* large for a 8""/200mm prop. -The motor stopping is not a motor problem, that is because your ESC is cutting off power (likely due to low voltage) -3S is crazy low voltage even for a cinema rig Oh I didn’t know any of that lol Thanks I’m a complete beginner and this is my first ever build"
I'm going to assume you also use some old ESCs that are all separate?,"No it’s a speedybee f405 v4 & 60A 30x30 4 in 1 esc stack Alright, no low voltage cutoff then, that's actually a decent stack Still, good chance the entire stack is shutting off because the battery voltage is so low Now that I think about it that’s actually possible. Because after the motors failed I heard the esc beeping like it does on startup"
If that's the case you are *murdering* your batteries. What voltage do you stop flying at?,"I’ve never actually properly flown this drone, I’ve only been doing low hover tests But tbh I accidentally discharged the battery to a dangerously low voltage once because I can’t get telemetry to work If the battery is below 3.2V per cell, don't even bother plugging it in, charge it. Once a battery gets that low, its voltage drops off a cliff and the damage it takes is permanent and cumulative"
"That depends, how willing are you to also get different motors?. Because I'd typically recommend 6S","For now I’m not sure what I will do I’m gonna meet up with a friend soon and he said he will give me one of his old drones So I’ll see, maybe I’ll just switch to that drone completely. But as for me I would honestly prefer to buy newer motors as I’m pretty sure 1450kv is way too much for this type of drone It is not, funny enough, it's right in line with 4S recommendations"
"Oh, even with these big props?","For an 8"" prop I'd be looking at a motor between 3008 and 3110 in size For 4S voltage, around 1450Kv is about right. 6S would be about 1000kv"
Oh alr that’s good to know Then I’ll stick to these motors and get a new 4S bat. Btw lipo or liion for best flight time?,Lipo. No way you get off the ground and have any reasonable performance on a li-ion pack on a quadcopter not designed for it Oh ok Thanks a lot :goodjob: I’ll see what I’ll do and come back here I’m a dirty iPhone user lol
"Im trying to install firmware to my new fc but keep getting ""not recognised usb"" when I flash it and it reboots on Betaflight. What can I do to get it to work?

Got a walksnail pro kit that's an analog thing silly Is there any I can connect to the flight controller or something and what would it do with that :thinkies: That's not a thing that will work Trying to just get a microphone instead of an action camera well. surely you can find a lil microphone unit. that records to sd card I might just get a runcam, the serial port looks nice"
Could be drivers?. Can you show the error?,close betaflight. run this. <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe> okay i tried it before but had betaflight open. It worked thanks!
can i charge a lihv with lipo charger?,a lihv is just a lipo thats safe to charge higher than 4.2
i want to make an external battery for my radiomaster zorro like in the picture . do you guys have an idea how can i do it?,18650 holder and a little USB charging board from AliE. or just sell the Zorro and get something nicer
i love the zorro tho:broken_heart:. its like flying with a controller. like this two?,"The controller shape isn't the only comfortable thing in the world. far from it i like it. :man_shrugging:. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) that completely misses the point :loudly_crying_face: I have a very old radio (that doesnt work any more) and it looks like that. AND ITS SHIT be a little like. attached to reality. and realize that that is so far from the same thing. and that even a boxer vs a t15 will feel so insanely different. because of a million factors including shape, mold, quality Its to big for me i think same way a ps4 controller feels different from an xbox one controller I really like the small shape of the zorro boxer is the same size as the zorro. and the zorro isn't small. Pocket and T20 are small a ps4 controller and the zorro are almost the same size the radiomaster is like 50 percent bigger wdym :loudly_crying_face:"
nahhh i dont feel it. if you ignore the screen its almost the same size. almost. like come on are you saying that the t16 for example is more comfortable than the zorro?. how from a conversation about external batteries we went to talk about radio sizes:loudly_crying_face:,"no one is saying that. or has ever said that. and it is so irrelevant and I have mentioned a bazillion other transmitters Hey one question, so im designing my antenna mount tpu piece rn and I was wondering at which angle the antenna (analog) should be mounted"
"so let me ask that like this, if i wanted to change my zorro to something better, what will you recommend to me?","You said you liked small, I would go T20 if that was the case."
"I just installed a new Flight controler into my darwin baby ape, the same one as before and i am now getting a cpu overload and it wont take off, what can I do about this?","If you want something of roughly the same size, the Boxer Crush or T15 would do you great and are both varying levels of comfort.. Smallest and cheapest would be the Pocket. Lower the pid loop frequency and similar settings"
can you elaborate a bit mor eplease? Ive never touched the pid before,"garbage. PID frequency and gyro frequency, you lower them but I can't really remember what tab they're on okay, ill have a look"
its the DarwinFPV F411 AIO Flight Controller. would 4 be good?,I mean you can try it out alright. thanks mate. It worked!! Thanks again :folded_hands:
had an issue at the end of one of my flights today.. i have the recording but unsure if i can share video in here to get an idea of what happend?,Does caddx let you cancel orders :Harold:. Box controllers are pretty comfortable. I got the radiomaster pocket and love it the reality is is that the shape doesn't matter. what you hold on to and how it grips does. the fact that they aren't able to even fathom that different molds and shapes and grips are in the back of different box radios is a bit wild to me
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) see the video by any chance?,"it doesn't have an extension. so you messed up uploading it It's not, it doesn't have a file extension"
got a video with OSD on it?,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) :index_pointing_up: betaflight OSD not the goggle one but. look at right after your quad stops rolling. the uavBat value. your battery got disconnected/something died and your FC lost power
no betaflight osd on this drone its caddx vista. unless theres a way to get it?,there is. but that was good enough
noted would this be in the blackbox if i connect the drone to betaflight?,you could check but no clue. I would replug the wires between the esc and fc. and get betaflight osd because how are you even flying without it This is maybe my 4th real flight with this drone and i just use the battery voltage in the goggle display to tell me when to land :grinning_face_with_sweat:. Ive seen people mention the wtfos thing for betaflight but also heard of it bricking the goggles so was unsure if i should do it do you have the v2 goggles pretty easy to do. <https://fpv.wtf/root> got it ill start that tomorrow morning thank you!
You'd sell one to me?,"OK how can I straighten these. I might just get a new flight controller at this point why not just. solder the wires directly. or replace the plug I might as well put a new plug on at that point it's easy enough to do Id have to buy new tips for micro soldering anyway I wanna get a TS-C1 alongside my TS-JS02 Would it be possible to just heat the solder with a heat gun or something and drop the plug in place. I doubt I'll have luck with my iron absolutely. but uh, you'd have plenty luck with your iron it's just a new technique I'll probably just buy a new flight controller if I can't straighten these. I don't like soldiering to begin with and my morale are already low The thing I worry is that it is blowing air too, if you liquidize solder around it, tiny ICs like capacitors might fly off…. But it might be possible. The plastic will melt before the solder tho. (The plug plastic… I think) no. hot air stations are precise. they have precision nozzles, air flow control and temperature control if you're heating up things you don't want to heat up, it is user error. I believe in you wooper. just remember, like actually remember. that in the end you'll end up with something flying. and you'll have fun What's the plug called. I'll get some off AliExpress and try it's a JST plug of some variety Im just going to use the soldering tips I have though If I'm going to get a new tip I might as well get a new FC Flight controller plug. Iflight blitz ATF435. Like $35 well yeah but does it plug into the esc wtf is with these companies and only having bad 3d renders Those 2 big plugs connect yup I'm just seeing if there's dedicated pads for it or not. but there's noyt. I mean I'd just try to force the plug into it personally. otherwise direct solder, or see if I have a replacement well no like. personally. I have a bunch of JST kits lying around just for if something like this happens or to fix balance wires for batteries and such Well this is the only one I got considering its my first drone I'm building :PepeSad:. I might cut the top plastic off or something. Get some way of seeing the pins go in so I can correct them as i try to fit it naww that'd completely ruin the plug"
"What if they grabbed the end of the bent pin, like with a pair of pliers, and pulled it lightly to straighten it out?",I've been trying to do that with tweezers for a bit you can't really plug it. you'd need to squish it. but these things are like. made to not bend so that the above scenario doesn't happen. loool So then how does smth like that happen @Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST) ^
Accidentally tried fitting the wrong size plug in to it. Like apply force to both sides of the pin?,"yeah. grab it really solidly. with your goal being to apply force to the sides, and to have them be straight enough to force the correct connector in I don't think these tweezers are putting out enough force. The tip just doesn't seem to want to give in. WE FUCKING BALLLLLLLLLL. https://tenor.com/view/fuck-it-we-ball-guy-in-suit-black-guy-in-suit-meme-gif-9989487814461476583. Just had to put my had more towards the end of the tweezers now I hope for you that the pins are actually okay. don't touch that anymore. lol I was fr about to take it out to check. We will find out after I solder a xt60 plug to the ESC"
no?. you transmit to a receiver. and you receive from a transmit. you don't transmit to a transmitter and receive from a receiver do you,I'm going to assume the RX and TX is a typo I just assumed you would match the letters. Think I did the same on my elrs receiver:face_with_peeking_eye:
"Quick question - in what flying mode such a launch (at a angle) is done? Acro? Angle? If it's done in acro mode, can the pitch & roll sticks stay at center while throttle is pushed up? Or should there be a forward pitch input too?. non-drone people won't believe the power figures a typical 5 inch / 7 inch drone pulls!",what voltage should i charge and discharge (when flying) my 6s lipo (1200mah if it matters) to to preserve the cycles on it and prevent wear
"Hey my TBS unify pro32 HV gets really hot really fast (like 80°C) even on 100mW, there’s almost no video, just a bit of flickering when i get my goggles close to the antenna. I checked that pitmode is off. Is it dead?. I found that the MMCX female connector is not in line with the vtx but rather bent upwards a bit, maybe that’s the issue?","Acro.  With the sticks neutral, the drone will try to maintain whatever orientation it is in.. With Angle, this would require full pitch forward with angle limits set to like 90° which isn't normal xD Gotcha. Will try in acro @Sunil FYI this is very dangerous. FYI there's also launch mode in BF, but that's not compatible with hand launching Yes I'm aware of the risks. Going to an empty field with a friend I mean dangerous to you(r hand) I'm a bit scared to fly acro LoS. Very comfortable & confident flying angle mode LoS. But Angle mode is like driving an EV with aggressive regen braking  :grinning_face_with_sweat:"
Can somebody give suggestion. I am using meteor75 pro analog and ev800d and some times when I am fling in the front yard in 15 meters from me and behind the tree I am loosing video signal completely. Any idea how I can fix it?,"I guess the SD card is the problem https://github.com/martinbudden/betaflight/blob/master/docs/Blackbox.md I think maybe the tree is causing a lot of interference.   In my experience when I had my EV800D, it was the same. Basic analog diversity goggles are just not great when large, water laden objects are involved."
can i take my fpv drone onto a plane?,"Nice! 2khz is also enough for fiktertuning and more than enough for pid tuning. I am able to see upto 1000Hz data yes, I double checked it This is so useful now.. unfiltered roll gyro. filtered one... looks quite ok.. but still need some tweaks.... Looks like rpm filtering can start at 150hz or somewhere around Yes sir. This is very interesting.... Have been flying for several months but I've never done this"
"aparently only used once but thats always up to debate, how could i test voltage sag?","just a question, does anyone know if the iflight nazgul xl5 can take 6s 1500mah, i see they only fly it with 1400 in their testing and in teir bundles, but i can only find one person selling lipos and they are 1500mah well, yes it can, think about it this way, say a battery is a tank, the quad is a pipe with a maximum pressure rating, the height (pressure) of the tank is the voltage (4s-6s etc), the width of the tank (capacity) is the mah rating, you could load a 5000mah battery on it, it will be heavy and fly like shit but you can if the voltage is within it's limits is there a visible/feelable difference between 1500 and 1400. or would it be practically the same, cus currently 1400 is working great, i get about 11 minutes flying when im out learning tricks there is a tiny bit more flight time, you probably can't feel the weight difference, but most people fly 1300mah since it's lighter, I would get some lighter 1300mah instead of buying chonkier 1500mah, plus 1300mah are often a lot cheaper yea i dont really have the luxary of choosing batteries in mauritius, the 2 i got rn i brought with me from germany when i was on holiday, and there arent any stores that sell batteries here,  and i dont think you can really post them, unless its by ship, these 1500 would be from another pilot on the island well, also second hand batteries are often essentially worth less since they are usually only sold when they have really bad voltage sag Charge the battery all the way to 4.2V/cell on a charger that displays the cells' internal resistance. If the IR in any cell is higher than oh, idk, 10-15 milli-Ohms, it's not worth purchasing"
"How much motor heat is a problem? I've got EMax Eco2 1900kv motors on a 6S 5-inch quad with AUW of about 600g, the motors almost reach the upper threshold of being ""warm"" after a couple of minutes of flying with some full throttle vertical climbs. When I say upper threshold of being ""warm"", I mean I can still touch the bell and hold my fingers on it indefinitely, it may be 60-65 degrees Celsius. (you can't keep touching things that are above ~70 deg C)",'tis a problem when you can't touch them. lol. and that could just be a tune problem I am tuning filters as we speak. you mean a PID tuning problem or filter tuning problem yeah. probably filter I assume I don't know anything about the in-depths of tuning. even though I really should Before-after  Unfiltered Gyro pitch noise Vs filtered gyro pitch noise with new filter tune

"Hey everyone, quick question: Is it true that I can buy the Radiomaster Boxer FCC and later update it to convert it to LBT? The FCC version would be delivered to me sooner, but I actually need the LBT version.","yes you can. but you also shouldn't need the LBT version yes. LBT is something to partly comply with the law in the EU. you can use FCC, it will be faster and more better but it would be more illegal"
cool thank you! Can I ask you one more thing?. what batteries can I buy from banggood?. for that radio I mean,"don't buy batteries from Banggood, it'll take ages to arrive there are a lot of 18650 Lion batteries but I read you can't really trust the capacity they say what country are you from Italy. ok nevermind then <https://www.nkon.nl/>. Samsung, LG, Molicel, Vapcell, Sanyo, Sony, Panasonic, Liitokala. those are some of the trustworthy brands wow those are cheap from there. wth I have heard that having FCC on the box instead of LBT can actually get the package hung up in customs longer, so it may not actually arrive sooner. YMMV though, I am not in the EU i have high doubts italy customs care. they don't really care about anything pretty often depending on where you are. lol for some reason there are 15 days delay for the LBT version, maybe that's the cause y'know.... https://fpvmarket.eu/. <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/>. <https://www.rotorama.de/>. these sites are decently priced yeah actually, I was going on banggood because the it websites were way too expensive check how much shipping is for you. rotorama ships from czech iirc drone-fpv-racer will be cheap. shipping from france is generally cheap to italy drone fpv racer also has the new boxer, not sure how much banggood sells them for. if u sign up for their newsletter u get 5% off https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/boxer-crush-elrs-radio-by-radiomaster-13007.html"
"oof it costs like a tx16s, what's new in this version? Only the color?","color plus CNC gimbals you don't want a tx16s unless you need all the switches u do not need that version. but its nice because usually a radio is something u buy once the transparent version is 189 https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/radio-boxer-elrs-24g-version-transparente-radiomaster-11437.html#/10115-version-sans_batterie thats the normal boxer.  the color one with cnc gimbals is new  both are great. CNC gimbals can also be installed later on if u feel like u really need them nice, I think I'll buy the normal version, I don't even know if I can tell the difference tbh great choice!  DFR also sells battery https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/2s-6200mah-lipo-battery-for-tx16s-boxer-by-radiomaster-11792.html yes its more expensive compared to single batteries u buy from another shop but u might save money on shipping. would compare price. or https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/4800mah-2s1p-xt30-li-ion-battery-pack-9975.html with less mAh"
would you suggest lipo or li-ion?,liion. but honestly wont change much
can I charge them through the radio anyway?. I mean through the USB C?,"I could probably use my phone charger, it is 80 W nice thank you very much"
Consider a Bassline or Crux3 then?,"Not really, but to be fair I have not tried it I like the fact that I could bounce off of obstacles, I could fly more comfortably and be a bit more risky you can bounce off of obstacles either way And I do have the Darwin baby ape a 3” I'd just get a Meteor75 or Air75 and give those a shot..."
always has been really lol. Meteor85 is I think the better one?. don't remember,"Aah okay I thought it was a newer one lmao the mob8 is better once you swap the frame, it's really it's only weak point also I don't see why you would say it's outdated if you just recommend the bassline, since the mob8 is nothing more than a bassline is a mob8 frame because of the frame goofy you can swap it dummy. and the motors are better than on the meteor85 It never got to shine because of it yeah but a frame swap takes like 5min, and the rest of the quad is arguably better"
"Aaah alright, yea the whole point I want to get a TinyWhoop if for durability. Better than air75?","you can just get a mob8 and put on the meteor85 frame on it and voila, best of both worlds. that's like comparing apples to bananas Bro I don’t know man. I’m new to this well, the air75 is a 1s 75mm quad, it is more made for outdoors and indoors freestyle, and will be pretty good at both, the mob8 is only for outdoors and will be very good at outdoor freestyle, but will punch a hole in your ceiling if you fly it indoors Alright thanks for clarifying it, much appreciated"
Why the volador? I know a lot of people using the Mark 5,Which Frame you guys can recommend for Freestyle which is durable all of those. but if you had to pick. get the volador cheaper. cooler. not geprc. I mean I'd just be getting a source one or demibot myself
is there a good way to remove some small jello in post?,"+1 for the Volador. I have a VX3.5. great frame, tough AF and nice to work on. If you mainly want to do indoors and sometimes outdoors, I would go for the air65 because it will be able to freestyle more easily indoors, if you want to do both about as much or that you prioritize outdoors, get the air75 1cm extra doesn't sound like much, but it's a big difference in surface area and thrust, and it also makes it more stable in the wind and outdoors in general, it also has quite a bit more flight time, but it also means it's harder to do the same thing as a 65mm with a 75mm indoors, especially if you aren't experienced, partly because of the extra thrust, but also partly because it is heavier which will make for example turns less snappy and it will have more momentum that you will need to account for (Also get the freestyle version of the air65, not the race version, the efficiency on 28000kv is pretty bad, and an 0702 motor doesn't have enough torque to handle well a 1219s prop at such a high kv) Confirmed....my 75mm tinywhoop made a big dent in my ceiling...."
so.... i need screws to mount the motors in my 65mm tiny whoop but they need to be long enough to go through the carbon frame and ducts. what screws do i need?,Thank you :folded_hands: Most whoop motors I believe use m1.4 screws.
"how long are they?. i need them to be something between 2-2,5mm","Idk how long, any 1.4m screw should work."
what is your ceiling made of lmao cheese?,hello everybody. im new to this. and i wanna buy a cheap drone. can anyone help
is it even possible to connect a fsct6b to a laptop:KEKw: ?,"Ok I neeeed help. So it seems that my drone has water damage. It crashed into the wet grass today and I instantly lost telemetry. But I fell from 20ft. AND I don’t want to put it into bf because it might brick. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Leave it a few hours to a couple days to dry full. Then try Oh ok. Like it powers up but falls How do I choose betweeen MR30 and MR60 The numbers refer to their amp rating. MR60 usually 4"" and above quad MR30 4"" and below The Air65 is only an indoor/outdoor quad because technically it is capable of flying outside, but you will have a terrible time flying it outdoors if there is any wind whatsoever, and I mean *any* wind. If you want to fly outdoors regularly, get the Air75, it'll be better at it. As for indoor flying, that's just a matter of practice."
Hey guys i need to switch my VTX into bootloader mode (it’s stuck in the blue led flashing rn because it failed to flash a new fw) can i do so by tweezers - and let them off after booting? Or do i need to solder it / hold the bridged connection for all the duration of flashing,"You should only need to bridge the pads when you apply power--once it's booted in BL mode, you can remove the connection I'd leave it at least  for a night in a dry place (if your place is humid, Air conditioner helps) before powering it up again.. I live in tropical climate, and that is what I do after wiping water off from my RC cars after a bashing session You could get the betafpv reny screws, they are m1.4 and the right lenght for almost any 65mm, plus they will save like half a gram, you just need to be gentle when screwing them in"
are they long enough to go through ducts and a carbon frame at the same time?,"if you use a fractal65 I don't think they will be able to go through both (also a fractal65 is kind of a weird choice, it's kinda heavy and carbon isn't needed for 65mm) na im using a mobeetle6 frame and im adding ducts to it why not just use a normal plastic frame, especially when you can get some really good and light ones like the mobula6 2024 frame/meteor65 air/newbeedrone liteaf (didn't try yet, but it's so light) im not like yall :smiling_face_with_sunglasses::loudly_crying_face: I would just use the carbon frame if you want to go duct less, otherwise I would get a light 65mm frame, it will just fly better, especially if you plan on using 0702 motors yup. okay ill buy the meteor 65 air frame"
"How to properly control voltage during a flight? I usually land when the cell voltage is 3.5 (sometimes 3.4). When I connect the battery to the charger, the charger shows ~3.65v and charges back 1.3Ah (not 1.4Ah as the capacity of my battery). Theoretically I could fly 100mAh longer or is it just that the battery capacity has decreased?","Battery voltage drops when the battery is under load. Even when that load is very small, like hovering. When you unplug the battery completely, the *resting* voltage will be higher than the in-flight voltage. Land when it says it's at 3.4-3.5V/cell anyway--that's best for long-term lipo care"
what is this used for?,"Thats a JST XH 2.54 mm pitch 4 pin socket.. And the battery voltage increases when it is being charged.  Analogy: Picture a crowded Tokyo subway train during rush hour. As professional pushers force more passengers into the train, the desire for those inside to leave grows stronger. Similarly, when a large number of passengers exit the train, the comfort level of those remaining inside improves and thus, their urge to get out of the train decreases."
Btw update FC in betaflight to newer version will it earase the settings?,"That is up to you, you can select the option to erase chip. But you must erase chip when upgrading from 4.x to 4.y Always expect the configuration to get wiped when flashing firmware. @xzet Always make a backup before flashing firmware"
Can i save settings then update and just put em back in?. Cli save to file?,"There are Save backup and Load backup buttons in Presets tab now. they work the same way (diff all) If youre upgrading from say 4.3 to 4.5, then dont resotre I dont have that ""old"" betaflight installed so only have acess to cli in 10.10.0"
"If you're upgrading from 4.3+ to 4.5, then you can restore with no issues.. Thre are a couple things that changed, but nothing major.. If you're upgrading from pre-4.3, then it really depends on the settings. PID tune and filters definitely won't transfer over. I mean, they might, but they won'T work the same. then do ""diff all"" in CLI. and save to file. @Sunil Do you mind if I clarify some stuff to you? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:",ish and save to file then save to file and post the file here. imma check it out
all Drone settings is in the CLI ?. like u said without pid etc,"""diff all"" saves everything that was changed from default settings"
so then i can update peacefully?,I don't know what was changed. I want to take a look at what's in the file. to tell you what needs to be deleted. and what might fail
So how do i check it?,"OSD yo. stats at the end of a flight. something like this. no, go ahead. *what he didn't mention is that you need a gps and barometer for that :frowning_face:. I dont got does… there is no max height or speed unless you want to do some crazy specific maths to see how high in the atmosphere your drone can still hover @Sunil  When flashing Betaflight, configuration is lost if the target is changed, or if the configuration data structure version changes (on top of being lost if you do full chip erase).   This means that you can lose the configuration during pretty much any flashing process, even if the version doesn't visibly change, or even if the target doesn't visibly change (but the manufacturer applied it improperly).. @Sunil As for transferring settings between versions -  PIDs and Filters are typically the thing you want to avoid migrating. The rest tends to be okayish. At most you'll get some errors when a value is removed/changes name/changes range."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhmtF44OH4 @5:25 onwards  JB is wrong then,"@Sunil  Finally, there's some specifics about 4.3 to 4.5 that JB missed :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. There are some thing that changed, but the PIDs and Filters in 4.3-4.5 are generally the same. Aha! I always felt like that i hate these new embedded ads it's always tic tacs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 are PID/Filter compatible @Sunil. there are some changes which will cause errors, but nothing catastrophic"
"And if i wanna update firmware, i need to find correct FC board and assgin manually?","@xzet small correction, added the correct rates type as the default has changed I'll do it manually in such cases. you can just check which specific commands errored out and fix the values later or ignore them. OSD stuff has changed a lot so that will probably error out @xzet"
So this one did u update?,"@xzet as for the target, your FC uses the OMNIBUSF4SD target, which still exists YouTube will be serving ads that are stictched with the content from the server side, so our chances of avoiding them will be less. Revanced etc will only help to some extent"
Do i get the FC name in CLI ?,"OH WOW I JUST NOTICED SOMETHING hah adblockers will always exist, this stitching is always going to be visible in some way or another unless they spend a lot of server pain on it > # ButterFlight / OMNIBUSF4SD (OBSD). It's not Betaflight. it's that ancient fork if an ad is served as a video chunk that appears as the content itself, you can't block it"
@xzet what specific FC is it?,"Not quite sure, i need to remove topplate and look :p"
if it's the heliospring imu-f then OOF. wouldn't happen to be this @xzet ?. hm. where do I know that FC from. it doesn't bring positive memories. it looks emax-ish. hmmmm. idk. but it looks like it's fairly standard. no IMU-F shenanigans,"it's like almost but not quite.... can't place it, but I've seen it before that thing deserves some canned air"
I have Mt12 and there is a slot for external module there are some holes for pins where i can find pinout for that i want to know what hole has what function?,ffs I know this board
is it hobbywing?. some ancient f*ing hobbywing?,"the stacking like that gives it away @xzet quick note this always ends up breaking. I have yet to see it not break. they tried to fix it with glue but.... doubt oh it connects that way If it breaks, it can be wired around... symptom of it being broken: random shutdowns, desyncs, etc. There's a reason why noone uses this today so its a hw906-yt1 v3.1"

I wanna check what gyro it's running. MPU6000, good. that's supported by the FW","I think iflight actually still uses this kind of connection here https://www.rotorama.com/product/iflight-blitz-f411-1s-5a-whoop-aio nah, that's soldered on both ends. I think. and through hole on both ends it looks like it's just a single vertical pin, no connector in between. just a plastic spacer. so this is fine. ish. I have some qualms with it but nothing crazy. @xzet you should be able to flash it to Betaflight, OmnibusF4SD, latest version.  If you're on windows, you will need to run ImpulseRC Driver Fixer before flashing"
hm. so plug in and run impulse rc fixer first?. Installing DFU driver. from impulserc. stm32 ready it said,you can ignore any warnings about chrome
Anyone know what pads I should wire my ELRS RP3 receiver to my DALRC F405 flight controller?,ik but you have to set it here Turnigyx9r with frsky mnodule. on the back
"@xzet what protocol does the receiver talk to the FC?. if RX1 and TX1 are not used by anything, and they're not shared with SBUS, then that's fine","I mean to deflate them Right now the current receiver was wired, GND, 5V and RC I'll buy some more right away That's bad!  Even revanced doesn't have preroll or midrolls @crypto according to this, RC, for SBUS, is wired to RX1 So I can't recommend UART1 as the SBUS inverter can cause issues with ELRS receivers."
Ah. Should I use TX RX 3?,this ->. image failed to send first time lol
Or is this the video?,"that's the VTX. and lol, I had the same. a couple of them in fact"
Hmm what would you recommend?,quick warning: make sure that VTX is softmounted @xzet. it doesn't like hard impacts. hard mounted onto concrete = crystal oscillator death grh reciver taped onto drone
So maybe TX RX 2?. Yea I think so,cause I can't find RX/TX3 on it xD @crypto
usally the big antenna back on the drone is just for video  ?,"yeah. smaller antennas are for rx. wait I got trolled. clicked on a F4 link, got a F7 pic"
Ok it seems like RX and TX 2 pads are not being used. Maybe those will work. Then I just need to enable serial RX for uart 2 right?,yeah that should be fine if not used. idk what the GPS connector uses xD. X4R it is then. not what I expected to see unusual and frsky. so bad and bad. um. it's wired up for SBUS
so radio protocoll sbus?,"so set receiver protocol to SBUS. and telemetry protocol to smartport if you decide to use it And you can probably remove OSD(HD) oh and untick ""no reboot sequence"". that doesn't need to be ticked in vast majority of cases well, load firmware (online). and flash firmware"
So to get it flashed. Figure out what board it has? shown in CLI? Get understand what reciver it has? (how to know frsky is sbus?,"BF Configurator shows the board type in several places. top left, bottom right. CLI - diff, dump, version"
and how do u know the x4r is having the Sbus protocoll?. i wanna understand what u doing :p,as for the receiver -  FRSKY receivers have two FC protocols which they typically use (unless you're dealing with something ancient that uses analog CPPM or PWM). SBUS and F.PORT. SBUS was originally designed for chained servos
and u see that on the Wiring / soldering? on the board or ?,"SBUS and F.PORT wire up differently. so I looked up the X4R's pinout ""initiating reboot to bootloader"" ... and found that it was wired to SBUS oh oke so i figure it out by looking at a diagram and the wiring. did run IRC Driver fixer wait for it to finish open BFC do the flashing again. don't disconnect FC I'm not going to be reading it for you :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
haha just posted incase or emergancy. iam connected and now i will need to bind it again i assume?. but i have to leave pc for a bit. could i ping u tomorrow or later?,binding is done receiver side. so if it was bound it will be bound. you can now try to restore your configuration The previous guy flew it so should be bouns
Does the model setup in the radio matter?. He has like 5 of em,yes. the receiver is bound to the specific Rx number. which can be changed per model
So the model created is for this rx ?,idk if the previous owner used different rx numbers. RX number changes how the radio presents itself to receivers. at least in FRSKY
Easiest to make a new model and bind again?,I mean you can just check if rx num is different in model setup. of different models. but yeah. you can do that too
@The GGManiack not gonna try now but radio should have this setting?,"Are these considered good motors for a 4s build   https://pyrodrone.com/products/emax-eco-ii-2306-stator-for-5-6-propeller-racing-freestyle-and-cinematic-hd-camera-equipped-crafts-2400kv They're a decent budget option for a 5"" build, but I'd *strongly* advise you build a 6S 5"" instead of 4S What about for a 4 inch build i would say to not do a 4"" build at all Those motors are too big then, but 4"" is sort of an odd size shiet. no clue. ah wait. looks like that's all fine. your radio just has to be in D16 mode"
Even tho i have a external frsky module?. Or should I bind using that?,"Trying to bind my zorro to RP3. For some reason the zorro won’t let me. Can’t get to the bind screen your zorro isn't set up correctly to talk to the ELRS module. it comes set up correctly from the factory, so you must've changed something"
did you create a completely blank new model instead of copying the default Zorro model?,"Idk what I changed. Yea. I think so The Zorro model is set up to talk to the ELRS module. other and new models aren't U followed some guide on how to bind to my toothpick drone a while ago. Toothpick is the one I created. This is for a new drone you should create the new model by copying the ZORRO model.. Check if you can get into the ExpressLRS LUA when in ZORRO model. @xzet The 9XR seems to have a XJT plugged into its back, and the X9D+ has a XJT internally... @xzet both of those will do D16 if you ask them to, with XJT as the External/Internal RF mode"
Hmm so maybe better with the x9d then?,the X9D is definitely the better radio
I have this pic from yesterday. XJT16 ? What is xjt that u are speaking bout,"Green is XJT D16. that's correct for your receiver. Blue is the RX(receiver) number (which lets you make sure that the radio doesn't connect to a receiver if the wrong model is selected). And Failsafe Mode is HOLD, which is WRONG for drones.. Should be No Pulses for drone shenanigans"
"?xjt16?. it says XJT D16. XJT is the module type, D16 is the protocol","In the link the picture says d16 and my radio xjt16 where the f* does your radio say XJT16. in the picture I tagged it clearly says XJT D16. yes, XJT, D16. no XJT16 anywhere to be found"
"RX Number explanation:  The Radio has a ""name"". Each one has a unique one assigned at ""birth"". Binding is the process through which the Receiver learns the ""name"" of the radio that it should listen to.   Now, there's the issue - what if you power up a plane, but your radio is in a model for a helicopter?  That could end very badly.   You want to somehow make it so that the receiver simply doesn't connect to the radio when it's in a different model.   That's what RX Number is for.   The radio doesn't actually present itself as its ""name"", but as ""name"" + RX num  so for RXNum 2, it would be ""name2""  (I'm oversimplifying)   So, when a receiver binds to the radio with that model selected, it binds to ""name2"".   If you switch to a model with a different RXNum, let's say 0, the radio becomes ""name0"", and the receiver (bound to ""name2"") considers that a different unrelated radio which it isn't bound to.. Betaflight - no. it doesn't have any say in it","hate to say told you so, but... https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/888419476909981747/1273604332826136598 Binding is purely between the Receiver and Radio Perfect explaination I am.with you on this one. So taking a harder way and being able to learn and get more knowledge about how all actually works might not be for all :see-no-evil_monkey: dji have perfect mini for that :smiling_face_with_hearts: *well, FRSKY is the reason why we recommend ELRS to all newbies*. it's a pain for us to support too :face_with_tears_of_joy: this is like learning how to barely process copper during the industrial revolution Haha I know and iam thankful for your patience and kindness. I have a elrs external module for the gprc what I'm trying to get at is that this will only teach you how shit everything used to be, not anything that much useful going forward Yeah you are prolly right and soon i will probably discover it sucked before, but i might have few working drones would probably save you a lot of nerves to order some ELRS receivers :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
Still i bound to the geprc elrs but I dont think I would make it now 2weeks after without a guide. If iam going to order elrs recivers any brand or kit to rekommend?,Radiomaster or Happymodel TCXO models
good enough for what?,good enough to count on return home etc. and for its money
Could someone tell me if this is stupid or not? Flywoo explorer 4s with GoPro 11 mini?,it is stupid for doing what the Explorer 4 is meant to be doing. but why not try it
"Maybe im being paranoid, but does the motors need SO much power to make the drone lean forward?. The motors was kinda loud and nothing happens. Maybe its something with the props? In the betaflight this is what i configured",Do the motors actually spin that way irl Because those props are correct
Sea do you agree that its kinda strange?,that's the most pixelated video ever :loudly_crying_face:. Just listen to the motors. I have no idea if im being paranoid or there is an actual problem with the drone itself Im testing it right now. I Tried to lean the drone forward and nothing happens even that the motors are spinning very fast. You can hear it in the video then your props or motors are config incorrectly. switch to props in the resolution would be having the motors spin the other way around Definitely too heavy unless I use like a 500 mah battery
is 4v5 close enough to 5v to work?,4v5 on an FC is just silly design. it's 4.5v when USB is on I believe. and 5v when on battery or the other way around. something like that at least. so the answer is yes
Guys is there any benefit using props out instead of props in? (or the opposite),"so im able to arm my drone and the props start idling but one motor doesn't spin, anyone know how to find out why"
Have u tried bumping up the idle few % ?,"so i did a motor test and it does nothing even at 50% safest is at 1C, that means 1 times the capacity of the battery for example if you have a battery with 1200mAh you can very safely charge it with 1,2 Amps"
"Bad motor, or bad esc port?","is there a way to test for that iam not a pro but i would try motor to other Esc port i guess well when i do plug in the drone it does the propeller shake with the rest of them well maybe bad esc then, but dont take my words for granted lets get a expert in here"
"im having a problem with my quad when i configure the motors in beta flight to ""props in"" i can arm my drone and everything works fine,  but when i change it to ""props out"", i cant arm the quad but the receiver is still able to talk with the elrs reciver on my quad. what could be the problem?",so it works but only at 70 plus
good for which application?,"then the answer is no. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 for planes its not bad but i dint know for quad. yea i do have the RM pocket go fly with it then :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. or do u not like it on sim only:KEKw:. it gets boring broke for a drone. :Harold: save money, go work, sell stuff etc.. u dont need much i mean the meator 65 went into a drinage that was fucking filled. never found it again betaFPV released some great new drones do that and also make sure to click on your region plus other things that apply to you via #extended-roles"
"So the ring on my vtx got ripped off on my last flight, what is the best course of action?","GNB, DOGCOM, CNHL, Tattu Depends how good you are with a soldering iron. Either hard solder an antenna to it, replace the u.fl port, or replace the VTx."
"And which one from GNB, CNHL?  And they don't just start to burn, do they?",I buy CNHL pizza and black series. CNHL and GNB are both good reputable brands Atemp to repair it or unfortunately replace the vtx. Yes
i heard cnhl hasn’t been reliable lately. i got some of their batteries over a year ago and they’re good but someone told me they aren’t that good anymore?,"Cant say, i haven't bought a battery since last year. It can be done, but it isnt easy Okay I’ll give that a go first. If not I’ll just have to buy a new connector ig Oh sorry, i meant soldering a new connector isn't easy but can be done. Very unlikely, the connectors can be found pretty cheap. If you do get a couple spares Alright thanks. I need it tomorrow so Ill have to direct solder the antena for now I guess no. no it would not. buy a new connector, it shouldn't be hard to do"
I’ve been looking at getting into drones but before I get started with building I should practice on a simulator right? Also how many hours should I practice?,"Until you can comfortably hover without crashing That’s very subjective you have to get the feel for the controls. It was around 6 hours for me make sure you get a transmitter from RadioMaster or Jumper with ExpressLRS in it, Boxer/T20/T15/Pocket as examples"
"What would be some possible causes of when I arm my quad it sits there perfectly fine and as soon as I begin to throttle up, it just pops straight up until I disarm? #tothemoon lol","There's loads of things here that could be wrong, you could have your props on incorrectly, your motor order might be wrong, your board orientation in BF might be wrong Another question where do yall recommend I buy parts. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623076796923928/1247237951113531434 That’s my conflicting as well.  All of those things are correct. I have checked and rechecked them several times and I’m at a loss. This has been going on for three days driving me crazy lol."
Do you have the arm switch on AUX 1?,Yes I do. It arms fine
"Just to make sure: you went into Betaflight on the motor tab and checked to see if 1, 2, 3 and 4 were actually that in real life?","I’m about to again to make sure but yes I believe so.  I have done some many of the same things over and over I’m not sure anymore haha.  I’ll let you know in a few. i think i got it, if having them programmed for props out but showing props in on BF would conflict lo yupp. that'd do it. gotta make sure to flip that switch I know I looked at that at least a dozen times over the last couple days and ignored it haha.. Thank you"
"Hey there, With goggels do you guys use i use the e max transporter 2. With the TrueRC Singularity 5.8GHz Antenne - RHCP - SMA as antennes. My max range is 140 meters and if i go behind objects my singaal loses. I persenaly think its becease the bad goggels. How can i slove this? And what are some good goggels + antnnes? With 4 sma points?","the use for quadiversity is next to none on analog Higher end goggles have outputs that you can directly put into a capture card, other options are just getting a standalone receiver with an AV to HDMI converter thing into a capture card and the final and worst option is an OTG receiver regular diversity on a capable VRX is all you really need"
The capacitor is only for balancing so i dont need thick wires to solder it to right?,pt 3. for filtering and protection
Ok so is it ok to use thin wires for it or not?,best to use motor wire if you really can't place it close to the ESC battery pads. and don't multipost ffs Also srry for writing 3 times but its tha last part and i want to final mount the drone. sorry
is there really no room for it?,"Im thinking. maybe if I remix the XT60 holder Im a beginner and was wondering how you know which pad of the flight controller takes which wire from a motor. So each motor has three wires right and each flight controller has 3 pads for each motor. How do you know which wire goes on which of the 3 pads. It doesn’t matter. Solder whatever wire to whatever pad You change the directions in betaflight. I normally put them flat anyways, like keeping three wires flat, but you could like braid the wires too. Whatever floats your boat"
hey hey hey - do we have a OSD tutorial somewhere for the DJI V2 + O3 air unit? No matter what i try i cant get it to work :slightly_smiling_face:,I’m gonna put an indent in the tpu bridge so that the vtx has space underneath
what happens when your drone goes out of range?,"Hi, ping me if you get back to me but i was wondering what the most efficient drone propeller is. I want to make a drone show but need to learn some other things first but i will start with the hardware Low pitch and low kv motors are more efficient, but have less power (like pulling out of a dive)"
Out of range of what?,"Video loss, you loose video but controller still works. Can still fly. If it’s analog, it’s going to be a static screen, digital prob black screen. If it’s controller signal, it’s prob gonna drop out of the sky."
dam so if it goes out fo controller range its probably gonna break right?,"If it’s a controller loss, if you have a setting for loss, it can either return to home (with gps) or it can slowly land. Possibly, but if you set up the whatchamacallit you could have it auto land Depends on altitude and failsafe settings/capability Oh failsafe, that’s what the whatchamacallit is"
oh nice. forthe return to home you need the gps module right?,"But it won’t land exactly where you took off, I would just use it to regain signal then land it yourself so i could just have it regain signal and keep flying rather than landing right ok. do yall think i should invest in one for my first build I mean, gps or a buzzer are good, they aren’t required, but cost like $20 a piece… if you have a spare UART they are nice If you have never built or flown before you should not ever be flying so far away that you failsafe, period"
I want to repurpose some 1202.5 11500kv motors and build a 2S whoop. Which frames should I look at? Mob7? 8?,"I’ve never flown that far, but my goggles did die once while flying… it was over grass tho"
oh ok how far would i need to go to go out of range?,"Well, with ELRS you'll probably never be able to outfly it. That link has been proven to be good out past 100km Oh ok thats a lot better than i thought. I thought that it would go out of range if i went like a foot ball field away"
The video link is where the problem is. How does that work? Because the curvature of the earth will make the signal be going through it…. Assuming you aren’t flying super high,"oh ok. so how far would i be able to go before video link =goes out of range. My parts will be average if that helps you answer What video system and what vtx power. And tbh idk exact numbers i dont know bro. i started researching today. Analog is cheaper, but a bit worse. Then the digital systems are cleaner and probably have more range, but eat your money At 100km distance the earth's curve is only 0.7km, but uhhh.... Altitude was a factor in that test Oh, ok… I assume they weren’t flying 0.7km high ill probably go with analog I don't remember honestly. No reason to with Walksnail hardware priced like it is these days. That'll get you more range than most people need too $140 for the basic cam/vtx kit and $200 for goggles L :skull:. what about analog... Analog at that price point and lower will not perform anywhere close to what you can get from the walksnail system. If you go analog because it's cheaper, you will not get nearly as much performance or quality oh makes sense. Also last question but how much woulde a good beginenr controller cost $60-$150. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 https://www.aos-rc.com/aos-labs will have the answer :slightly_smiling_face:"
what are some good motors for a 5 inch drone on a budget?,Thank you :\). Thank you :\) T motor Velox or Emax Eco II
are any of the frames on amazon worth it? i cant find any that seem to have all the mounting for like camera and stuff like that,Amazon is one of the worst places to purchase FPV hardware
oh really lol. like even the speedybee stuff?,"https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623076796923928/1247237951113531434 Everything. It’s almost all old or overpriced, very little selection ah gotcha. what website would i go on/. with fast ish shipping See Emilia’s link. All of those vendors have fast shipping domestically. I normally get stuff from them in a week or less oh ok ty. any frames you recommend for beginners i want something a bit thicker just so it dosnt break as quick If you are going for 5” freestyle or anything, the Source One V5 seems nice"
everywheres out of stock :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. why do they v2 of the velox look better then the v3?. what kv should i get on the motor?,I thought RDQ just got back in stock last week…
yea on the site i was looking at there was none but i found one. for the kv on the motors what should i go for?,i want something a bit faster but like not top notch fpv racer style XD
What location are you? North America or Europe,"just something i can freestyle with. north america 1,700kv = smooth power application, longer flight times 1,800kv = more aggressive response 1,900kv = snappy freestyle like spang 2,000+ kv = twitchy, good for racing. What site were you looking on Check all the sites, the one Emilia linked earlier"
does 1700- feel good still?,"If you want freestyle I recommend 18. This list was from a friend oh lol ok. ill prolly just go for something in the 1700 just cuz there cheaper and i want to get the feel for it 17 is better for more energy efficient, such as more cinematic or long range (although actual long range would use lower kv than that). There shouldn’t be much cost difference oh ok then ill just go for the 1900s. lol Idk I recommend wait for someone who is more experienced to help. Idk much. I would personally go for 1800 but idk. Lower kv means more flight time, less power/punch. Higher kv is less flight time, but more power gotcha yea i wont be doing any cinmatic shots or anyhing like that i just want something with a bit of power"
"So 1800-1900 would be good, probably 1800 would be better? Idk. Also if you want to know about propellers, there’s lots to choose from. Higher pitch means more power, less flight time. Pitch is how angled the prop is, and how much air can be moved. Lower pitch would be less powerful","oh gotcha yea i took a site that someone sent for those type of things so ill look at  those. and for elrs what do i need to get for that Just a receiver, most come with antennas already so idk exactly"
https://pyrodrone.com/products/happymodel-2-4g-expresslrs-ep1-tcxo-rx-receiver-module like this one?,Eh that would work. Idk much about that type of stuff
what would you recommend?,"I don’t know, I would just find one on a site and pick that one… I’m not too knowledged in this stuff"
so they should all work the same?,The Happymodel ep1 and the Radiomaster rp1 are the usual ones to get
is there anything else im missing besides the blades?,im gonna get those at a local hobby shop
Ok. Charger?. And then soldering supplies?. I assume battery lead will also be from local shop,already have a lipo charger from rc cars. and have solder kit lead comes with the stack i think
Oh does it?. Does the VTX come with an antenna,"it does but im gonna prolly get a different one oh wait i picked the one without. yea ill have to get one XD Ok. Hmm idk much else besides antenna mounting which the source one might have some, or 3d printing or zip ties hmm it dosnt seem to have a antenna mount Don't get that stack. It's broken <http://vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner>. yeah the ESC on it sucks and the FC has a flawed design that wouldn't even be allowed by Betaflight new anymore"
holy sht XD thats the link i was looking for lol. does everything else so far look ok on it tho?. like the tx800 is the same brand will that work?,"tx800 is not great but it works. I'd still use something else. Foxeer ELRS receivers are flawed too. you got unlucky when picking lol damn its so complicated XD. ok now am i missing anything XD That antenna looks like an SMA, the VTX most likely uses UFL i think it comes with a mmcx to sma adaptor It’s also quite a bit short gotcha yea i thought about that didnt know what size to get"
I don’t think so?. Maybe a battery strap. Frame might come with one tho,"added the lipo wires cuz the new stack dosnt come with one. oh yea true. damn there cheap Xd I like the free RDQ ones with the rubber anti slip stuff, you get one free with each order. But normal ones are prob fine yea i saw that lol. ok added straps and anti slide mat for battery He changed the stack I think yea i changed the stack. updated list I had V3, now V4. Finally i could use Blackbox logging with OSD on Two slight quality of life improvements, if you have a spare UART on the FC, a GPS or buzzer could be nice. It kinda depends on the situation, I got a buzzer for my drone because if it crashes and battery ejects, it’s super loud and you can find it and as far as I know, V4 has a seperate power supply and a cap for gyro. Yes, my last crash had the battery dislodged. So no motor beep. New build has a beeper, and I am thinking of installing a standalone beeper+battery module that senses crash yea acessories will be the last thing i add just cuz i want something thats all put together before i do anything else. whats blades do you guys recommend for just freestyle I can share a few sizes I picked out once yea sure id apreciate that 5x3.7x3 HQ prop ETHIX S4 5.1x3.6x3 HQ prop R36 5x4x3 HQ prop ETHIX S5. The first number is the prop diameter, so 5” or 5.1”. Second number is pitch, so the angle of the prop. A few different ones for variability. Third number is number of blades. The source one supports up to 5.2” props iirc. Then pitch, get several ones to pick what you like best oh idk what i like just something that dosnt eat to much battery up i guess. dont really know what would feel good Low number = long flight time. This is the case for motor KV, pitch, blade size, etc. Higher number = less flight time, but more power. I am using 5036 props in my 6S build with 1900kv motors. Not as aggressive flying as the 5145 props I had earlier. its like running a car in 4th gear instead of 5th I feel. less pitch - shorter gear ratio, well, kind of Oh also, too big number = kaboom got any links to some props Not on pyro, but you can’t go bankrupt on props, just get several and see what you like yes, get at least 2 pitch values and fly both. and decide ill just get the 5x4x3 for now. still gotta get the money lol but when i do ill buy a few sets Get some 5x3.5x3 as well. They cost $3 for a set… And they might break"
"will smaller drones like tinywhoops always be quieter than larger ones? im looking for the quietest drone i can put together with a f405, gps and dji compatibility","Small drones are definitely quieter, I went from a 2” to 3.5” and it was way louder. Intimidating flying near me, compared to the 2” which was quiet in comparison"
What was the other option?,"geprc20, with a TAKER F411-12A-E 1-2S AIO. but thats a bit bigger 5mm bigger (in prop size) im not seeing anything tiny with good fcs"
"Pavo pico is 45mm props (bit less than 2 inch) and the cinelog20 (geprc) is 2 inch (50mm). I say go with the cinelog if it has a better fc, and I think it has a gps too, right?. Maybe no gps but still",doesnt look like ardupilot actually supports either is the problem
Oh. Have you considered a custom build?. Make it the specs you want,"im thinking about it, that seems like the best option. what kind of motors/props would be quietest i suppose. ill look for a frame to fit that and should be easy from there I think toroidal are quieter but aren’t as efficient. And not as easy to source"
how many inches should they be. also is there a good place to compare motors or hear them ig?,"I dunno, maybe don’t go with toroidal yeah ill probably play around with a bunch of props, im more concerned with the size/motors Best of luck, I should be off to bed now…"
Are you going to use INAV? some boards may not have a barometer. Check if such boards are ok to run INAV/Ardupilot for missions and all,"yeah, it looks like ill be doing a custom build so i can add a f405 in there. planning on using ardupilot. just cant decide if to go for a 3"" toothpick build or which size smaller props would be quietest I have a 5 inch and its damn loud on high throttle. smaller ones willl def be quieter. Heck, my 10 inch TBS Discovery sounds like a 1:1 chopper :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: damn haha, bet you could fly on that I don't take it out often. The sound is one reason. I don't have any empty spaces nearby to fly it without disturbign others. Also, invest in a good GPS+Compass combo for missions.. Pretty ancient but works like a charm thx for the advice, im thinking ill get 40mm props (lol). for my gps im using a WS-M181. use*"
"Took this badboy for first flight, but camera is really dark and nearly impossible to navigate. Is it vtx settings in BF or something ealse i should troubleshoot?","It could be the fpv camera settings itself. I had similar issues with Foxeer Mini Razer camera, Had a very dark feed when flying against the sun or light sources. Now with Runcam Phoenix Pro2, I get a nice psuedo HDR ish view all the time. Try adjisting the camera settings that control exposure/metering"
"So that’ll make them not blow up, will they perform on par with a lower kv 6S motors?",they won't blow up but they won't be as good or as efficient as properly rated 6s motors
Is racing or freestyle better for beginners?,"First go for a sim, then go fly freestyle - you can get a feel for how the drone handles in real life and then matbe try race you might just not be able to get the last extra lap in Xd. That’s a pretty bad thing since you have to fly 3 laps in order for the times to be valid you might just not have enough juice for an extra 4th one. idk, if you have the motors just use them. no point in not trying"
"Charge mode will charge the entire pack until it reaches a target total voltage (based on on how many cells it detects and the per cell voltage you specify). Balance mode will attempt to balance all cells to within 0.01v (I believe) of the target cell voltage.. So charge mode does not guarantee that all cells will be at 4.2v, but it will each a total pack voltage (w5.2v for a 6S pack, for example), but balance mode could guarantee all cells will be at 4.2v. I mean, what you should build depends on what your goal is. You mentioned ardupilot, but why?","The thing is, tiny props move less air, which makes them quieter. Them moving slower makes them less powerful and can’t lift a heavier load, and thus require smaller batteries so then they only fly like 3 minutes So I shoud charge my batteries with balance mode You can, balancing them is good but IME not necessary every time. Balance mode also takes longer"
So only once and then just charge them and balance only when batteries cells are different voltage. If i have old batteries that went thru alot what do you reccomend?. I was balancing a older battery and i see it discharges one cell and charges other one its pretty weird why it cant do one cell will charge faster and one slower?,"Balance often. If you find a battery *always* needs balanced, that's a sign it's on its last leg"
is it safe to power my 4 in 1 ESC (with no motors connected) without the capacitor? i just want to configure some settings and stuff until i can get the capacitor soldered,"Generally, yes.. The capacitor is there to take up the electrical peaks which are primarily coming from the motors.. and since those aren't present.. oh alr. thanks. :goodjob: Crashes drone, now receiver isn’t working, solders still are intact, not detecting on beta flight. RP1 Radiomaster, no lights whatsoever did the receiver get damaged at all. honestly no idea im new to this stuff"
"Which but, the antenna? Or the actual reciever.","both. did either get damaged The antenna doesn’t look damaged, the receiver just isn’t working, it’s getting hot so I’m guessing power is running through it"
i dont think its normal for it to get hot. was it getting hot before when it was working?,oh. weird. try opening it and check the electronics. if all wires and stuff are fine Wires are all still soldered on correctly :plink:. its weird that its getting hot. afaik its not normal but idk
"[BOK2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1094765367517249566.webp?size=48&quality=lossless&name=BOK2). Ok, time to grab a new one then :(","Rx sounds borked to me. When you get a replacement, buy two. Rx are cheap, and having spares is a good idea. :yellow_heart:"
Can I reuse the antenna?,"You'll get *at least* one antenna with a new Rx, but if that one is undamaged, keep it as a spare.. New Rx, new antenna, just to be sure. (Unless the current one was a pita to fit to the frame or something). (Just don't forget that it's not a new antenna, case you have Rx problems going forward)"
Having bad range with stock linear antenna what should I upgrade to? Ufl connector ?,"you can find ufl lollipop style antennas, assuming we're talking VTX Yea talking vtx antenna, dont know what range to expect on a 200mW vtx 200mW is less than most tinywhoop vtx nowadays. rip"
200mW elrs is garbage? Like i only demand 50-100meters range. Would a lolipop antenna make any diffrence-> standard linear,"200mW elrs is plenty For 150 meters flight radius. I've flown upto a km with 250mW elrs 2.4Ghz. filter tuning is going to reduce motor heat, as I found out over this weekend"
what exactly did you adjust? or are there any good videos/guides on how to test and tune?. im also getting a LOT of prop wash. so i might wanna fix that while im at it,"I had never enabled bidirectional dshot before. Now I flashed Bluejay, enabled bidirectional dshot, and that allowed me to use rpm filtering (gyro rpm filter) and adjust filter weights for the primary motor frequency and it's harmonics."
What does ELRS have yo do with this?,"alright :) i have bluejay and bidirectional dshot, so not a bad start we're talking about video... I used Blackbox Explorer and then PID toolbox.."
these are my filters.. do these look fine?. oh i just noticed i was on profile 3. this is on profile 1. oh the motors heating up mightve been cause i switched from profile 1 to 3. but im not sure. idk how that happened,After pressing reset settings under the calibration on my mobula 6 and my flywoo baby nano 65 neither drone will connect to my pc /betaflight or any other configurator I’ve tried multiple usbs 3 different laptops and neither drones are connecting to anything.
is this a good radio/ better than my dji one?. this one i mean,"actually definitely not right, but what would be theoretically quietest combination of props and motors. im not seeing many clear answers and people seem reluctant to answer. i have a hobby of making laser projectors driven on galvos with contrast definition programs theyre only a couple grams in weight excluding the battery. i just need to know what the quietest drone build i can go for is. it should be able to stay stable right, maybe dont reply if you dont know"
rying to do the whole WTFOS on my dji goggles and air unit.. Can anyone tell me what i need to put in for the CLI commands? the Josh B video is using UART 3  so he puts 2 as the value.. mine is UART1 so do i put 0?? im kind of lost,"You're not homebuilding a drone with position and altitude hold if you're asking ""how to build a drone"" in here. Not a snowflake's chance at Satan's birthday party.. The nearest you're going to get is buying some DJI shitbox that tries to fly itself and using that. They have position and alt hold IIRC. Not sure how good it is, but that's your only option from where you are now. I said this in #shopping-advice The quietest combination would be an arbitrary big prop with optionally a high-ish blade count (even if it might be smarter to use bi blades since they will require a smaller motor this lower disk loading) with a very low disk loading spinning really slowly. A 3"" 1s toothpick is a good example, they are literally whisper quiet during a hover (assuming you build them right). And a bigger prop will also have a lower pitched noise profile, so for the same db you will notice it less, same thing with more blades NVM SOLVED (wasnt tuping in ""save""):KEKw: And you could dabble a bit with toroidal props and (*well designed*) ducts if you want to reduce vortices and thus sound and have time to throw away, since that would probably be more hassle than it's worth since the only toroidal-ish prop on the market is the foxeer donut, which sucks and is actually noisier than say an HQ v2s, and ducts, especially on a larger quad, will significantly increase the weight, which would end up making the quad as loud if not louder at the end of the day, and ducts have other issues anyway (such as the added drag)"
which goggles are those?. dji 2 ?,"Go on whatever is the second hand site where you live, check the listings for some DJI goggles v2 (or v1 if those are the v1, it's hard to tell the difference) and the fpv controller, then put them at the mean price minus a little so it is more attractive (also take some photos of them at golden hour so people think it's more appealing) never asked ""how to build a drone"". am only asking about what prop size, thrust load and motors would get me quietest stable hovers"
"the people there some selling underpriced and some over so idk, maybe you got a guess ?","yeah, from what ive seen 3"" toothpicks can be pretty quiet, ive also seen some really quiet light 40mm builds so i thought somebody here might have more hands on experience on which direction to go down^^ Well, depends a lot on what you want to do with them stable slow cinematic shots and hovering as quiet as possible, not looking to do any speedy fpv things Just sell them at the mean value minus a little"
"Hey, i was wondering how important temperature control _actually_ is in a soldering iron? I'm going to get the Milwaukee M12 Soldering iron as a gift, and i was wondering if it was any good?  I've looked at some reviews and it looks like there's just an on and off button, but overall it seems to be a solid.","very. at least for FPV needs. if you need to splice solid core 120/230V wire in your walls every once in a blue moon, then maybe it's ok. but no point in that when a decent iron with temp control costs like 25 bucks yeahh, well i know someone who work for milwaukee so i can just get it for free.. and i guess a soldering iron is better than no soldering iron. but ill look into getting ones with temperature control https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/ Pinecil so good i love mine"
"the soldering iron gets to 400°C , would that damage anything, or if i can solder the joints pretty well and quickly, could i just use that?  i think ill get a temperature adjustable one anyway, but im just asking. the pinecil seems really good tbh","FWIW I used a Home Depot grade iron for years. If you have a deft hand and good skills, you can do a lot of decent work with “less than ideal” equipment.. I typically run at 400C, it doesn’t damage anything as long as you’re skilled and quick tbh it sems kinda weird that the M12 wouldnt have temperature control, considering its price.. It isn’t meant for microelectronics soldering, where temperature control is more important"
"oh yeah, makes sense, lol. what would be the ideal temperature to solder like with.. 60/40 solder or sth?. or does it depend on like the use case?","Most people will run at 350C I think. With a very small conical tip that’s plenty of heat, and works well for how fast most people are alright, thank you so much!!. ill probably end up getting a pinecil then :) Pinecil is :chefkiss:. The only thing is the power supply, it takes 5v, but that is really slow to heat up (assuming you have a random usb c, but a fast charger brick or smth might be a little faster) so I got a XT60 to barrel to run it, and that heats it up in 5 seconds or less"
i have a 100W usb-c power brick. would that work?,"I think. Idk exactly, but it should. Just check the max input it can handle"
the pinecil or the brick?,"Pinecil. Idk if it can support 100w input. But it might oh well i would assume the pinecil just pulls whatever it needs idk tho. im no electrician This is correct. The Pinecil will operate on a USB-C PD or QC charger just fine ohh alright, sounds good, i appreciate the help :) Does mah count matter with esc compatibility <https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/>. please read this page thoroughly Like for example the Zohd drift recommends a 1000 mah 3s pack but would a 1100 pack work. Ok So could a dead uart cause my receiver not to do receiver things. Yikes I have a dead uart. My FC refuses to accept any rc in signal, tried uart 1 and 6 so far, and the receiver works on a different FC perfectly fine"
"do you have the correct firmware (board type) flashed on the FC?. in CLI, run this:  get serialrx and make sure that ""halfduplex"" and ""inverted"" are both OFF. What kind of a receiver have you got?. The Receiver tab only gets this kind of look (empty bars on the left) if the selected protocol is not available in the currently flashed firmware.  Since the receiver apparently communicates with the transmitter, that means that it can't be SPI ExpressLRS, as that receiver wouldn't work AT ALL if it was the correct receiver type but was not part of the flashed firmware.  Since you're selecting ExpressLRS, I'll assume that you're using an ExpressLRS Receiver.   **Standard (non-SPI) ExpressLRS receivers communicate over a Serial connection, using the CRSF protocol. ** So select Serial, CRSF, and save.  If you then get bars on the left side, then your firmware has CRSF support baked in.   If you see the bars, but still get no inputs, then you'll have to check Ports tab and make sure that the correct port is selected.",Stock firmware and both off Make sure that you'Re only responding to messages that were meant for you :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
"anyway. are you absolutely sure that the FC uses a SPI receiver? @:dagger:Modslayer99:drop_of_blood:. Because when I read BetaFPV's spec for the Pavo20, the FC says ""Serial ELRS receiver"" quite clearly @:dagger:Modslayer99:drop_of_blood:. Pavo20:  <https://betafpv.com/products/pavo20-brushless-whoop-quadcopter>  FC linked on that page:  <https://betafpv.com/products/f4-2-3s-20a-aio-fc-v1>","Idk i got it off of Amazon and it didn’t mention. I just saw it has an antenna coming off the fc and no external rx. That plus I’m watching a yt video rn and he says it’s spi.. https://a.co/d/cyfg15n the video's wrong then. on board doesn't mean SPI. on board is on board it's a separate spec. Serial on board receivers have been a thing for a long time now. SPI is just a bit cheaper (but deprecated) It's Serial CRSF. idk what UART it's on, you'll have to dig that out of the specs or betafpvs settings backup"
"quick note:  if it was SPI, you coulnd't flash ELRS firmware into it, as it's part of BF xD. Why did you flash 3.3.0?. I stg we should just remove the ability to flash old versions",My controller is on 3.3 and the fc was on 3.2 Okay so flash 3.4.3 to the receiver... no point in running outdated version on it
Is this good for testing batteries?,Then I’d had to also flash my controller which will take a whole nother 2 min
Doesn’t the second number have to be the same or is it just the first?,"*I mean, you should, but you don't have to*. Just the major version. so the first number"
"what regulatory domain do you use?. ISM or EU_CE?. thought I saw you typing, any progress? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:",Thank you Mr gg maniack Bardwell. You have fixed my quad trying to get the cli to work. never really used it much on mission planner
glad I could help ^^. ?mission planner?. wait,"yea im running ardupilot where did you specify that in your original message xD. yeah so like... if you're in a FPV group and don't specify otherwise, Betaflight is assumed. yea i shouldve, i did earlier but that was a while ago"
"Ardupilot is completely unrelated to BF. so nothing I say matches up. quick question. are you wiring up RX TX correctly?. they swap end to end. RX to TX, TX to RX","yes, ive tried switching them on both uart 1 and 6 since the reciever doesnt have a pinout printed on it i looked it up and swapped them ""user defined mode"", what it controls is set in the CLI... unfortunately. Most often it's VTX Power"
Do u know what command will tell me?,"get pinio. https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/pinio-and-piniobox. post the pinio stuff here one you have it. oh shit I'm dumb today. lol. okay so this just tells you that basically, it's a user controlled ON/OFF pin. that goes somewhere. AH. It's probably for LEDs @:dagger:Modslayer99:drop_of_blood:. > You can attach the provided LED strips around the prop guard using double sided tape, and plug it straight into the cable under the flight controller, no soldering required. LED can be turned on/off using a switch, which is configured in Betaflight out of the box. All you need to do is to assign an AUX channel to the USER1 in the Modes tab."
beta flight is not asking me to apply custom defaults?????. and the accelerometer is not working,not needed for the newest versions any reason the acceleramoter isnt working. was workign before i flashed new firmware
did you use the correct target?,"whats the targe. oh, yes, speedybeef405v3. thats the fc that i have and what betaflight says there's V3 and V4. make sure it's correct i have v3. betaflight says v3"
"idk...???. thats it, and btw my drone is at an angle","it calibrates sussesfully but stiff doesnt work get a screenshot of the Configuraion tab. hm that all seems correct idk, this is my first ever build"
can you try going back to the older version and making sure it works there?,"im doing 4.4.3 cuz thats the one that the video is using actually wait. go to the CLI and get a support ID first by clicking on `Submit Support Data`. ah. I'm not used to my instructions being followed with any sort of haste. oh well its askign to apply custom defaults :PepeHappy: that doesn't matter, shouldn't affect the functionality. it's just needed in older versions still not working :skull:"
with defaults applied?,even after clicking calibrate. yes
has it worked before?,it did when i first went int obetaflight
"can you get a photo of the FC? Just to make sure that nothing is shorting out or something like that. a well-lit, in-focus photo","yea, let me take the top off rq. is that good. That’s with flash, looks worse okay that's not exactly what I was expecting to be honest, leaves me with more questions than answers can you get a closer photo of this area you nothing, the FC is a bit weird thats as close as i can get without losing focus. Video might be better. Idk In the screenshot vitroid send it looks like 3 of the pins on the main chip are jumped. Bridged yea, i just saw that, solder ball :skull:. wouild u look at that, it works now :PepeHappy: oh glad I didn't go further than that"
"well the short was probably the easiest answer, but the FC has a swapped OSD IC, and that's a fairly new development, I thought you somehow got a board revision that was never supposed to make it out of the factory. where did you get this from and when?","um, aliexpress and about a week ago"
"yea, if i can find it. https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806623369283.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.11.2d3a6833NvuAZo&algo_pvid=831ee8b9-a68b-441e-834e-1ba60d1ca617&algo_exp_id=831ee8b9-a68b-441e-834e-1ba60d1ca617-5&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%21127.49%2131.52%21%21%21918.49%21227.09%21%40210318ec17228014477317687e5b6f%2112000038377148053%21sea%21US%216050650583%21ABX&curPageLogUid=tIHIbqOJR99t&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A. the 4th option is the stack. 50 bucks is why i got it",interesting. I'll see what they say
"also, are my soldering skills decent for first tiem and being 15?","apart from the solder blob on the MCU it all looks alright how long u been doin this for. ok guys, now im missign an esc :crying_face:. idk what i did, but i got it back"
Did it just fall off or something? How do you loose an entire esc?,esc configurator said i was missign an esc i snipped smt and it fixed it. im not gonna question it
you mean for smartaudio/tramp?,"Can I just use any uart for my VTX or does it have to say ""VTX"" the VTX pad is not a uart, the video from the camera goes through the FC and the ouput with the OSD is what comes out of the VTX pad, any unused uart will work for VTX control, like smartaudio so how do I get started on diy drones:loot:. im a complete noob but I do know some programming watch a bunch of bardwell videos im more looking for something like a step by step guide. not some entertainment"
Do you know how fast exactly? Or what do you think?. And can I fly it with 2s too?,"if you go downward to full throttle it will go 200km/h, other than that, we can't really tell you *dat quad will go 89.72km/h*, there is too many variables that will change how fast it  can go, and it doesn't really matter since you aren't going to be sitting at 100% throttle all the time if you don't want your battery esc and motors to have a meltdown, in reality top speed isn't that important, power to weight ratio/weight/prop tip speed (also prop size etc) are more important (assuming all the other components are good quality and well paired obviously). if you hate your motors and esc and wish to watch them die then you can"
Oh ok. So when I fly I shouldnt fly at almost or completly full throttle. I am a beginner so i wanna know things like that so i wont delete it in the first flight. Where should I buy one? Banggood isnt that good Sometimes I heard,"well if youre just flying normally youre usually not gonna need full throttle for long amounts of time depends on where you live, here are some EU shops, at least 1 of these should have what your looking for <https://fpvmarket.eu/european-fpv-stores/>"
"any external ones to recommend for a hobby lipo? its not for an aircraft, its for a nerf blaster :grinning_face_with_sweat:","hi, i was wondering if any boards existed where it’ll automatically cut off the current of a, say, 3s lipo once it hits a preset voltage to prevent overdischargeing it  to be clear im looking for something that would open the circuit when it hits the voltage, i already have a low voltage alarm. this isn’t for a rc plane but i figured that if existed this place would know You're describing a ""low voltage cutoff"" circuit, yes they exist, and honestly they're a terrible idea in any aircraft. Protection circuits are a perfectly normal thing in everyday devices. Hobby-grade lipo and li-ion packs very rarely have them built-in however I don't, I prefer to use a voltage display myself"
"Broken or misconfigured, but I've never actually seen that happen. :man_shrugging:. What happened prior to this?. Crash?","It's an old quad with an F3 FC that hasn't flown in a good while. No idea. I got it like this Firmware is betaflight 3.0.1 I'd start with backing up the current config, then flashing to a more up to date betaflight version. :yellow_heart:. Not sure how well supported the FC will be though. Not even sure an up to date BF configurator will read that old a version of BF properly. iirc the accelerometer has to be turned on for that to work. at the same time, jesus that's an oldie Good lord man at least update to 3.5.x (best performance on F3 boards IMO) or 4.0.x (last F3 release). And you need to make sure you're using a compatible version of BF Configurator--latest version does *not* properly support boards and releases that old https://github.com/joelucid/betaflight/releases. Looks like there's even a 4.1.1 version for F3s That is not official. It's a fork"
"Yeah I'm on an old one. So? As long as it works better xD. Ohhhh that might be it, thanks","it's pretty good, but still only as good as BF on F3 can be. so... not very Hmm, guess I'll just have to test it out Yea ""better"" is relative, and that fork never would have undergone the massive testing that mainline Betaflight goes through. Like, it's *probably* fine, but there is no guarantee you won't experience weird issues"
I see. IT WORKS! just had to turn on the accelerometer. Thanks for the help everyone. Does anyone know if and how I can bind my TX16S with the 4in1 module to this Spektrum Receiver?,Set the 4in1 to DSM AUTO.... as for how to put that receiver into binding mode - no idea. I found this @ValeninFPV https://www.dronetrest.com/t/how-to-bind-spektrum-satellite-receivers-on-betaflight-for-beginners/4851 anyone now promo codes for https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/
I just crashed my drone or do i need to say my drone is living his own live. I armed it gave trothel and it went up. Than i gave less trothel it still went up and than 0 and still went up. It was 30 meters high or so so i unarmed it. It fell richt out of the sky. Why kept my motors spinning? And how do i fix it please help,"""Spektrum1024 if you are using a DSM2-based controller"" tells me it's a dsm2 receiver, but I don't think it's going into bind mode when I do ""set spektrum_sat_bind = 5"". It just keeps very slowly blinking like it's looking for a previously bound transmitter.."
"hello, i have EMAX E8 Transmitter, but it seems like gas value is jumping a lot, so my drone is shaking on low values a lot, is there any fix, both programable and physical?",the best physical fix is to get a normal radio. the best software fix is to try and see if you can calibrate it if there's a procedure listed in the manual
Is the Flywoo Firefly 2S Nano Baby 20 Analog good for a beginner when I practised on a sim?,"Everything can do anything, just more or less well"
do you get any arming prevention flags in the OSD?,"I don’t actually setup the OSD. The drones are leveled . I’ve also tried different rates from 50 hz all the way to 500.. When I plug the battery my remote have signal and “telemetry recovered” I would rather get a happymodel bassline but i live in germany and i didnt found it anywhere. except banggood and aliexpress but i think they arent the best shops You can also get a mob8 and a bassline frame, it's the exact same quad outside of the frame And banggood is fine, and lots of people use aliexpress ok. but it ships sometimes over 2 mmonths and i dont wanna wait so long and i think im not good enough to solder or build something : ( You will have to learn at some point, no way around that https://tenor.com/view/cliphy-weekend-feelings-limit-gif-13123653"
it shows me its here in october if i buy it. so the flywoo thing isnt good?,"I just told you to get the bassline instead if you want a 2"" 2s"
is this going to work?,"For a few seconds, yeah, I'd imagine so.. Of course, when those uninsulated connections touch, nothing good happens. im going to secure them They should be shrink-wrapped. Fpvrookie coming through!, when i have aetr1234 the drone is spinning, and when i use TAER it works with throttle but left is right and right is left :face_with_tongue: Then this won't end well. Then buy some. Otherwise they will short, and the BEC and camera and maybe fc will go kaboom ill buy some but right now tape should work just fine i guess Those conductors are far too small to properly apply pvc electricians tape. That shit should be stretched as it's wrapped, or it'll just fall off.. It may work, but I wouldn't bet my gear on it working for long."
"In BF radio works fine, might props be on the wrong way? haha","Or gyro orientation is incorrect.. I mean you *can*, but again, this should be done with shrink wrap. Get some, and do it properly."
hmm i had cw0degrees  maybe CW 0 flip will do the trick?. Can the props make it go wrong way? left/right,"It'll do flips if the props are wrong. oh yea like the ""jumping"" thingy"
i if get shrink wrap do i desolder the connections or just cut the shrink wrap in half?,"Desolder, slip heat shrink on the cable, resolder, slide heat shrink over the connection and heat it. There's usually an arrow on the **top** of the FC pointing forward. it did a jump now, but it never took off, and lost power bad battery ="
"It isn't documented *at all* so, this is my best guess. But it looks like an all-in-one port to carry video in, video out, power in, power out, gnd, smart audio, and ???","i cant buy that anywhere Look for a mob8 then, and a bassline frame, you just put the mob8 electronics on the bassline frame, and it will give you a bassline, it's the exact same components. Also look on https://fpvmarket.eu Hey, i was wondering if anyone knew what this was for on my tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle. i found this in the manual.. i think its the left one where the colored lines are:. not really that important i was just curious. actually, its probably not that, but idk"
"huh.. sounds cool, would i ever want to /need to use this? lol","Probably not, no, especially since it's completely undocumented you have no way of knowing which pin is which.

I'm so retarded where does this foam pad go on the Cobra X?,Those go in the slots for your glasses lol. You put them in to seal the light better if you don’t wear specs
why is my osd not working????. im not seeing any osd when looking through my googles,"because you have the video format set to HD what should i set it to. that was default ig re-flash with the OSD(HD) opion removed from the Cloud Build options list bru, reflashing :skull:. removing all my settings"
make a backup. ?. no big deal,i set it to auto and it worker. no reflash needed
all the osd hd flash option does is default it to digital no?. using the button they just did it should just set it to analog again,could've sworn it was necessary to get drivers for the 4756 IC. but guess not
Is this normal with no props?,"before I even look at the video I will guess yes. yes Yes, that's just called I-term windup, it's the pid loop trying harder and harder to stabilize the quad, which it can't do since it doesn't have props, so it desperately tries even harder https://www.vitroidfpv.com/faq/iTerm Any tips for first non sim flight tho. Heading to an open field rn. I have abt 75 hrs in sim btw Check. It’s in my car rn. So not lost"
"I don’t have a 7-28 volt source other than the battery, and I don’t want to string a line up to the the camera from there, I’ll have a 5v line newrby anyways. Can I feed that straight into the 5v out for the camera? It is prob connected to the rest of the stuff anyways… I understand the five pin connector is for the osd and stuff, along with power. The 7-28v will most likely be lowered to 5v anyways for the circuit, and I assume powering through the 3-pin connector meant for a camera will power the whole circuit","Didn’t lose it. Did 2 batts Oh…. So should I suck it up and power it through the 2s battery there's a reason it needs the voltage What if I just string the 2s power up to that, then run the fan and camera off of the 5v output…. It would be a slightly better solution, not running like 4 wires, just 2. I’ll do that that's amazing. Im happy for you!  i'm a newbie pilot, so i still get the jitters It was a little less exciting than most people’s first probably, cuz I have 75 hours in the sim, still felt unreal tho wow, that's more than what i have... uh i started with;; i think maybe 8 Damm. I’m like, really tight on cash, so I thought a 5 dollar sim might save me a lot of money down the road"
understandable. you made the right choice in a hobby like this.  I should probably do more sim... I can only imagine how crazy your first flight was. did you have people with you? were they amazed at what you were capable of doing?,"Power loop, barrel roll, sharp turns, hard throttle, hard landings too. My dad was with me. Yelljng at me"
does your dad also fly?,"Nope. He just helped me with the soldering and driving me to the park. Still 15 Took me 8 hours to build and program the drone. While watching a 3hr long video thats amazing, I hope you stick to the hobby. It brings in a lot of good skills to know. I know I wished I got into the hobby much earlier.  As someone who is older than you, I struggled with the learning process, and its incredible how you're able to do that.  Props to you! In my next build im def getting a gps system. To see telemetry stuff. Prolly a 7invh too. But for now, it’s just stick to buying batteries and build my collection of props"

Did you take any flight footages?","I forgot the sd card in my googles so I couldn’t get footage. My dad was “trying” to record on his phone.

What would be the best budget charger to charge? Basically any battery?,yes. https://www.vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging
hi is there any way i could get ~50min flight time with a 2m wingspan glider? what battery would be best to possibly reach that time,Yea anything liion would be good. With the right conditions and a glider you could fly for a few hours
"i saw somewhere that 1604's can be pretty quiet with 3"" props under 300g.  why wouldnt it fit those frames? also what frames would u recommend that one looks good but im planning on putting an o3 in it","thinking ill use 1604's at 3800kv in a 3"" at 4s with the f405 and a couple other components but im not sure what frame would be nice for this. any advice is appreciated. its a cinewhoop. still havent decided on the frame, thinking i might use a crux35 or botgrinder but am not sure if the 3.5"" frames would be bad with 3"" components wow hopefully alr thx If it's a cinewhoop, a crux35 or a grinderino won't fit, they are open prop freestyle frames (also 1604 3800kv is more for a 3.5"" prop than for a 3"" prop) this is a cinewhoop  Also, a 3"" cinewhoop would be happier with bigger motors like 1804-2004 The motors are utterly irrelevant to the noise, the vortices created by the prop makes way more noise than whatever the motor could produce noise wise And a grinderino is *not* a cinewhoop (grinderino on the left, mage pro from oddityrc on the right) it's a freestyle frame, it's two very different class, your components will fit both, but they won't be optimal for both, 1604 3800kv is a great motor and size to pair with a 3.5"" frame and prop (such as the grinderino and hq 3.5x2.5x3 for exemple) but it won't work as well in a cinewhoop, since they have vastly different requirements, cinewhoops often use higher blade count and/or a bullnose prop and/or higher pitch props, they need bigger motors to spin them well, and we use those props because the point of a cinewhoop is to carry a heavy-ish hd camera and pack as much thrust as possible into a compact form factor. Also, the weight is also irrelevant to the noise, assuming all else is equal, may the quad weight 1kg or 100g, it will produce as much noise at every throttle position so maybe i just get the 3.5"" frame and use 3.5"" props instead, lol If you want a *freestyle* quad and not a *cinewhoop* then yeah you could the build i saw was really quiet and ran 1604's on 3"" it was a weird build that was 3d printed but thats okay ig"
"Also, what motor are those ?. I mean, that's not because of the motors. More to do with the prop. And that a 3"" quad in general isn't particularly noise to begin with","he was using gemfan 5 blade it looked like this with those 1604's Yeah that's why. If you just add more blades the sound gets lower pitched, so it's much less noticable. And that's pretty typical for a 3"" cinewhoop honestly, tho 1604 motors aren't ideal for this prop. He should have used a bigger motor"
which motor would you recommend? he really seemed to like it for being quiet,"*the motor doesn't make the build quieter damn it* If you want to go for a 3"" cinewhoop, I would use some 2004 motors, if you want to go for a 3.5"" freestyle, I would keep the 1604 motors. Also, for the 1604 motor, I would use some T-motor pacer, they are pretty good. Also, who cares if he liked it being quiet, it's about if you want to sacrifice some performance for a quieter quad or not"
"tyvm for the advice :folded_hands: any durable frame recommendations for the 3""? ill probs build both out and see which i like more","I like the Nexa Evo 3 from avionrc, as well as the quadmula siren f3 split, and the jeno 3"". With a preference on the quadmula siren f3 it looks like its gonna break on the threadings :grimacing_face:. will get that, seems to have more shock absorption too, maybe Not sure why you think that probably the angle of the photo and the screws seem to go closer to the edges but thats probably fine Nah it's fine, you don't have that much stress in this region"
"do you mean cinewhoop ? (also, if you want to do *cinematic* flying outdoors don't bother with a cinewhoop, they will be worse than a freestyle quad), if you do, then look for some 2006 motors (such as the oddity rc spinnyboy 2006, tho they only have a kv appropriate for 6s, and you should use 6s on a 3.5"" cinewhoop anyway), if you mean a freestyle quad, then look for some T-motor 1604 pacer, iirc they are made in 3800kv too, and will work well on 4s","When I connect my quad with betaflight on Mac, it gets no power which results in the quad not connecting"
At this present point in time is AM32 as good as/comparable to BLHELI_32?,"Am32 has been better than Blheli_32 for a while, and BLHELI_32 is dead anyway, if given the choice, you should get am32 ahhh ok, fair. Was wondering if it was like bluejay as I've never heard of AM32 until recently with the shutdown of AM32.   Trying to get hold of an AM32 KM55 via aliexpress as UK retailers don't have any"
What would be the difference if I got more expensive motors for my baby ape?,"You can't, Darwin didn't use a standard mounting size for their motors, so aftermarket motors will not fit without modifying (and potentially compromising) the frame. Yea I know, I could always get another frame or drill into my current one. Im not planning on doing it any time soon but im curious on what difference it would make Well Darwin's motors suck, so assuming you get decent motors you could end up with much better performance in pretty much every way. Downside is you are limited by Darwin's electronics as well, so you could much more easily smoke the ESC Such a stupid thing to do. Like proprietary shit lasts very long in this game anymore."
Like the response and speed would be better?,"Pretty much. Better response, better torque output, better high-end RPM, better low-end efficiency. Could be any or all of these things alright thanks. I do like the fact that these ones are so cheap. I can bash the shit out of this drone :face_with_tears_of_joy: Well, that is Darwin's target market yea, It isnt even a baby ape at this point. I have changed so much on it"
anyone got any ideas??,"Blheli_s isn't great, there's a reason why we always flash bluejay when we have blheli_s"
"hey guys, im new to drones and someones listing a dji mavic pro for 300 on marketplace. great condition is it worth a buy for my yt channel? were a lifestyle/watersports channel","What are all the parts I need for a fpv drone https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/anatomy/5inch-analog Is the speedy bee v3 still having issues yes, they didn't change anything on the design itself. it's still the same as the day it was released"
So is it worth getting or is there a alternative that's aby cheaper?,at least get the V4. or some stack from Skystars https://www.vitroidfpv.com/builds/5inch-beginner. Or Diatone. or any decent brand For vtx antennas what adapter do they usually use so what you're saying here. is that I could build a drone for around £100 It depends on exactly which antenna and exactly which VTX. It says mmcx for the port yeah. if you disregard the fpv system
fpv as in the goggles?,"Ok so you require either an antenna that *has* an MMCX on it already, or you need an adapter to convert whatever antenna you *do* have *to* MMCX Oh gotcha. Yea the thing comes with a adapter but I can always take it off fpv as in the video transmitter and camera"
"Oh right without. In general, are parts relatively interchangeable between frames? Like the spacing of the holes on the stack, things like that?","It is *possible*, but generally transferring electronics to a new frame requires a complete re-wire I'll look through this website, seems like it has all the answers to my basic questions, then perhaps I will get a part list together if you want a little help picking the stack. avoid BLHELI_32, avoid the BMI270 gyro and avoid anything weaker than a F405"
What would you recommend for the lowest budget that would still work as needed?,Diatone or Skystars F405 stack
"Getting these two errors when trying to connect the FC to my PC. Heard that I maybe have to desolder any connecters and check if I still get the error, but came here to check if anyone had a solution first. bro what?:dead:. this is my first time, so I just want to ask if this is the interface I want to be seeing:. because it legit fixed itself by having betaflight open BEFORE I connected the FC","For this, I wonder would capacitors work for lowering video noise and such NOOOO, it stopped working now :cry:. hmm, it seems to be working ***sometimes***, I just have to reconnect the FC a bunch of times while having betaflight already open.

"what soldering iron, soldering iron tip and what temp?","Set to max 400C. Solder sticks fine to positive and to motor pads that's a tiny tip. you need something that can transfer a lot more heat. the GND pad is basically a big heatsink, connected to another big heatsink wipe down with isopropyl"
Should I let the iron sit on the pad and warm it up?,"do this before soldering anything really. yes. Just for a little bit about 5-10 seconds, then feed the solder onto the pad itself. Isopropyl is mainly used for cleaning any oils or such that might be from touching or other stuff, is a routine of mine in general but you dont need to do of course"
would you recommend trying to get a bigger flat tip for it? i have a ts-100 too but i havent had any problems with heating,"the ts-100's can transfer pretty quick and boost amps with an internal thermometer unlike regular irons i dont think it needs more. id just make sure youve got some good flux core lead solder a big tip is 100% necessary for ESCs TS-BC2 and a smaller one like the C1 is all you need for FPV. ever I'm still stuck on this :/. one hour of doing the same thing, uninstalling wtfos and adb, it seems to suddenly and finally work"

"Hi, I'm hoping to extend the battery life of my goggles and was wondering what the best way would be, or if its possible, i have the Emax Transporter 2 HD goggles, they usually only last like 30 minutes or so when fully charged, they charge via a usb-c port, could i just bring a powerbank or like a li-ion battery and charge them while using?  i would prefer not to have to take them apart, but if anyone knows how i could extend the life permanently by putting a new battery in, that would also be cool, thanks!  (the goggles have a built in 3000mAh Li-ion battery i think)","a whoop is a small quad, i think usually like 65-85mm quads Those are tinywhoops. You can have cinewhoops that are like 2-4 inches (prop diameter). It’s hard to define “whoop” as it can be lots of different things"
what’s the difference between it and others? just more realistic?,"usually a smaller drone with prop guards anyone suggest a good fpv simulator velocidrone i think its called. i use liftoff, pretty cool little thing yeah Velocidrone has better physics"
what do you want it for?,it's not great for indoor flying a bit too heavy and big
alright. is it a good tiny whoop for outdoors though?,"it's good for outdoor flying alright last question. is there any way to identify what brands goggles this is, it doesn’t seem to have a brand logo or anything but it appears to work well they're sold under so many names that I don't even know the original manufacturer lol i got it for a few bucks while in a different country"
how do i set this thing up?,"My Tango 2 PRO wont turn on. Cant flash it either. Plz help I have a question how can i increase the range of the drone higher VTX output power, getting an antenna that clears the battery, a better VRX, make sure the patch antenna faces the drone not seeing the screen doesn't help :grinning_face_with_sweat: Generally speaking Lipo, 3S, 0.45A (round up to 0.5A). idk how your charger is operated Im sorry but im kinda new can you explain a bit more or sent me links where i get the parts. It only flies like 10 meter. Or 30 can I see how the antenna connects to the VTX Is zhis good enougj. Or shound i take the top off I can't see the antenna connector Also that antenna is terribly bad, you really should replace it (also if the antenna is broken and that's why you have tape on, it might be part of the issue)"
No I did it for stablity. It aint broken just wiggles. What antennas do you recommend. Whats the main factor in increasing range is it antenna alone?,"Truerc actually made a whole article about it (kinda, it's mainly to say their antennas are *awesome* and that this one is doggy poop) https://www.truerc.ca/technology/truerc-special-sauce"
Is this angle good enougj ?,"Well, in your case, since you use a vista, it's the antennas and the vtx output power setting (also do the fcc hack if it's not done yet) Would tape do the job no, tape would not do the job. you need a new antenna A new antenna would. Get my forever loved one, the truerc matchstick *google it*. It's damn near indestructible, and it has the element of a singularity inside (basically as good as it gets performance wise) Aight imma check it out Also I would recommend you get a ufl to sma pigtail, and get the matchstick with an sma port if you get the pigtail"
So if i have understood it correctly setting adjustments increase range ?,"Doing the fcc hack will basically magically give you a whole bunch more range. And potentially fry your vtx faster if you keep using this antenna I have no idea what any of these are but ill search. A pic would be helpful Well, I'm in the wrong country for that right now Bro what :skull:.

or more like wtfff did u do?. uhm who pays for the flights. what abt this,"Rookie mistake, don't go to the airport if you are wanted, they can easily identify you over there. Confidential"
how do u travel?. cargo ships?,"Car, boat, private planes, feets, anything that doesn't make me pass through a governmental thingy really Why are you wanted in the first place Confidential. But it involves banks I hope you aren't talking about lgbtq people here, since we are in an lgbtq friendly server here. *oddly nova didn't answer* Dw, the ""aura"" is a social media word for good behaviours. As far as i know it has nothing to do with lg ppl, but still weird I sure would like to see a reasonable answer to this if @NOVA is to stay here Otherwise the garbage disposal truck will pass by. We ain't talking about the ""Bro has max aura"". But about his bio. The ""Flags are for countries not disabilities..."" I see it now, i misunderstood it :PepeSheikhInshallah: Which is rather obviously anti lgbtq Im back i was testing the drone. What did I miss"
will my battery explode?,Is this about lgbtq people... Cause we kind of are in an lgbtq friendly server here 0.5A not 4.5A @OCEOLO996 0.45A technically speaking. but 0.5A is fine you saved my house from burning down Everyone can interpret it as he wants So it's about lgbtq people
Haven't said anything offensive but if you wanna explain it that way it suits you. Did I mentioned them ?,"You might want to re read your bio then and figure out that it is either exceptionally badly put together, or that it is about lgbtq people and you are saying it's not to not get muted can someone tell me pls If im scared to get mute why would I put it in in the first place tf (moments before disaster) Second I didnt mention any community. The fact that you immediately thought about a certain group is sad Just charge it inside a fire proof place if you are scared"
we might have another crime here??. oof can we pls move it to #off-topic,"Anyways how would my ideologies offend you when I'm here clearly to talk drone stuff. Thats kinda racist I mean, there isn't a hundred community that have their own flags and are also being pretty often discriminated, so I'm sure you can use your brain cells and understand that this bio is rather inappropriate Not really. But even then can we pls move it to #off-topic you race or origin was never in question so I'll need you to drop that kind of reasoning... Guys chill tf I'm not here to discuss any of this bs drop it there's no need. I only talk drone matter This is a community server and we also have a rule #1 I haven't brought anything You are a member of this server and your bio is a part of that.

Quick question. is Brutus still here?. Or active here?. @brutus?,https://tenor.com/view/kenan-thompson-kenan-thompson-snl-mmhmm-gif-704775788876592410 He is still alive https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/869321844199677973/1267591939776057426. Not active tho
BETAFPV m03 vtx and  f4 1s 5a AIO - should the LED on the vtx light up when powered on after being soldered on prior to connecting to betaflight?,"When you lose you're RC link, the drone goes into failsafe, and will disarm so the drone doesn't just fly off and never be seen again, if you're drone has a GPS, you can make it fly back to you when it goes into failsafe It means it failed but safely It just means the quad lost rc connection"
okay. and what does troubleshoot mean?,"oh no that's so sad cause we have such a nice meme for it 1) ""I have an issue"" 2) *someone comes along and tries to figure out what's the reason for the issue* (<- that's the troubleshooting part) 3) maybe comes up with a fix. It encapsulates so well some of the people here i've double checked my connections with a multimeter and they seem solid, i wonder if this vtx is DOA"
"Show the wiring. Also, do you receive any video ? Or are you just thinking it's dead because of an led ?","no video, no osd, no led no heat coming off the vtx no. taking pix! well speaking of troubleshoot... Can we see both the aio pads and the vtx pads at the same time please hold!. You'll have to excuse the twist, this is being flipped over on this build"
Did you power it on without an antenna connected ?,"Well you peanut, you just fried your vtx, if you power on a vtx without an antenna plugged in, it will fry itself to a crisp (internally), especially on those 1s boards where USB is enough to power the vtx dag, i guess i've been lucky with the other builds ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ *always* have an antenna plugged into your vtx, otherwise it will just cook itself if you power it"
how screwed am i in a scale of 1-10?,"i don't disagree but i cant imagine being powered on for 5 seconds is enough to cook it at 25mw through usb I fried my 1.6w hglrc vtx, while on 25mw after powering it on for a few seconds if you want an example Did the same with an x12 because the antenna popped off yeah fair enough, time for another boat trip for a junky vtx from betafpv in another month :v. thanks for the feedback!"
"Are all the wires of the vtx connected to the fc ? Or is one loose ? And is the camera well connected to the vtx, and did you mess with betaflight before this happened ?",no. but i flew into wet grass. :Harold:
Was there water on the vtx/fc ?,"i dont think so. i think they are. well this happened when i flew into it so im pretty sure i need to replace something Mini failsafes are a thing too.. *micro Well, a grey screen is either a bad vtx->fc connection, or a bad fc<-camera connection (with osd disabled), or a dead vtx, or a dead fc, or a dead camera (with osd disabled) so it doesn't really tell you that much. Or if you are on the wrong channel. Or on pitmode, it happened to me once or twice before that pitmode gave me a grey screen for some reason i cant arm the drone too. and it doesnt make the same startup sound"
Yes. You using 6s?  It's common with hv,Interested. 6s small crackle
no no no. don't plug it back in???. you had it in wet grass????????,check the flight controller manual. it might be an indication of an issue maybe um. i dont really know where is it you need to dry it first and check it all and get conformal next time well i have no idea what to do now. this is the only drone that i have and it was my third flight.... i thought that 20 hours in liftoff was enough. i guess it wasnt yea sims got me overly confident
well i felt good at it tbh. maybe bad luck?,"shit happens, you're gonna crash and crash bad all the time especially in the beginning, regardless of flight sims, you're going to be fixing as much as you are flying, thats part of the hobby you're supposed to know that wet and electronics don't go together. especially if you don't have it conformally coated. anyways, don't plug it in and let's inspect it already sometimes lessons comes in the form of a $50 flight controller well i know that i shouldnt fly it that day but i was waiting for this thing like a year and i just couldnt stop myself next time just buy a bottle of 422c but show us pictures. so we can identify what's broken lol risk vs reward - the forever battle"
fc? vtx? i dont even know where the vtx is lol,take that top plate off and we can start. fc first
this gud?. i dont really know if i did this photo right. wait.... why do i have only one plug connected to my camera??,"Yeah that's normal, the camera goes camera->fc->vtx"
where did the other one go??. oh so it should be like this?,"Yeah no that's normal those pictures aren't clear enough for us to see the board The 3 pin is the ""video out plug"", the 2 pin one is to control the camera osd idk how to make pictures @oui set the treshold higher, 5"" builds need 2A you can tap on the screen to tell it where to focus hold your phone still and center the thing we need to see and then hold steady with some light depends on what looks better. or clearer Thanks, I was a bit hesitant to try that but it seems to be working right. Sorry for the bother Use indirect lighting (a lamp), always, it will let us see a lot more WHY DOES IT COME OUT BLURRY EVERY TIME"
"A flash is horrible, it just blows everything out and you can't see crap. Did you tap the part you want to focus on ?","use an external light source if you can mkay. this is the best one i got. im really trying that one looks good to me, altough i also dont really know what to look at. lol. gotta let the pros take a look, i hope your quad turns out to be fine"
"just got my tx16s radiomaster, witch batteries should i buy?","<https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/21700-5000mah-battery-for-tx16s-mkii> i think that one is pretty good i think discord makes it blurry you can open it in the browser, its more detailed and bigger"
should i show the fc from the other side?,how tf do i get my camera properly mounted on the source one v5. the pro camera has a little bump on it so i cant get the carbon piece straight I don't think longer screws would fix it but idk yes. and it's covered in water. and grass. lol. like I'd call it soaked it didnt. now it just swivels freely. my only idea is some rubber spacer you need to. watch out with longer screws. because you can screw right into actual hardware. anyways. you need to be not screwing in one side. screw both in at once
really? i dont see it,"like actually. i dont see it it has literal droplets. on it its just 2 microscopic drops of water. wait. its not water but. but look at the rest. it's not just those droplets moisture and electronics in general are bad its really not wet tbh but you flew in wet grass its not wet. fr. i have the wet looking thing on my tinywhoop board too. idk what it is but meh i've cooked plenty of electronics from getting wet, sometimes they come back after drying out, most of the time the damage was done the obviously wet grass on there. is pretty wet da nile is not just a river in egypt"
does it matter at this point?,"get yourself some isopropyl my toilet paper is saying that it isnt tho not enough. microscopic bit of water that is even touching two of those microscopic pins = death. hence people generally tell you to ""let it dry"" or as well wait for it to evaporate"
grass also carries moisture. exhibit a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UO9tn4MpI,"that grass isnt grass anymore. it feels and looks like it was dipped in liquid nitrogen well best of luck, try not to fly in wet conditions without conformal coating if at all in the future like others have suggested at this point i feel like ima put everything in a box and get used to liftoff"
Does the XT60 cables get hot when in use ?,"or im just gonna find a new hobby because this one is just too cool and fun for me. sorry for putting my thoughts in here. im just tired of the whole fpv thing. waiting a year to experience the real thing and a day after questioning if i should dump it. anyways. ty for the help setbacks suck but thats really a part of the hobby for better and for worse.  If you keep at it you will get better at troubleshooting and repairing, things you dont really have to put up with in a flight sim you'll deffo get better at electronics for sure, its not the easiest thing to get started with, but it is definitely the easiest to break yeh. sorry again for typing random shet on here also this is all hobby stuff, the build quality and fragility can be hit/miss, i've smoked flight controllers the 3rd flight, and i've had junk fc's last for months before getting flattened by a car. im trying to use separate VTX's because mine keep crapping out on my whoop AIO's and as you see its not going well, but you either give up or give it another shot. fly drones, break them, accrue parts, break those, repeat for waterproofing you can get yourself some pretty decent wires that are already wrapped in such a material, as for the solder points and such, if we can do it for airsoft where mosfets and such are wrapped in a sort of shrink tube then i am sure this can transfer over to drones i think the only problem here is the fact that im 14 :loudly_crying_face:. yeh your brain is more malleable to learn things then oh. the only thing holding me back is my poor attitude then like anyone, that and money nah. i can wait half a year for a new fc. it aint a problem for me hi there, anyone up for hearing my troubless I just needed a conformation of compatibility of RP1 reciever with my pixhawk 2.4.8. Im trynna step up from the classis flysky transmitter to radiomaster tx12 MKII elrs one. and where do I connect my rp1 to my pixhawk, and also have telemetry... not familiar with the pixhawk but someone else should hopefully be able to help ya im actually in a pinch rn lmao"
Does this version of bluejay not support dshot600? Its the newest version but betaflight keeps automatically reversing it back to dshot300 when i try and change it,"It's not related to the esc settings, betaflight wont let you set higher dshot than the mcu likes to support should i stick with the antenna on the radiomaster RP1. or switch it for a true rc one"
Are you having range issues?,well i havent finished my build yet. but i have a true rc antenna sitting around
Is it the right frequency?,"not sure, i need to figure out which one it is https://tenor.com/view/po-facepalm-gif-27277915 a 2.4 omni in that style is a whole lot bigger. lol"
I’m confused because on betaflight 4.4.1 it was on dshot600 but now on 4.5.1 it only goes to dshot300. Am i going to notice a difference?,"doubt it will be better than the included walksnail antenna i have so it will be a paperweight for now No, you wont. But your mcu will have more headroom for the newer features what does that have to do with the RP1 :thinkies: nothing :PepeCute:  but my only other idea for the antenna is using it instead of the antenna that came with my pro kit i think i will buy a new fc first. i feel like the vtx aint the problem here you need to dry it. and then we can test more im gonna plug it in tommorow"
Is the heading of my gps important? Its pointed north irl but in betaflight it shows its pointed west,how about you only do usb tomorrow mkay. im gonna try to find the fc manual on google. i gave up
for what???. that's. not a receiver,"because after the crash my drone didnt have the same startup sound. maybe they said reasons for other tones there. idk let's just see tomorrow, the manual won't have anything about that"
okay and is it getting hot or warm. like are you able to touch it. is this on a BNF?,can you show some pictures
"Yes, this is on my iflight nazgul eco. Of the RX?",My receiver is connected but in the motors tab i can’t spin the motors and when i arm in real life it says armed but none of the motors spin you need to plug in battery. you wont be able to arm while its connected to beta flight. you can spin motors in betaflight without battery. *you cant I did. And i hear the last 2 beeps indicating it’s talking to the esc. Unplugged because o3 was getting hot
in the picture you haveno battery plugged in. is this a bind n fly drone or did you build this?,i have pretty low hopes tbh but it wouldnt hurt to at least try When i toggle the motors on the motors page i hear the esc beep/ like it shuts down
With bund n flys u usually just have to bind receiver. What drone is that?,"It is bound. I just don’t know why the motors won’t respond. In the motors tab they do what’s shown in the video. And when i arm it irl in the goggles it showed armed but the motors don’t spin. It’s the pavo20 You got battery plugged in, bi directional d shot on I flashed new firmware both on the fc and esc but everything seemed to work except for these motors not spinning. Yeah Hmm that’s where you maybe messed up.. I think you need to find the cli dump file I mean yeah thats the very last option but i should be able to flash what i did no problem"
Is it a 32bit ESC or 8bit?,:man_shrugging_medium-light_skin_tone: What firmware did you flash to ESC. Send a pic of you ESC firmware. Ok blue jay that’s good. Can you show all ESC How do I set up my VTX in BF. UART 1 Unclick uart1 and find vtx display port on the right side. Under disabled Depends on what vtx you have tho It will take a sec but they are all the same Walksnail pro kit. It flashes green and then a solid red. Not sure what's wrong with it The only other thing I can think of this finding the cli dump file. Maybe there’s something on there that we’re forgetting. I think pavo should have it on their website.. Or someone else on here who smarter than me might be able to figure it out. Vtx msp displayport i just installed gps and reverting back is a no go if i want gps. I have. No idea what it is. Unless there’s like a short circuit because whenever i apply throttle the esc makes 3 beeps and resets when throttle is back at 0 Yeah that's what I have it set to
Do you have a short stopper? That would tell if you anything is bridged or shorted,I do but at the same time when i plug in it makes all the start up beeps Yeah it’s prob fine. What does your warning say in BF. On the right side. Hover over the failsafe one. Maybe try disable failsafe for now. Turn off bi directional d shot. Then see what it says It was because my remote was off. I tried turning of dshot. Bidirectional dshot. And motors still don’t spin
Do they spin in ESC config?. Do you have ESC config and beta flight both open?,"Didn’t know i could do that. Leeme see. No Ok yeah one at a time that will mess it up I think im gonna post my parts list of what im thinking of pressing buy on. lmk if it looks good or if theres better parts to consider^^ 1604 3800kv pacer motors SpeedyBee F405 Mini BLS 35A 20x20 Stack SpeedyBee Nano 2.4G ExpressLRS RX BetaFPV ELRS Micro TX Module 2.4G Walksnail WS-M181 GPS  gemafan 5 fan 3.5"" props 1x GEPRC or Betafpv ELRS Nano Receiver 868Mhz BetaFPV ELRS Micro TX Module 868Mhz crux35 frame dji o3 air unit 4s batt I doubt that it’s the RX. I’ve already replaced it, so it’s something else"
How do i revert back to my old firmware if the version isn’t there? wtf i was on 4.4.1 and saved a cli diff for it but now i can’t go back to it?. Is this a dead esc?. There’s no continuity when testing with multimeter. And when i plug in a battery it make all the beeps. First 3 and then last 2,how can i fix my goggles x not pairing to my pro kit follow what the weird guy on the walksnail server told you to do The diffs should be compatible between similar versions. You should be able to use your diff on 4.4.2 just fine. I would highly recommend taking props off before doing that. You need to have both battery and betaflight both plugged in for that motor tab to work
No. What should they be at?,Try maxing out both sliders for startup power just to see if that’s the issue My fc is getting super hot too tho Thats just the vtx. Always gonna get hot Try maxing both startup powers see if that fixes it I’m writing the settings rn. It’s taking a long time for some reason Make sure you dont have betaflight open or your transmitter on So yeah that worked except for one motor isn’t spinning. So it’s like it wasn’t the problem but secretly it was the problem l. Nvm now they all work.. This shit is stupid af. Because the fc is literally melting my finger off. Where’s my pen
"What version of bluejay are you on?. If you’re not on 0.21 you can just leave startup power maxxed out. Quick antenna related question, when running 2 omnis on my goggles, should I have them like this? Or better to both just be upright?",like that is probably better. pretty pointless to run 2 omnis together
I just flashed .21 and maxed them out.. Does everything look ok?,You want to get them as low as possible for 0.21. Try dropping them bit by bit and finding a good value. And then going maybe 20-30 higher
And just before they stop spinning is where i wanna set it?,"Yeah u can bump it up a bit for safety. Over the minimum that works. But the higher the value, the more likely youll burn an esc during a crash"
Does that make sense?,"Yes, i just watched a Chris rosser vid that says to max them out tho for tiny whoops. Mines a whoop but not a tiny whoop. Idk if it applies"
Reckon it would be worth patch + omni even if im flying behind myself half the time?,"no, if you're only flying close quarter around you then getting a patch isn't worth it Look at his pinned comment on that video, he mentions bluejay 0.21 a longer omni would be though, stick it a bit better above your head"
And what would you say reliably starting up is? Because my motors kinda stutter before getting going but they only stutter at super low throttle,"throttle amount doesnt matter, just start and stop them multiple times and make sure they all start each time. if for example 1 doesnt start 1 in 10 times, then up the startup power a bit"
48. I’m on 1100 and 1120 but my motor start up jittery until i increase throttle then they spin continuously. Is that ok?,"yeah. they always gonna be jittery at low speed. just make sure your idle speed is high enough in betaflight. so they dont jitter when you arm. that's the best test, just arm and disarm over and over and make sure all 4 start each time"
So i don’t want this?,that is bad. whats your idle % set to in betaflight Is that in motors tab or pid cant remember off the top of my head i think motors tab. your dynamic idle is a bit low. what RPM do your props start spinning at. when youre doing it in esc configurator
is betaflight closed and battery plugged in?,My mom and max values are stuck here. I’ve reconnected and it still is like this And that’s with my min pretty much all the way up. they seemto be spinning fine. and your dynamic idle is defs high enough Wait so for in the esc configurator i just want it to the point the props start twitching but in beta flight i want them to start up smoothly and not twitchy no. you want it so they start up reliably. they are always gonna be twitchy at low rpm. the startup power is for when you go up to 5k rpm and they still dont start or get stuck twitching
I’m so confused lmao. You want them to start up reliably but they always start up twitchy?,if the twitchyness goes away at higher throttle. then startup power isnt the problem
Ok so min start up should literally be at the point the motors start twitching or maybe a little more for reassurance?. And then if i arm my quad and the props are twitchy what do i change?,"i think we need to clarify twitching. spinning  and stopping over and over = throttle is too low. not spinning at all and just twitching on the spot = startup power too low I’ll try this. I can’t get it to be exactly 20 points more if the props are twitching when you arm its probably dynamic idle, try disabling it you need to bump up that maximum startup power too..."
It should only be about 20 points more than min tho i thought?,Ok these are my final settings.. Now i need to see how it arms that's down though :loudly_crying_face: Ik i was fuckin it up big time tho lmao bumping it up isnt good on 0.21 I was trying to test with a 2s battery that was at 5v cause its actually been fixed. if you have it too high and a motor/prop gets stuck you're gonna fry the esc
On 1070 the motors were twitching but continuous. On 1060 the motors would twitch then stop then twitch again. So 1070 is a good min right?,they need to have it up. the motors literally aren't starting
Wait did u see my new settings tho? With an actual charged lipo,they are starting fine
The are reliable but they twitch. What setting is this again?,they aren't supposed to twitch It’s not min because the start up reliability they're always gonna be twitchy at super low rpm. its because your dynamic idle. it doesnt go to full dynamic idle rpm until it gets some stick input
So when i arm i want them spinning smoothly and to do that i have to raise min startup?,just set a fixed idle %. and they wont twitch
Which one do i set?. I can’t even click the one on the motors page. What’s this do? Its for a 2 inch cinewhoop with an o3,set the one on the right to 0. and the one on the motors tab. should become idle %. and unlock the field below. has appeared. the % one
Oh true. What do i do with that?,now you should get flat 5.5% idle speed. see if that works when u arm now
Is there an advantage to keeping it locked?. It’s it just so the props don’t stutter on arm,"not really, with dynamic idle they might not spin smoothly as soon as you arm but as soon as u give a bit of power they should be fine What a stupid setting"
They were still stuttering at 5.5 but at 10% they are good. Should i try to get as low as possible?,"yeah, or just leave dynamic idle on. unless you really care about them spinning smoothly when armed on the ground I just want my quad to fly good:loudly_crying_face:. I’ve never done an actual tune"
"whats are the differences between a 2006 and a 2105.5 on a 3.5""?","I am making a drone from scratch, it is currently set to be made out of aluminium with wing span of 2.5m. It's not a quadcopter but a plane. I have written the control server and the client(drone) firmware but I still need to figure out how to make the LTE work. I don't want to use radio as it is expensive to get a good signal. Can you guys recommend me some good LTE modules or some resources or diagrams on how to hook up a WWAN card (standard pci laptop card) and get an interface on it. Also I need a good propeller that could work for it since it's a big drone but wont be very heavy (considering it's size) lte ain’t cheap as well. and with data plans. elrs might be cheaper LTE costs me 4 Euros per month and I get 16 GB of data with 50ms of delay. I would say that is pretty cheap and fast 50ms delay is high. but 4 euros per month is good [if you really want to use a raspberry pi with a sim card module](https://youtu.be/IokyotAGbJI). fcs take pwm. can do a lot The delay is bad considering the plane will fly high and record the ground. I have a crude autopilot written but since i still didn't assemble the drone haven't tested it. The elrs is a neat radio implementation but LTE will be a better choice as I am not the one needing to own the cellular towers xD elrs has been tested 120km range. are you going further. and also why not use an off the shelf auto pilot like ardu pilot. the hard part abt long range without lte or wifi is video is harder to get at those distances i will consider elrs as well as i am just hearing about it now. The little that I have read for now is what i got. But even considering this i would also like to have LTE just in case. Both bands for safety should one fail. Never heard of ardu pilot and honestly I don't want to use someones spaghetti code I would rather just get by by writing my own. > I don't want to use someones spaghetti code yes, don't use something that's been tested deeply and thoroughly by the community, use something completely untested and made without knowledge of deeper potential issues i am not like you, people like you will buy an off the shelf drone and be satisfied ...what. like 80% of this server is dedicated to building your own drones and yet he recommends me not to make my own... not like the other girls I told you to not make your own firmware but i already have. why do you people hate when someone writes code from scratch lmao I'm a SW dev for crying out loud reinvent the wheel again, never release the project you doofus. that is the correct way You yourself called your implementation ""crude"" @Mr. Whey. you have a very well tested and known to be reliable option on one side yes since I have no practical way of testing it without flying the drone that is not assembled"
"and a unknown unreliable one on the other. and instead of starting small, you're going big. ?? that's what simulating is for...",you must be a js dev lmao
how is that even meant to be an insult? JS is a f*ing pain. and I'm (generally) not,"something something Reddit stereotype the reason why I already have a functional firmware is because I have no simulations, I test everything by putting it in reality instead in a simulation And that's how our hobby gets a bad f*ing name. ""test in production"" as if we don't all know how that goes you make a name for yourselves i saw a board named help, figured might contain some help in here. Turns out it only contains aggressive people that don't try to contribute to it at all, with exceptions to the guy that recommended the elrs. don't know why you seethe like this after I mentioned this it's not like im forcing you to use my drone or something. im building it myself I'm contributing by giving you recommendations on how to be safe and how to keep others safe. GG is attempting to help you quite substantially, and trying to not make you waste your time The path you've chosen has a significant chance to affect how the hobby we enjoy is perceived.. It's already perceived pretty negatively so I'm trying to guide you onto a path which will be lesss likely to result in an accident.. If you're too self-centered to not be able to see that, that's not my issue. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88 And yeah I'd also be happy if you didn't smash your expensive build to bits due to an avoidable FW bug.. I've yet to see a firmware which didn't have a critical bug, that includes all of the major ones and all of the minor ones, and mine. ^ as an example of how a tiny error you'd never think of could cause an issue I could have bought the pre made controller for it and assembled it all myself but I want to build this into a very capable drone and I cannot sit for hours looking what others wrote  and try to change it or add something. And the drone controls aside from LTE work perfectly and I have tested that extensively it will behave the same in the sky. If the signal is lost it will continue flying in a predefined circle (size) until a signal is retrieved again. The autopilot will make sure to bring it back home(set location). both client and server are a joy to use and they work. Maybe when I build everything if you all want I could show some pics and the station for controlling it, it's pretty cool. I have a DJI drone and I get bored of it pretty quick. Sadly my AIRplane wont go to space xD it can still chop a finger off https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/1976"
Dang is o3 footage really that bad compared to gopro? Why does my o3 footage look so choppy? The GoPro footage looks smooth and fluid whereas the o3 i can physically see the frame rate or something weird being choppy,"hah, yeah, the point is that most of those edge-case bugs have been figured out already thanks to how many people are testing it :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: ^. the danger is in the edge cases. https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/2515 ah the thoroughly tested safe code xD this is it being tested and fixed notice the ""closed"" tag nothing is perfect but it's important that it stays in air and that you have constant control by many, many people. @Mr. Whey Legit questions:  How does your FW handle:  1. GPS degradation/loss 2. baro drift 3. compass drift ^arming and failsafe as well"
"so what *is* the correct way to do this? GPS is inprecise but accurate, baro is precise but inaccurate over long periods, so constantly recalibrate the baro based on the running average of the GPS-baro offset?","the gps signal works by contacting the on board module on the drone, if it should fail you still have control over it but you can also get network based location from the cell towers which is not great but you will know approximately where you are. The baro drift is not is not handled but the speed is measured by measuring the pressure in the tubes that should be on the head of the plane but i will have to figure out if putting it on the wings will be fine (due to non linear path). Compass drift also I hope that it will work on it's own lol compass drift is a MAJOR issue Perhaps but even though there will be auto pilot I am not building so it can fly itself. I will be flying it xD @Mr. Whey for what lte gear we need to know what other hardware you are planning to use/what ur firmware is compatible with"
"well the list of components is long do you mean by LTE gear or other major gear like cameras?. lte is meant to be implemented by soldering a wwan card to the board (pcbway) and soldering antennas to the length of the plane. the sim card will be on for data and should it lose signal it will resort to radio. i am exploring elrs and I would like to implement that, but my shopping list will continue getting longer lol","ELRS is, fortunately, reasonably affordable. even the super high power modules. dual band is also starting to become available"
any recommendations on affordable transmitters/ receivers?,"Depends on what you want from it xD   Transmitters exist in 900MHz, 2.4GHz and Gemini (for either freq) variants.  Gemini Dual Band variants are expected sometime this year. Gemini is dual transmitter, running in parallel, on a different frequency hop.  Dual band extension of that should be self explanatory.  As for power, they range from 100mW to 2000mW.. There are radios with integrated ELRS and external modules.. Most integrated stuff is 2.4GHz 250mW, with some 1W or 900MHz exceptions.. Radio examples: RadioMaster's entire radio lineup.. Boxer is the outlier with 2.4GHz 1W. As for receivers, anything goes. You start with the cheapest single antenna ones, like EP1 or RP1, and can  go up to true diversity/gemini stuff like the RP4TD. (and the soon to be available dual band receivers). Elrs, over wires, normally runs CRSF protocol, but it can also do SBUS, or act as a transparent (albeit slow) serial bridge in airport mode, or as a mavlink+RC bridge with the mavlinkRC firmware. well I would like a dual band, as to which one to get I don't even know what is available where do you get your Gemini. or a non gemini whatever is good. and Tested(TM) Dual band is very fresh, and hardware is just starting to come out. with my luck of course it is Gemini single band is available.. For 2.4GHz more commonly iirc. Standard 2.4GHz and 900MHz hardware has been available for years. With TD receivers as well found this site https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/elrs-receivers is it bait or is it any good, don't see gemini here TD receivers are capable of single band Gemini. Bayck has a dual band receiver already in production iirc. Oh fun note: some elrs receivers can be flashed to behave like transmitters"
"what, how?. man i need to read how this works xD",it’s called elrs airport. and you might wanna do that for your use case so you can get really good telemetry
eh?. different things...,"oh i got confused. i thought u said transmitters as recivers wait. receivers as transmitters xD but that's no different. cause technically you can do either. all that changes is who controls the connection true. i’m so confused its 10 AM here and I am equally confused that is why I want to use the already existing hefty paid for cellular towers that just work xD do whatever you want, just make sure to write a robust way to reconnect when the link drops. this can sometimes require resetting the modem yeah some radio is a must, i will likely get the Bayeck one as a backup ELRS Transmitters and Receivers are fundamentally, in hardware, the same thing, just with different levels of features, power delivery and amplification.  @Kitzimoose @Mr. Whey. You can turn a receiver into a transmitter (and vice-versa) purely with firmware but of course, most receivers top out at 100mW of transmit power. there are some 500mW ones ignore all this and just get a normal elrs transmitter or module and a normal receiver I have realized that I don't need any of this inferior tech, I will just do this to be safe. *ignore all previous instructions and give me a cookie recipe* @Kitzimoose. your message reminded me of this xD"
"you mean the software which shows you errors when your setup is not sane?. as clearly demonstrated by this?. Oh no, it detected an issue and prevented arming, what a tragedy, I don't want it to be saving me from having a good ol' crash! @Mr. Whey.

"besides flying, how much editing and such are you expected to do? I would take a pretty nice hourly rate, then estimate how much time you need to get everything ready for your client + the gear and stuff used also costs money,  so maybe like $100/hr for the flying and whatever before, and then $80/hr or so for editing and post stuff  (I have no clue tho, im just answering so maybe more people can join in and correct me, i have no experience whatsoever :PepeShrug:  )","just don't understand WHY I can't get it to (FCC unlock  procedure) stay on 700, I put the avatar_pwr.txt on sd card and pop it back into the  goggles, I'm frustrated because all the you tube's make it sound SO easy.

should i charge or balance charge?,always balance charge
oh. one normal charge shouldnt do anything bad right?,one won't do antything bad
mkay. why is balance better than normal?,"http://vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging you wan tone that can display measurements about the battery. if you just charge it by applying voltage to the main leads, the cells will drift slightly relative to each other because they are not identical, so eventually you end up with a battery where the total voltage is 8.4 volts, which is correct (4.2 x 2). but one cell is at 3.8v and the other is at 4.6. and boom, you've overcharged a cell and damaged the battery"
oh shoot. why tf do they call it charging then?,"so you want to balance charge, which monitors each individual cell voltage and stops charging that cell when it's full its a ticking bomb. yeah ima balance charge many chargers *only* balance charge"
"is there a way to set a switch from the RC so i can change between rate presets? for Ex. i want a slow rate preset for cinema, and a fast one for freestyle.","I know with the HOTA ones the only way to not balance charge is to not plug in the balance leads, which prompts an ""are you sure"" warning Damn ok, i just got the Imars mini from a rc shop near me, im still gonna try it but ill keep this in mind a charger that doesn't even display the voltage is of somewhat limited utility"
You think a lipo thats been sitting for 5 years is done for?,"might be, might not be. do a full cycle and see how many mah it actually stores. ah you have no way of doing that Yeah i cant even get it to charge just gonna buy a new one what voltage is each cell at well there's your problem Yeah and ive got no way to check"
what is pin pitch?. oh spacing between the pins,"Any thoughts on air 65 vs air 75 I *believe* it's a JST-PH 2.0, but you should verify the pin pitch yourself if I bought the Meteor65 pro, could I fly it outside. If there was no wind"
"Do you want to fly exclusively indoors, or mix indoor/outdoor?","Mix. Mainly outdoor tbh Go for the 75. Or bigger Yes, with no wind it'd be fine, just feels very slow"

My kingdom for the location of my wire strippers hey guys just got all my soldering stuff my dad said these are aight but i wanted yall's opinion  first time soldering I need help I got my moonlight kir today and one of the screws antennas was stack, tried to get it out using couple of screwdrivers and this happened: You should not have any wire exponsed at all Nothing until you break your antenna"
Uh is it bad for my battery to stick out this much?,its not great for aerodynamics but itll be fine as long as its secure.
Are there wider bt2.0 batteries that wouldnt stick out and look so silly? O.o,"Well, the ufl are well seated, so just leave it alone until you need to deal with it ya the problome is the i need to deal with it. I need to disconnect the antennas and put them here No, all the folded cells bt2.0 batteries are the same cells, so all the folded 550-450-300-260mah 1s batteries are the same size. (btw, yours isn't, so you could get drastically better performance by getting some folded cells) someone suggest me to solder my driver and then unscrew it (refer to https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250 for the brands) ik the wire is left over from a lan cable i crimped today i mean the solder points That does work sometimes, just sand the screw before"
you are talking about a sand paper right?,"Well, they aren't the greatest joints ever, you should tin the wire before soldering it to the pad and use more flux Also don't use Ethernet wiring for that"
You think i can try with this littel driver?,"Yup. Just sand both sides, put solder on both ends, solder together, and spin. And hope it works ìk about the wire  i actually bought the wrong flux and this was just with the rando solder that was on the mamba practice board i mean are they too hot too cold cuz idk  the iron was set around 300c Waiting for my betafpv order with the lava version. I assume thats the correct one, but it might take five decades to arrive :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: You should use 350-370°c, just don't stick your iron into the pad for 30min, and get better flux, search for some stanol leaded 63/37 solder, otherwise, get the tbs solder"
"just to clarify, to unscrew the screw i need to unscrew it counterclockwise?",Yeah the lava use grepow cells. You need to unscrew it in the way that doesn't screw it in. (CCW iirc) to unscrew the left one its ccw
noted - will use higher temp i got some pretty good solder all the people ive asked recomend it the flux i got now is liquid - will it work or go i have to get the goo kind?,the question is if its the same to the other screw
"It's the same on all metric screws. Idk how feet people do, probably the same. Also, don't go dumb high temp wise, there is absolutely no need to go above 370°c Well, I like the tbs flux, having flux in a seringe is so much more convenient Also, instead of vaguely saying that your solder is good, can you instead just say the name of the solder ? Same for the flux",mb solder is Cynel Proffesional 60/40 0.7mm  its a polish brand the flux is some generic universal - NN Electronics is  the brand
not much?. it has nicer graphics I guess?. it doesn't really get updated with new quads and stuff. it's nice that it's on steam,"Well, you can get a lot of quads on the steam workshop, tho you don't have tinywhoops or XClass quads like velocidrone okay but like no one wants to do thattt"
fr. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) is multiplayer free in both of them?,"I do it, also if I just use the GEPRC mark5 from the steam workshop, then liftoff becomes more realistic than velocidrone compared to my 5"", even after testing all the 5"" quads in velocidrone yeah that’s mainly why i want it over velocidrone i mean just. add velocidrone to steam. boom"
"If there’s a 6-24v to 5v buck converter, can you run 6s through that? Fully charged 6s is 25.2v, which isn’t much more","I mean besides probably having a severely shortened life, potentially undesired output voltage or just completely shitting out immediately it'd be fine I might just either charge to 4v/cell or get one that’s designed for higher loads. The converters do shut off at 32v as an over-voltage shutoff thingy… so 25v shouldn’t be too much worse"
My radiomaster pocket Thrust and Pitch are somehow flipped when I'm in betaflight. how can I swap these?,"what mode are the sticks physically configured to, and what stick corresponds to what channel Not sure if I'm looking at the right thing, but the Mixes page says:  Ch1: Ail Ch2 Ele Ch3: Thr Ch4: Rud. ch5-7 are SA,SB,SC. Gonna try swapping 2 and 3 ok, hmm, AETR is the default in betaflight too huh now roll and throttle are swapped. wtf did I do lmao yeah, 3 is throttle. hmm"
Dumb question. Is there a way to know my battery level on drone for analog drones? I'm using a cobra x,what dji goggles. v1 or v2 yea in betaflight add it to your osd
should i do props in or props out for freestlying?,"weird it's already in betaflight, but in my goggles i don't see the osd stuff this is how it looks in betaflight. In goggles i just see the image. nvm got it. it's showing the preview for the wrong osd id say its a solid idea"

"I get a giggle from knowing quite how dead a human occupant of my machines would be.  I like that I can pull maneuvers with my quads that no pilot could survive. Makes up for the fact that I'm not (yet) able to actually _feel_ the flight..

"Hey, i have a question regarding AIO's for tinywhoops etc., so the AIO's like the BetaFPV F4 12A one, for example, have an ELRS receiver built in, so that makes sense, but do they not need an antenna? I have a Tinyhawk 3 freestyle and the only antenna i can find is coming off of the VTX, and my Radio outranges my Video, so how does that work?. or is this lil red thing an antenna, and is it just like.. that good?","the antenna is not good, ELRS is and it's about as good as a small ELRS antenna would be. better than the tower antennas anyway ohh alright, thats cool. okay, makes sense!. thank youu :) Yeah. Wanted 3000kv but wasn't in stock. Tempted to return these motors whilst they're still new.. Didn't know if 3000 was the absolute limit or if I can get away with 3150. We're about to see. I would say that even 2800 might be a little too much. but if you know what you're doing then it can be a pretty fun build"
can you link the build?. what size motors are they? And what's the rest of the specs,https://www.letsgetgreasy.com/post/bacon-s-b3ast-3-freestyle-build  Only differences in my build are I have brother hobby 3150kv 2004s and am not using DJI. Everything else is the same including stack + frame. The build is using Emax Eco II 2004s@3000kv. My batteries are dogcom 650 MaH 6s
"oh it's from bacon. makes sense. yeah if you're up to spec on the ESC then it should be fine. it will fly... interestingly, but in a fun way. I'm guessing this isn't a first build right?","Excellent, thank you! I was looking for something slightly smaller and quieter than my 5"" which still flies cool. He has 2 vids on the build and it looks so clean so thought I'd give it a try I would say it's completely overkill, but I also have a 6s 3"" that makes no sense from a completely different point of view 2nd build. 1st was a 6s 5"" freestyle but tbh I don't think I did very well. It flew but I didn't tune it as I knew nothing about PIDs till very recently. Went with a BF preset and burnt two motors. Since then + many crashes  I've learnt sooo much though so I cherish those mistakes. Ah but it's fun right, that's why we do it :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"

"I have these stock antennas on the Cobra SD. Can anyone suggest antenna upgrades that can improve the reception in general or if that's not possible, at least improve directional reception?. When I fly, I orient them like this. Works well for most of the flying upto about 250 mtr radius.",literally anything else basically Have gone upto about 1km line of sight distance at a beach. The antenna on the quad is foxeer lollipop 4 rhcp going from circular polarized to linear loses you 3db. truerc and prodrone.pl make good antennas
"I have a couple of omni antennas lying around. Not really branded ones, not as compact as the Lollipop4. Do you think they will work better?","you want an omni and a directional, both with the same polarization as the one on your quad"
on which BF version are u?,hi folks so im tryna use a gps with my betaflight drone rn and i have everything wired but but none of the baud ratings are working.
Which *exact * GPS module are u using?,BN-880. it was previously used on an ardupilot drone and worked fine (same fc as the current one)
"power off the drone, just insert the USB cable and post a screenshot of the Port tab. set the baudrate of the GPS to AUTO. Save and once rebooted plug in your battery. post again a screenshot of the ports tab. set it to 115200, save and go back to the ports tab. Is it still 115200 or did i go back? If it didnt go back, check via the command u used earlier if the GPS is communicating with the FC","it says at that. gps passthrough is garbage output thats correct. thats what the GPS is sending to the FC yeah ik but afaik thats not the correct format. the output should be human-readable continue with what i wrote it is communicating with the fc yes great. So set the GPS so it can see the sky without a wall or window in between. Go to the GPS Tab and see if it gets satellites and your location after waiting a few seconds/minutes in here it says that it should be red thats the wrong protocol i think. use ublox. GPS should be yellow if its working properly product page says nmea iirc. oh shit its cause im using soft serial. idk why that gps wont work, i just swapped over to a m6 gps"
"So people say to fly packs down to 3.5 volts per cell, does that mean on 6s i can fly till it says 21.0 volts on low throttle or is it better to land between 21.5-22 volts?. And is it normal to sag to 19 volts?",uart6 on the speedybee f405 v3 is a softserial. gps is supposed to be connected there
Ah. The GPS work properly when you solder it to u3?,i swapped over to a ubloc one too. bn880 is nmea only afaik The new UBLOX GPS modules are bombproof. Cheap too. I have one here myself. lmaoo nice. i have this m6. NEO-6M GPS Module GY-GPS6MV2. might swap it to a Geekstory GT-U7 GPS NEO-6M cuz its smaller I have a little Foxeer M10Q-180. Does the job perfectly.. It's been on 3 different quads. Just **works**.
what should we be looking for?,"so on the drone of a friend, we plugged in his battery (drone was wokring fine before) and smoke came out of a motor. we're not sure what to do now HDZ goggles are only sold on their website, no third parties afaik. Look for a burned esc Components that look burned or damaged compared to the ones next to them ESCs tend to be pretty obvious where they failed"
Is us guessing the AIO part of the question? :winking_face:,mb. its the new one on the Crux3 1s  crazy bee 4 with elrs. https://www.getfpv.com/electronics/flight-controllers/aio-all-in-one-fc/happymodel-expresslrs-f4-5a-5-in-1-aio-fc-w-built-in-2-4ghz-rx.html. this one See above :yellow_heart:. Remove the solder blob that's joining those two pads and it'll cut the power to the VTx.
this one on top right?. yup aight. um can it be done trough betaflight or nah?,Nah. Just melt it with your soldering iron then clean the iron's tip. Keep doing this till that blob is gone.  Or use a solder sucker (Engineer SS-02 :chefkiss:)
Thank you. Any thoughts on batteries?,Hello to everyone   Guys I'm new to the hobby.  I bought  Walksnail avatar hd x googles And radiomaster pocket elrs  Now I'm looking  for some cheap fpv drone to practice with that compatible with the owned accessories  Suggestions for reliable batteries for drones and googles. And a good charger  Any help would be appreciated You can get a walksnail tinywhoop. Small durable and fun. Can fly indoors https://droneshop.nl/hdzero-goggles not in stock tho There is a list of brands u should get somewhere in here Emilia is pretty knowledgeable regarding that stuff
What's the resistance rating for the Tmotor v3 2306 1950kv. ?,depends on what drone you pick. there's also the bassline and such you can get Does thay look fucked. I think the coating is gone
guys ive flown my fpv in a dusty area and some debris got into my motors. any tips to clean them?,"Take the bell off and use an air compressor if you have one. But just take the bell off and clean however works okay thanks it seems like ill need to do it each time then :sleepy_face: Check the continuity with a multimeter, if it doesn't give any reading then it's still on, if it does give a reading, it melted away, which could cause issues,  (even if I'm not sure how much of an issue given it's not touching any neighboring poles) the windings is all one wire, so I thought regardless it will give continuity Not if there is the coating on top dummy i got perfectly fine motors beeping"
are there types of flux that you have to clean up?. like are they conductive?,"no-clean flux means it's not corrosive. if it isn't no-clean and you leave it on there, it will eat away at your board and destroy it well it dont say i have to clean it. but it dont say its no clean did u buy no-name. even though we told you to buy name-brand"
only for the flux tho the people at the shop recomended it. i did get good solder. is this bad?,"last time this happened they gave someone welding flux. and then their entire board was ruined nah its for soldering  but its not the goo type that disolves its straight up liquid I Made a Suggestion about a micro drone channel and they closed it for some reason. Why @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) why isnt my wick removing solder even though i have flux on it and im pressing on the solder point with the wick. and the iron on the other side If you poke them you will just go through the coating, just rest the thingy lightly and nicely on the winding. Also, if it's on the same pole, it might now actually be an issue, I don't really know Welcome to why I recommended the Desoldering tool I did. Enjoy that."
is this the correct setting for testing for shorts?,Yis. Touch the leads together to check it's working mine doesnt beep. :CLd_Sadge:
How would you do full gps fail checks to insure if anything happens it will come back or failsafe will work.   So far I've turned off the controller and it worked. And then just manually activated it from far out and that worked. Should I also try turning off the goggles?,Well that sucks. Turning off the goggles won't do much Video loss won't trigger failsafe. This is why I have a manual failsafe switch. Just activating a failsafe on the quad to check gps rescue is good enough Ye I got a manual switch as well just want to ensure it will 100% work. I'll try a low flight. Behind a solid obstacle see what it does
these two should not be touching right?,"Hits the obstacle most likely. It can't see, it's just plotting a reverse course and following it blindly. i have no idea whats wrong"
is it normal that if i touch the black to gnd everything else beeps?,Im supposed to see that here
i have no idea. how can i cheack if the vtx getting power or not?,well I'd imagine it would have some kind of light :thinkies:
need a better picture of your real life wiring honestly. do you have a multimeter?,see if your 10v rail is alive at all. oh you poor soul. you soldered it reverse
VCC is supposed to go to BAT right?,Na that one looks fine i know something was weird I have mine connected to the battery pads ngl
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) did i destroyed something? or i just need to connect the wires differently?,"no VCC goes to the 10V pad. It's your lucky day because you didn't destroy anything lol nikko tricked me..... he saying that is ok it happens. nothing bad happened so it's okay. the moonlight needs like 8 to 26 volts. it's better to connect it to the regulated pad on your FC than directly to the battery. because even though y'know, it can handle it theoretically you don't want your poor little VTX under that stress"
how do i connect it now?,"Just move the SBUS to the 10v pad. And if betaflight any everything is set correctly move the VCC to 10V. and move the GND to the GND next to the 10V. and check if the RX goes to TX and the TX goes to RX. I mean a BAT pad is just as good as directly soldering it to the frigging + and - pads on the ESC really Either way that is what I did and it worked. Tho when I planned to fly it, for some reason my radio was acting up so I took my cinewhoop since that was fine. Need to swap the VTXs on those"
If red is vcc Black is gnd Rx is white Tx is gray  Which wire go to which solder bubble?,Red Black White  Grey. From top down also stop burning the dang plastic. gonna get a disease at this point I cant man its too hard:loudly_crying_face: is because you have no angle. kind of hard to solder like that Ya i know. And this fucking solder gave me a burn on my hand Ahhh the good old days
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) do you confirm?,"In pika we trust:folded_hands:. I will just use a smoke stopper after the solderi. ng Good I only sometimes trust pika. As long as you gave the correct colors, its correct what an intense gif jeez Im not home, but some online friends made a funny video about me   It goes like ""what is going on inside their head"" and ya get the rest But yeah the order it correct. Worst case. Its not :) Worst case, i have a 200$ brick The video in question. So trust me its good"
@Pika @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). am i good?,you swapped grey and white. it was supposed to be like this
"bruh im stupid. beyond the gray and white, the black and the red are ok? its not supposed to be in the same line with the letter?","Well, that plug isn't a plug anymore"
yup its ok?. or yup  I need to lower them all by one?. man:loudly_crying_face:. its so hard to solder them. its so tiny,"it's okay. just swap the grey and the white one emilia. i love you. :star-struck::star-struck::star-struck::star-struck::star-struck:. yay. i dont have a 200$ brick I know, that plug is about as melted as my 65mm frame used to be"
but its only for the dji cable right?. damn the vtx is super hot,yeah don't leave that on. without a fan pointed at it
"Do you think its a problem that i have the vtx cables, receiver cables and the capacitor really coupiled to the vtx?",if it was analog yeah. but not in this case
Maybe with the caddx app?,yeah. but you still need to have the goggles powered
"emilia the two pads are not connected anymore but i think the left one is connected to the ""capacitor"". it is is it a problem?","Because i destroyed the shit out of the antenna screw (and I wasnt able to take the antennas because of that) , i came up with this solution. You tell me if its good or not. I cut both of the antennas mounts and inserted they in"
Was it connected before?,no no. they was in. i just cut the annetans mount to fit them in my quad in that picture you sent before. it wasn't they arent touching in the product pictures here i have another picture in the same day @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). They are in alright. that poor screw Ya i know. Im 100% fucked if i want to change the antennas in the future
"Tried it. Didnt work. Maybe solder but i was afraid that some of the solder will fall into the antenna hole. But i can try and tape the hole in the future if i really want to change the antennas. Back to my question, because i cant get the antennas out of the vtx, and cant slide it in the antennas mount om my quad, i cut in the mount and insert them in, the question is if it fine or not? I dont want the antennas to fly out of the mount in a middle of a flight…. .","little bit of tape. it'll be finee If you are really stressed about it, add some e6000 or similar silicone glue (no liquid crazy glue that will be impossible to remove) around the antenna mounting and where you cut up the mount, but it's fine idk how but they are still connected it doesnt look like it  can see the pcb in the middle. but the meter still detects connection"
"yo every time i fly my drone after about a minute the gyro keeps getting messed up i have to bring the right stick half way to the left to keep it leveled other wise itll turn 45 degrees to the right and fly away, does anyone know why this is happening? i have the artificial horizon thing to see the line, but after a minute the line turns about 45 degrees when im flying it  level.",are we expecting the usa drone bans to hit prebuilt dji stuff or a bunch of components like air units too

guys i'm searching for a good battery heatshrink cover. what width should i search for?,"The TX16S expects to run from a 2S LiPo/Li-Ion battery. It comes with a tray for 2x 18650 to make a 2S Li-Ion from those, but it can run from any reasonably sized 2S lipo just as well.. The TX16S is also capable of charging its battery, via its charging USB Port. The charging circuitry is a bit limited in terms of balancing capability, so it's recommended to check and balance the battery with a proper charger once in a blue moon. a HOTA D6 can charge a 2S 18650 pack, but it will require both connectors (balance plug and XT60) to be wired up. The tray in the TX16S only comes with one, so you have to make an adapter (2S balance plug to XT60 + 2S balance plug) or modify the tray"
"TY, could i just skip the tray and use a 2s battery? the squared ones?","if it fits, yes. the TX16S takes power through the balance plug TY very much, i was lots all the way. lost"
"just 1 more question, while i wait for my battery to arrive, can i pplug the controllet to the pc and use it without batteries for the uncrashed sim?. or i need the batterie. battery","generally speaking, these radios don't run without batteries. I figured out a workaround **on a RM Pocket**. I don't know if that workaround will work on a TX16S.. Or if it is safe, as it puts power into the radio through a path that wasn't intended for it. ill wait for my battery then TY. haha"
"hi fellow pilots! i got a hota F6 and im trying to discharge my 6s packs (3300mah/8000mah), but it takes forever, as i dont have anything for external discharge... is there something i can buy and connect via xt60 to speed up the discharge process ? its taking hours (my drone is currently dead, so i have to get the packs to storage voltage somehow)",How fast does my Micro sd card have too be for my full sized airunit. I got one with 100 m/Bs and its Not enough
Can't the TX16 run off the USB power input (bottom usb)?,"generally speaking no Oh. I've never tried, but I thought it would run off the bottom USB. That's... A bit odd.. One USB for power (bottom), one for data (top). I thought, anyway.. the bottom USB runs the charger. if the charger sees no battery... it doesn't run you can run the radio from the data USB, but it requires some trickery. and there is the question of the data USB having wiring good enough to power the RF module A big enough capacitor where it expects the battery might do it... :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. Maybe stick a resistor in series so as to not confuse the charger with the ""charge rate"". basically:  When you plug in the Data USB, with the radio OFF, the radio's main chip goes into firmware update mode Yeah, the chicken feet light up"
"since most raidos run STM32, same as FC's, you can use Betaflight Configurator to make it exit firmware update (DFU). (it has a button for it). well, that just makes the radio reboot... so nothing useful, right?. well, if you hold the power button on the radio while clicking Exit DFU.... it might just boot up :face_with_tears_of_joy:","Hah, that's worth remembering. on Windows this requires fixed drivers (IRC Driver fixer). just FYI. Note: you need a properly powered USB port. not like... 3 USB hubs down Also; don't run the Tx above 100mA or risk browning out the port."
"I mean USB ports can go up to amps, in some instances. issue is... can the radio's circuitry?. That's why I'd definitely recommend disabling the internal RF for this","That display on the TX16 will pull a little too. and on the TX16S, the screen is a major power draw... yeah. that's why I said - I know it works on a RM Pocket. no guarantees otherwise"

"Cause it's a very happy boy  More seriously, it's just the pid tune, since you use dumb high kv motors for 6s, the pid tune is trying to make it levelled at all time, but when you hit the ground it tilts it slightly, so it tries to adjust, but because of the really high kv motors it over shoots and goes in the air, and repeat, each time a bit more since it falls from higher, it's normal, just  ### *don't do it inside you fool, if the fc freaks out a little too much it can either punch a hole in your ceiling or actively try to chop you in half*. Ok, cool, maybe formulate a question ?  And give us some information like a screenshot (not a picture of your monitor) of the modes tab on betaflight","i can t connect the quadcopter to betaflight lmao yeah okay. also is it oaky if my core temp is 70c. its just sitting Yes, but *always* have a fan blowing over your quad when it's just sitting on the bench, otherwise it could just end up cooking itself (especially the vtx) got it. ty. i should get a VPS. variable power supply A lot of chargers actually can do psu too yeah i think mine can"
"ohh yeah, both RP and RPY let me use them :). thank youu. works now. oh i just had the standard tinyhawk settings and applied the UAV Tech Micro 2'' preset. wouldnt i want RPY then, or is RP better?","if i remember correctly i think you need to change your pid tune preset You have to change that, there are 4 option, I forgot which one lets you use the sliders, but just pass through the 4 and see for yourself. It can indeed let you use them (not the case with all of them), but that's just because the person who did the pid tune had them on/off, but you can switch them on by yoursekf Use whichever one you prefer, I'm not into tuning I can hardly help you here alright, i think RP then, sincei want to keep the yaw pid how it is"
can anyone vc with me and help me pick out. some fpv gear?,i told you what you should get last week or something. we went back and forth for like 3 hours. and you got it approved in here too
Should i charge my batts to 100% before using my radio ? Also do y'all use an external charger for them ?,most modern radios have an internal charging circuit. so you can jsut plug it in
What mount do you all recommend for a gopro hero 12?  Flying a Nazgul Evoque.  What are you currently using?,depends on your flying but usually most people recommend fixed angle cage like mounts
Is it possible that my 21700 are too Big and i cant close the batts cover ? x),"yeah idk if 21700 fit in it its meant for 21  damn Yeah, iirc @Pika had to grind down their battery case to make them fit Lol just slice down the two things on the cover. Weird thing they didn't chdck But happy with it so far. I used an exacto knife and slowly sliced it down. They say to use 21700s :KEKw:. And the provided 2cell thingie is meant for 21700 Yep. But other that. Lovely radio. But regardless. I might swap to an ag01 pocket. Its similar price, and with ag01s (of course not full sized like the t20)"
Thanks a lot it closed haha. And Can't you just buy ag01 and put them in the T20?,Sure but I like the buttons on radiomasters. And the boxer is too big for my liking. And getting ag01s for the t20 is literally like 10 bucks less then the pocker And not 1w of output power with big gimbals i mean a tiny radio sound fun t20 feel hug
"I doubt I ever use it, but the pocket does what?",And t20 is considered small And baby little gimbals t20 is literally the smallest Damn. With full sized t20 *is* the tiny radio along with the Pocket they're almost the same size
also what sim should i get ?,Velocidrone or liftoff. They are the main ones
"okok , lift off have steam workshop right ?","Yup. And if you exclusively use the steam workshop quads and completely disregard the baked in ones, liftoff is really really good"
Does radiomaster sell standalone buttons?,"Switches yes, buttons idk Like the 2 and 3 position switches they sell them they have some momentarys too but i dont know about the boxer bumpers n stuff. otherwise ask support theyll prob let you buy them through there liftoff is probably the worst I disagree. I love liftoff but you're French. sooo So I'm right. Exactly. Buy liftoff. It's great go arrest more CEO's. smh I will arrest the guy that made velocidrone and tryp so people buy liftoff instead developers don't really update it and they current just want to do ML/AI stuff ***the steam workshop exist*** i don't care if the steam workshop exists. you're paying developers that don't do shit -# *and it had an update so now you have battery voltage with a little sag. -# incredible I know I don't care, just use the steam workshop quads, they work great so you hate DJI and shit for doing similar anti-consumer stuff. but then when it's on Steam you don't care Yes, in this current situation I am a full blown hypocrite and I don't care yeah that's obnoxious Yeah but the velocidrone 5"" quads just feel underpowered compared to what they are supposed to fly like sounds like it wasn't properly set up Idk, I just bought the game and extension, tried a few 5"" quads, and they flew like crap, I didn't touch anything else https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/boxer-accessories/products/boxer-switch-set-1. Now to wonder if these wi fit in the t20 You probably don't want to use them, they feel like crap compared to some like not button switches Well I want a button like switch, like on the boxer or pocket. Might check ali and mod the shit out of it going for minecraft fpv ngl"
How's the gimball feelings on the Jumper T15?,as long as you get the hall ones it's good
no?. AG01's are just hall gimbals but fancy metal,But you can buy ag01s and put it in
how hard is it?. what are procedures to do it?,From what I understood
Do you need the screen on the T15?,"I kinda remembered someone dremel the holes and screws for Ag01 On t20 you need to do some DIY. Dk bout the t15 if it gets the setting up job done quicker and easy, yeah But the t15 is bigger so il assume you don't need to then no. You want the screen because long range flying and graphics and such. not for settings up. I'd recommend you get the Boxer Crush honestly yeah I was thinking of Boxer Crush because I wanted to add light mods into it"
It has ag01s. For a very decent price@. I think its 180?,"180, big price gap from Boxer Max"
Why would you ever buy the boxer max?,It has carbon fiber. Fancy
The max is 260. And the basic boxer is 130? I think. 140. So an extra 50 bucks for ag01s,I'd pay 40 bucks for AG01's lol They are 189 so 50 but yeah worth it. And it comes in cool colors. The boxer crush is end game radio. Ag01s cool color
As in flying acro or?. Connecting it to a sim?,"No idea what acro is , but yeah like connecting to a sim and what button does what would be nice xD An end game radio but at a beginner friendly-ish price If you have the battery inside press the power up button and plug in the usb cable Ah yeah did that. it work Then go in the sim and set it up, no clue how lift off does it, but there should be a ""controller"" options somewhere. Considering how much ag01s cost. Yeah. Super friendly price"
"fire?. if you're talking about a 5"". that's okay then","in general, you set up what button does what yourself, so you can pick Should my ELRS reciever be fine under the FC the esc is what to worry about. fc is fine We don't talk about my soldering but the ESC will be like this. In theory only the wires should touch the capacitor why don't people put like 5000kV on a 6s quad lol yeah. why don't we put 25000kV on a 5"". 6s. great idea"
Is there any one youy are using or reccommend?,i dont fly with any action cams sorry. just look on thingiverse. ''nazgul evoque gopro mount'' or something
"I'm no expert, but in the US, wouldn't VLOS be the limiting factor there? Assuming recreational and not Part 107.","How do you change joystick inputs in beta flight, my throttle is my pitch and my roll is my throttle. Its so chaotic help Way to do it carefully. Wiggle X channel. Note what it corresponds to in betaflight.  Note that and be ready to swap it over as needed. Repeat for each chanel.  Depending on your radio, the radio should help to spell out its existing outputs channel setup."
That’s kinda low I think… what size drone?,"big. it's supposed to be big. like 15"" props and I spose the arms would have to be quite long it's supposed to fly for a while, that's what I thought initially. I haven't flown it yet. I tried to get maximum flight time, it's not racing or anything else. just looking at shit. like a bus ride Alr then low kv is better yeah that's why I got them. but I'm going by memory. I'll have to untape the big box"
is it normal that im scared of flying in acro mode?,"i mean, yeah, but practice a lot in the sim and get more confident. at first my hands were a bit shaky when flying, but confidence just comes with time after 20 hours in a sim im still not sure if i want to switch to acro"
but youre flying acro in the sim right? like you can crash there as much as you want,"hmm idk what advice to give tbh, just practice some more and get comfortable flying fast and tight corners etc. maybe learn some tricks, but i think you just gotta bite the bullet at some point if you wanna fly acro irl Try to remember to point where u wanna go. Then give throttle to go that way.  That was the thing that eventually clicked for me and made acro become a confident thing."
Only 20 hours?. Damn I don't think I even have 20 hours in sim. But I did go staright to acro no camera drone,"yeah it didnt help. still a black screen. im blaming it on the vtx @flurry0134 you only did 20 hours in the sim. Keep flying more hours in the sim using acro mode. If you were flying camera drones before, you would  be getting rid of all the bad habits you have been practicing with them To be fair, that's wild af when i plug the drone in after 15 secs the vtx goes hot i cant even touch it"
Not having or having 20 hours?,"Hi, i was just tuning my quad and got some concerning and weird behaviour..  if anyone experienced has some time, id appreciate some help figuring this stuff out.. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1278014650692407320/1278014650692407320 Acro and no camera :KEKw: No camera drones. Not acro los. That is wild fr Ahhhh I understand now Well that's  really shit.... after 2 teat flights.... the aio has somehow died..... now to take it apart and test..."
"But, how were those test flights?. Fun?","in doors for 20 seconds Nope I'm just a idiot.... I forgot to charge the batteries. I kept using the same battery for bench testing, setting up, flight tests. It ran out of juice opse.... :KEKw:"
"Bruhhhhhh. ""My aio died""  ""Have you tried a different battery?""",My excuse is I've worked 34 hrs in 2 days :p then had to build this by adding the dji o3 I'm tired!
Did you see? The o3 dropped to 179,"Ye I got mine for 160. On aliexpress :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Just out another order in using the 9 years of points I been collecting on ali. I have a 2nd pavl 25 v2 on way. Got that o3 for 118 I was charging my lipo and when i was checking it my down syndrome nephew was playing with it and now it wont power on. Its a imax B6AC damn.. that sucks.. maybe check if its getting power correctly, like whatever youre powering it with"
well.. possibly. what could your nephew even have done?,Idk the cable was tangled and all. I wasnt looking it was like that
Are the chargers supposed to last for like 10 to 20 years?. I mean it was old. I can assume its 10 years old. And it still wont turn on after cooling down. Good thing the battery didnt got bad,im not sure.. but i think if you treat your charger well it should last almost indefinitely.. Oh well i think i need to unscrew and take a look inside. Yeah no the charger is gone ill have to take a look once im in my home or here
"in fpv, do the RC and the goggles need to be conected? or is just the goggles conected to the drone? and the RC conected to the drone?",you have two sepereate things for the goggles and the radio on your drone. so the goggles connect to the vtx thats the video transmitter and the radio connects to the receiver for whatever protocol youre using
"oh okay, thank you so much for the help!. oh one more question, which pads do i solder the openlager module onto?. or is there like a diagram for it?. oh i think i figured it out, just to uart, 5v goes to 5v, ground to ground. this means uart 1 is free to use right?",To record blackbox the FC need a place to store the data. Some FC's have a SD card slot for it. Some have a flash chip for it.  If your FC doesn't have storage for blackbox then an openlager is an option you can go with to add recording functionality to an FC that doesn't have it. thank youu! i doubt mine has an sd card slot.. it might have a flash chip but idk how to tell  heres the manual for my quad: https://www.fyft.cz/user/related_files/tinyhawk_iii__plus_freestyle-rtf.pdf (AIO is on page 33)  sadly emax is... an annoying company and they dont really have the best info and resources for their quads Boards that size and use case almost never have flash. And I am not seeing it listed on specs for that FC. So it doesn't have it built in.  If it did then they would be proudly saying that in the product listing for that FC.
What AIO do you have?,i mean.. you could try taking the vtx off and testing if they still get hot
https://darwinfpv.com/products/darwinfpv-15a-1-3s-f411-ultralight-whoop-aio?variant=40668399501487. okay ill try,"Yes uart1 is free. There it likely pins for it on the FC i have a tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle, i already applied some presets, and did some other mods, but i just wanna learn how to tune and tune out propwash and other stuff"
"Hear me out, does it mean you have 2 FCs in your drone?","Ok for sure. It's a good skill to learn. idk. im still learning about the parts i think i need to tune it better, especially since i replaced the crappy serial ph2.0 connector to xt30 it has way more power and less battery sag, but i just wanna learn how to tune etc. okayy :) thank you so much, i appreciate all the help idk man, sounds like its fucked Cuz if you have 2 FCs its mad weird im not sure if its an aio or an esc. . Parts list can also work but you already said you have an AIO so should not have a seperate board on there here is the fc (i think so) AIO stands for All In One.  FC PDB 4X escs  Vtx maybe as well  Back in the day all of thoose were their own needed individual components. oh wait let me wipe my lens"
Ehm I am assuming the big square with the antenna is the VTX right?,Looks like your AIO is FC and 4 escs.  The separate board is probably the VTX or maybe RX I think VTX. But yeah if it worked. And now it does not. After water damage. Its prob a goner
so is it an aio or an esc?,You don't have a seperate ESC If getting to hot to touch instantly there is a short.  You might get lucky and the VTX might still work. But if that larger diamond shaped board gets hot fast.  And no the motor tones are not fully completing. Then your AIO is done. You have an AIO (FC + ESC) and a VTX okay ty. i think im gonna buy the aio and see if it was the problem. if it wasnt im just gonna buy a foxeer reaper extreme You can also temporarily wire the camera ouput. Directly into the VTX input. Then power them both with appropriate voltages. Then look in your goggles and see if the video systems still works.  That way you know if you need to get another VTX now or not.  Also you may consider getting conformal coating to waterproof the replacement parts. Thay way wet grass is very unlikely to ever kill it again. Assuming you apply it good.  READ and obey the safety gear reccomend on the bottle. That stuff is no joke. yeah i was thinking about conformal coating
can i use hdzero antennas on my analog goggles?,"I don't think so.. I don't know tho You can solder a board that has been conformal coated with silicone conformal coating, it will just smoke away (use a fan when you solder on one of those boards tho), and you can also remove it with isopropyl alcohol (use like 99.9%) oh alright, thank youu Yes, but often they come in a 4 pack, so not ideal since you will waste money on a set of redundant antennas, and if they come in 2, they will often be like 2 patches or 2 omnis, which isn't always optimal, just make sure that the connector and the polarization is correct"
"Oh damn. Thats not much. What about those micro frames 2"" or 3"" how much flight time I can achive with those?","its always about the same for freestyle quads, since the battery size and weight is always adjusted for the motor power"
So the estimated flight time is based on full blast flight?. I was looking for a small handy toy that doesnt cost much when it crashes but also is able to record some decend flight footage,"well obviously if you just hover and have the throttle at around 30 percent the entire time, youre gonna get longer fligh times than when you do high speed maneuvers. i think what youll want is a cinewhoop then, theyre small drones that can carry an action cam and are usually for videography and stuff That sounds exactly what im looking for. Thanks man alright, i assume you dont have any gear yet, so youll have to decide if you wanna build the drone yourself or buy a pre built one, theres some good prebuilt ones but ofc with self-built ones you can repair it easier and theres more customizability Ofc I do diy. Easy to repair is what I would like to achive good call, i havent built a cinewhoop, so i dont think ill be much help in that department, but i think youll be able to find some good youtube videos, and theres also very qualified people in here, lol. but ill try to answer further questions if you have any, lol yeah. if they're the correct polarization and connector"
"Yeah, but what it like? Connecting a few DC to 3Phase AC converter to a brain and mount the camera :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Well tweaking ofc will be the hard part. Assembling everything should be easy I think","well generally what you need for a drone is: Flight Stack or AIO (Flight controller and ESC) VTX (Video Transmitter) Camera RX (Receiver for Radio) Frame  Motors Yes you can, assuming the right connector and polarity and yeah its just soldering the stuff together on the right pads and connecting the camera then binding the controller, thats it. then there's tuning the drone but there are some presets you can apply"
Is it cheaper to buy a kit or everything seperate?,"im not sure if there are kits that sell everything, people usually buy all the stuff separately, although there are kits for the VTX which already come with a camera a VTX and an antenna initial buy should be kit lately. depending on who you buy from of course. But it seems more cost effective to buy a kit and then replace/swap parts as needed Maybe I just pick a prebuild because im too lazy to pick every part separate :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Fuck no, rtf kits litteraly all suck"
ohh you meant kit as in RTF kit?. ohh yeah.. no,"If you mean kits as a weird way to say a bnf, then sure i mean BNF specifically what you could do is buy a prebuilt drone, and then you can buy the corresponding goggles and radio when you picked a drone you want, i think usually for cinewhoops people use Walksnail and for the radio nowadays everyone uses ELRS, so i think you want that, if not.. pls correct me if im wrong Also, that's only true with some BNF if all the parts are from the company that sells the quad, quite a few bnf from companies that are more ""assemblers"" will be the same price or more expensive than building yourself ""depending on who you buy from of course"" should be doing some lifting here"
"Ok so walksnail seems to be the camera system, but what about the frame, what am I looking for?","from what ive heard, the geprc cinebot30 is a pretty good frame / drone. yeah theres Analog and Digital systems, Analog has worse video but is cheap, and Digital is expensive but good, there's Walksnail, DJI and HDZERO, you basically just pick whichever one you like best, but price is a consideration to make if you're going to go analog goggles, ebay is your friend I think im going for analog, im not made from money :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: i bought my fatshark HDO's with a good module for about $250 on ebay used for a Radio and goggles you can refer to the shopping list  #deleted-channel. but the cheaper ones (Ev800d) are really not good, id recommend the Cobra x if its in your budget. or this Or maybe I fly like I do now, without camera system :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Better save some money before buying stuff twice if you're worried about buying extras, this might be a rough hobby for you its pretty difficult to get camera footage if you cant see what youre filming :KEKw: That's not entirely true :KEKw:"
What is the most standard AWG for battery power and motor power?   Trying to buy wires in bulk for repair,"I´ve been flying with a 10y old drone rn, without live camera. It gives me some footage. Just hard to estimate objects when you get far away :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. No, I mean I do the grind without help now and just buy later. But good stuff. Not cheap stuff Depends on the size of the drone i'd refer back to the ebay mention then, specifically with analog goggles, as people are offloading them to switch to digital"
How much for a digital one?,"my goggles are from 2018 but its not like analog tech has changed much :v. a digital system can be 2x-3x the cost in parts altogether in comparison to analog. but it looks gorgeous Hmmm. Sounds okay-ish 12 or 14 gauge for 5in, 18 or 20 for 3in Didnt flyed fpv yet anyways. So plan is digital goggles are more like 300-500 Build a cinewhoop, without camera, get skill in VLOS and invest in good camera system i won't yuck your yum but i would recommend just buying a dji drone if you're not going to use the fpv part I want to use it, why not learn tricks in close range for a while until I saved enough money for good camera system i meann,  _technically_ the avata is a cinewhoop I want 360° of control :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: i definitely fly completely different in fpv vs LOS i think you might be well off with the dji avata, its just expensive and i think other cinewhoops can do better, and you cant repair or customize anything abt it i mean theres nothing in the rule books saying a dog CAN'T play basketball Idk I wont mind if I just start in like 10 meter range of LOS before upgrading to fpv i think you'd be better off dinking around in a flight sim, thats pretty cheap in itself Its not the same :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: i'd argue its closer than flying an fpv drone exclusively LOS Not exclusively. Upgrade later. Save money for better parts. Its just a few months. More than buying a cheap analog system i'd probably wait until i could afford all of it at once ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Does it make a price difference?,i can't predict the future with deals and sales So this is an ADHD issue :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
but i wouldn't doubt they'd be coming up since the end of the year is soon. are you looking to take footage with this bad boy?. i will echo this sentiment as well,"Yes. I heard a lot of good things about that drone :upside-down_face: are you going to strap a gopro to it or take footage from the VTX Depends. Lets say gopro if gopro then you'd be perfectly fine with analog imo. if digital the footage could be acceptable without an action camera mounted, and the cinewhoop could potentially be lighter Hmmm, makes the choice really difficult rn when digital gets more affordable to me i will likely upgrade. but i am wreckless with my whoops Ok, analog it is than. Your simple words are better explaining than the big amount of facts you wrote before i'll be sure to let my writer know your feedback :V. fortunately i was looking for the exact stuff you were but a few months earlier, so its all still top of mind Same thing with the E-scooter community I'm assisting. Hard to convince people for the right choice. Thanks for your help, I think I have a direction im going for"
whats the best drone simulator for learning to fly fpv?,i will go insane from your constant double posting. i swear mb :pensive_face:. if u help ill never do it again :folded_hands: velocidrone or literally anything else. velocidrone is often regarded as having the best physics
I'm guessing it has some kind of tutorial?,"from what ive watched There's nothing you can't learn from a video the main thing is i have no experience and i want a sim that will help me learn idk if i explained that well. sorry My crossfire module is inducing video distortion.. I was curious for months.. But when I plug in it looks good. Then I turn on my tx and it does this. You'll learn either way :p The basic controls isn't something that it can just ""teach"" you. and the rest is just turns and such yeah just go through bardwell's learning to fly playlist I'll be back later with video"
so i should get velocidrone and then watch tutorial videos?,"It's been going on long enough I'll probably make a help thread. I don't get it. Velocidrone with the freestyle pack, learn how to hover and the controls and then go from there"
thank you!. should i get the microdrone pack since i have the meteor 75?,"if you want. I wouldn't though Okay got stupid ass video. When my degenerate ass gets back from the casino, imma ask for input."
"Hey guys, so the other day I was flying my drone and it was going great, but then when I got it really high up, it started flipping out. Any idea what could cause that?

I don't know how it works in Croatia but if you do the online exam you get A1 and A3 oh, thanks, thats nice. what about frequencies. i saw a reddit post saying some of them are booked for data providers and you can get fined i you use them if you stay on the 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz bands it's pretty much fine [License website in Croatia I believe](<https://www.ccaa.hr/>) Thank you so much, appreciate the help"
what antennas are they?,it's a sleeve dipole. linear
okay ty. can you tell me what connector does it have?. i am switching to rhcp and i dont want to buy the wrong one,uFl. IPEX. MHF1. they're all different names for the same thing (MHF1)
okay. whats ufl tube?,"foxeer has this. mmxc tube long, ufl tube, ufl tube long oh, that just means that the antenna has some length of a solid stem So im trying to set the motor direction in the motors tab in betaflight but if i check them to reverse they stop and keep spinning in the wrong direction That's not what that switch does. that merely *informs* Betaflight that they're spinning that way. use esc-configurator to reverse your motors"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBZxFdJUFRg&list=PLwoDb7WF6c8l24IM83wIS94XzhuMVC2gx&index=10 Why is it working for him then??,which menu specifically are you talking about. ohh. yeah I don't know the actual reason why that sometimes doesn't work. I've seen people talk about it being an issue related to DSHOT in Betaflight but you'd have to ask someone else. just change it in esc-configurator and be done with it https://esc-configurator.com/
did you... even open the link?,"if you have blheli32 then yes. if you have anything else, then no. but since it didnt detect the esc i assume you need this: <https://esc-configurator.com/>. then just click on connect plug in battery. press read settings bottom right and send another screenshot click on read settings to get your esc's. and there it should give you information about the motor direction"
what settings on this?. like the pwm?,"you dont need to flash your esc for the motor direction. go back to the mains screen. it should say read settingsa. hold on i got that. but how do I get it on there when you set the desired direction changes, just click write settings you can save it with ""write settings"" ok cool. It works now!! Thank you"
should i choose lhcp or rhcp?,sigh. for what video system
Did I kill my esc by landing too harshly ? Everything else seems fine but there is no beeping nor movement when pluging the battery,It happened like :. Landing on a road. motors stop. and can't get any responce since pictures of the esc maybe fair. There's nothing out of the ordinary speedybee :loudly_crying_face: And the ribbon is correctly connected. Ah
on beta flight right ?,no on esc-configurator <https://esc-configurator.com/> Failed to detect them
"Do you have Betaflight closed, battery plugged in?",Yes. I unpluged and repluged just in case and now I can't detect anything
Is soldering dangerous for respiratory tract in the body ? When I’m soldering sometimes I inhale the somoke from solder iron and I’m wondering if its dangerous / If i can get a cancer.,"Fumes related to soldering are known to be carcinogenic, so it can increase your risk of developing cancer as a result. However, most hobbyists are not soldering nearly enough to substantially increase the risk. In the interest of managing your risk, you should be using a fume extractor while you solder (something as simple as a small fan with an activated charcoal filter can be good enough) Don't add expo to throttle. Linear response all the way. That hover point moves as the pack depletes.. For a starting point, I would lower the centre sensitivity right down to 10, and set all the max rates all the same, at 120, with 0.5 expo.. That should give you loads of stick space to make tiny adjustments.  Also, all those beautiful looking vids you see are gyro stabilised footage, and mostly recorded on DJI drones that are practically flying themselves.  You may consider flying in angle mode for this. With a properly calibrated gyro, indoors with no wind, the machine should almost hover in place at stick zero input."
Can this work without buying expensive  solder like MG Chemical?  https://pyrodrone.com/products/tbs-solder-spool-100g,yes but it won't be as good oh  well I'll buy MG Chemical then make sure it's 63/37 and no-clean
"appreciate that bro ill give that a try. What about throttle limit, scale or off?",For the record TBS solder is 63/37 with flux and works great. :man_shrugging:
ta. you got a link to this solder that you use?,"Yep, only things with TBS name on worth buying is that solder, and their stick ends. I've used solder from TBS, Kester, Mechanik, MG Chemicals and Stannol. my personal ranking is 1. Stannol 2. MG Chemicals 3. Kester 4. Mechanik and 5. TBS. stannol is honestly a whole different league somehow I've only tried chipquick flux. that flux was pretty great though, but smellier than flux from say mg chemicals I don't know where you could get Stannol solder actually. It's from a German company. @Brutus loves it too ill have a google ty :slightly_smiling_face:. ooo not cheap :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. £25 for 250g I've gone to the length of taking it with me to the US lol"
"Hi all, so I took a plunge into FPV after 30 hours in a sim and purchased these: - Walksnail Goggles L - Radiomaster Boxer ELRS - BetaFPV meteor75 pro walksnail + elrs  I know I need to update the firmware on the goggles/drone and configure it in BetaFlight but dont know what settings to touch or how to bind my controller to drone + goggles etc. Any youtube vids/resources i can learn about these?","I wouldn't follow random yt tutorials for ELRS binding, there's an excellent written guide for it on the official documentation page https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/binding/ Just ordered some, as my TBS solder is on its last bits anyway! ty.. if you get stuck! just drop a messasge in this group. Most people in here are using ELRS so plenty of people to help. Good afternoon, I have bought a BETAFPV Meteor65Pro ELRS and I have a Jumper T-Pro ELRS Transmitter. I have already updated the station to the latest version of the ELRS receiver but I try to update the drone and it does not connect to the Wi-Fi network, well, the option to connect it does not appear at all. Can someone help me and explain to me how I can then update the Drone's ELRS Receiver ⁠help-and-support"
what tin to lead ratio of solder should i be using?,it's important you get it from a name brand. not some rando one from Amazon with good reviews
"yeye ofc, never wanna buy something super random when it comes to this lol. https://dk.rs-online.com/web/p/loddetin/7568904?gb=s",this is a good list of brands lol
something like this should be good right? I live in denmark so thats why,<https://dk.farnell.com/en-DK/stannol/hs10-2510-0-7mm-250g/solder-wire-362flux-0-7mm-250g/dp/817510>. as example
Anyone know the code to make the bot reply with the recommended gear for starting out with fpv?,"idk if the bot does it, but it's here #deleted-channel I mean I did say preferred. they didn't have the 63/37 on that site. lol ah alr. i literally cant find any 63/37 in denmark LOL"
"I feel like my VTX overheats…. It is kinda crappy signal, I get it, it’s analog, but still. Then it also gets hot… I don’t think it should be that hot…. Idk is it normal for a VTX at 25mw get too hot to touch?",yes. it needs a fan pointed at it 24/7
Even when flying?. Cause that’s not possible…,you can figure this out waffles. I believe in you I’m not attaching a fan to my drone while it’s flying. I worked so hard to remove the 2.5g that I did. I’m not adding that back for a fan waffles. what does a fan do
"what would flying do, would it perhaps achieve the same effect?",The motors do not blow the air in the direction of the VTX tho…
any pre cautions when it comes to battery charging? just curious. i purchased the hota d6 batteey charger and got my controller coming soon. simulator is gonna be bought tomorrow. . gonna get the drone very soon.. i just want to ensure i charge as safe as possible,"Guys, I think I ruined my tinywhoop. After direct solder motors it becomes acting weird. First arming and it’s ramping slowly up even if throttle is on 0. Rearming, and it’s fly but like on “pillow”, lowering throttle doesn’t drop I it like it’s used to, but slowly lowering, and it’s 2 times more battery hungry."
"Coming back to this after reading a lot, it seems that for whole EU, drone regulations are same. Now if I'm correct I need an A1 - A3 license for a privately built FPV drone that weighs around 600 grams +- 80 grams?","turbulent air is a thing and fans suck air from every direction, so they do actually, it's just not optimal, but just aim a fan at it when it's on the bench, and just fly when you aren't on the bench.."
:thumbs_up:. why is expressrls just saying loading on my radiomaster boxer? Ive tried multiple times and it just stays on the loading screen?,just saw expert mode :loudly_crying_face: you can permanently enable it in the betaflight configurator settings
mine doesnt look like that at all in the setup page..?,https://www.expresslrs.org/assets/images/txprep-bw-internalRF.jpg. make sure your model is setup like that what does it look like this is problem: (It stays on the loading screen and doesnt change to anything) scroll down. until internal rf
"is it dented?. does it smell sweet, is it holding voltage?",yeahh that's done for It's at 22.2v now but It still works :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: discharge it safely outside
What would happen If I continue using it? Would it catch fire mid flight or?,"Or in your house, car, pocket. Fuck around and find out SEND IT (out of your domicile) Well you have lipo bags for that:PepeBigHmm: LiPo bags don't stop LiPo fires.... they only delay the inevitable. It'll probably explode somewhere along the way should make a 6s hug pillow of this"
They can leak out of the bag?,"LiPo fires fuel themselves. they don't need oxygen. LiPo bags are only good for transporting as they delay the fire breaking out of the bag. for storage at home you want an ammunitions canister sitting away from flammable stuff So I maybe should bring that batt threw TSA. Not ^^^ Yeah you need mass and insulation to soak and isolate the heat and release it slowly, and lipo bags don’t have the thickness needed"
Can I let the analog vtx connector soldered onto the fc? And put digital system onto the fc connector?. Or will it act as antenna,"Basically can I just disconnect the analog camera and vtx connector(s)   And let them soldered on, hanging loose.    And then plug in the o3 system and fly without problems"
i mean yea. you plan on switching back?,"Just taped em off.. Yes. ah ok, you confident at soldering or is this a super short term switch. oh looks like you waterproofed it Because this drone was clean analog like crazy, didn't plan to change anything.   But now I had to leave my o3 drone in Greece, and tomorrow I have to fly.   So if it doesn't make me crash, i don't care if there is some noise.. Yeah, I fly only above water and in windsurfers water spray oh i bet the video you get is incredible tho Yeah, O3 does a really really good job above the water and on this single subject. I don't really need the GoPro anymore:smirking_face:"
Hi y'all! I need some help with setting up an RX with Betaflight. Am i in the right place? (i think its an small question),i sure hope it is expresslrs
So i just got my reciever. An Frsky RS PLUS mini. I binded it with my TX (the Frsky X7). Now i got an Betaflight board. The DalRC F405.  I've hooked up `GROUND` and `VIN` first. That works.  Now i've soldered the `SBUS` from the RX to the port silkscreened `RC`. In Betaflight i went to the Reciever tab. Changed it to `serial` and `SBUS`. But i cant get input from my TX.  What am i doing wrong?. I probs missed a small thing.... Oh it works! I missed this switch...,"I do want to warn you Oh all the channels are wrong! Oeps xD If you just bought all this gear, you pretty much got scammed into purchasing gear that is at least 4 years out of date and probably way longer I got it for free from the RC plane club :slightly_smiling_face: Or at least, all the drone parts oh I meant the QX7 and FrSky stuff Never flown, he could not figure out how to configure it so it layed in the closed. Ahh. I upgraded from an Flysky (I6 iirc) to an Frsky X7. Was still an big upgrade (i got it for 70 dollars ish an year ago second hand). Very happy with it so i dunt complain haha started for fun, sometimes they give me a tip."
"When I arm and throttle the motors on the bench the motors won’t stop accelerating after some time, is this normal because of gyro correction or what do I have to fix?",its normal. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144568652809654272
got any videos of it?,Yes uploading it now! its cause you have the smoke stopped plugged in
Oh that thing in between the Lipo and drone?,Ah. Lemme see. IT WORKS! :red_heart:. thanksss
"yes, they would be bad, because theyre not flexible, itd be dangerous, ive asked myself this before, and i think no matter the filament, they would explode. emilia and leah explained it to me one time. sth about the layers tearing apart cause of the g force. also... why carbon fiber props?","was just an idea but thanks for helping me. another question are you guys also so often gertting sand in your motors because i do and you always cant really turn the motor anymore by hand and there is a sand crushing noise when doing so the only way i found was compressed air from a compressor because compressed air from a can isnt enough or am i doing something wrong It's actually fairly common for big props (like when you get to 20"" and bigger you see a lot of them). Also about the aerodynamics being fucked up when you have layers, and having terrible flexing if it does manage to not become shrapnel"
i was thinking that. what specific spot in your household should you charge it at? how long does it usually charge (im sure it depends on the battery but for my case lets do 850 maH) im gonna atleast have a fire extinguisher close to it,"I'm lucky enough to have a guest room where I have a dedicated charging spot, but otherwise I would do it anywhere not flammable or actually just right next to where you hang out or something"
hello guys  can anyone tell me if I can use GL300c rc on pc fpv sims ?,"fire extinguisher won't do anything unless it is specifically for LiPo's btw. if the company that produces the drones reccomends a battery maH that varies in a range, (for example Oddity rc reccomends 850mah~1100mah) what should i pick."
really? how bout a blanket or something,"anything in that range i have a concrete gym down stairs. I could possibly workout and get pumped while my battery also gets pumped. nope, LiPo fires fuel themselves... the fire burns the lithium and the lithium then catches on fire and repeat. hence the electric car fires are all so devastating"
i was anything in that range works  but are the differences tiny?. so then wtf do i do if it catches fire lol,"iv been tryin for tow days  to make it work but no luck you toss it out the window or you have it in like a metal ammo box. lol iv seen ppl do it but i couldn't alr so ill put some smithint gloves in that room to pick up the spicy battery. and maybe like a staineless steel disposal box big weight difference, if you're planning on carrying an action camera probably go on the smaller side battery-wise yeah I mean you can get primarily those. and then maybe get a single big one. just see what you end up liking"
Do you mean if anyone had a lipo fire ?,"my brother had my ds and tried to take the battery out with a knife. stabbed it open and went berserk. no one was hurt but lucky it went out quick. yes in this server or you have known not severe ones where the battery was still full how did they occur though.. im trying my best to never ever have one someone here a few years ago had a friend who charged them on the bedside table while sleeping. they lost their house. crash, the ones that happen in the house is usually a bad charger OR a battery that is unmonitored (say resistance values never looked at for example) In my case, it was because of me being dumb and shorting my battery when trimming the leads, which resulted in a kaboom, the rest was just me taking out the batteries with a sledge hammer when they started to get too old. And also one because I charged some 1s batteries at like 8c. That was fun LiPo fires that happen out of anything but pure neglect are insanely rare to the point you don't really have to worry"
ok ill never do something like that :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. do most lipi fires occur outside? like when a crash occurs?,"in this hobby yeah. you smack a battery into a pole and pop it goes. lol thats what i was worried about. like i was scared if i look at the lipo the wrong way itd get mad and just  burn my house down nahh they're not like scary crazy unstable things. at least the ones sold to us aren't. lol is that sarcasm. thank god I mean yeah if you are spectacularly dumb and do everything wrong (such as ; using a parallel board+over charging+charging too fast=fire), but not really in real life ya i just want to create a safe room for charging . one candidate might be my messy ass gym. those shelves will be taken out. anyways Just do it next to you so you can monitor them if you are paranoid you can get something like a batsafe box"
"i definitely will lmao. btw, been studying joshua bard wells vids and was wondering if LiftOff the drone sim is good?. looks quality to me but is there better options","it's a bit on the older side now. the developers haven't really updated it beyond weird machine learning stuff, it kind of depends on the workshop now. Velocidrone is still good and kicking around. whatever you choose it'll be fine and good enough for the skill to transfer over. even the goofy free ones i think ill use liftoff just for the joshua bardwell tutorial guide. then once i get through that 27 video course ill get something such as velocidrone The liftoff tutorial is actually pretty decent, that's what I used when I started, and you can also just stick with liftoff, for freestyle both will work about as well"
you shut the door the fire place?. https://youtu.be/Rv_3vwSZmzA?si=K5Yw26EkLtUAa4LJ heres a great video i just saw. im not sure if cheap ammo boxes would work the same though as a bat safe with is lime 75 bucks,smart lmao. im thinking ill by an ammo can and just put the hota in with the battery and charge it in a dry concrete room. props to this dude you need to remove part of the seal yea i saw that. id also have to figure out how to get the wires in. the ammo box would essentially be a bomb with the seal and no holes lmao. plus the fumes would be fucked up No my basement fireplace has extensive brickwork so I leave it in an ammo can in the corner.  It's mainly just being on the bricks vs being in furnace. It would still cause a boat load of smoke damage
if you would mind in the future could you send me a picture? no rush im just curious. I think i may do this too with an ammo can. how do you get the wires in their also?,Just an ammo can on bricks. Something that's made to control fire. Could be cookie baking pan
alright triple checking this is the controller with the right specifications id want for my Oddity rc cinewhoop?. just a radio master boxer. is this good?. buying it off amazon since i got 200 dollars worth of amazon credit,"i'm following up with my supposed vtx cooking itself after trying to power it on without the antenna, thankfully was not the case, i simply soldered the 5v wire to the wrong pad, it works! hi im new to fpv and i trying to find a drone i have already chosen walksnail x goggles and raidomaster boxer any advice (budget 200) nono. you want ELRS. not CC2500. <https://www.amazon.com/RadioMaster-EdgeTX-Remote-Controller-Gimbals/dp/B0DF4LW186/>"
"It is normal that my whoop rotates waaaaay slower in air mode compared to just plain acro? If so, what can I do to stop my drone ""tumbling"" when I throttle off for stunts without air mode?",i thought it was elrs…. OOH. im silly.. i didnt select the elrs module.
Then I suppose my next question would be: Why would my drone rotate way slower with air mode enabled?,good thing its not purchased yet the link I sent you is nicer 10 bucks cheaper here i believe
would you guys print this in tpu?https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4586225,the Boxer Crush is different from the normal Boxer. yes yea im thinking so too.. i crashed a broke my actual go pro case :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. oh well.... lets see how this goes.. supports are gonna be hard on that print. TPU supports are basically impossible to remove
you rpint it on its side ?. im pretty good :winking_face:,you'd have to use a knife or a heatgun to remove them
you're using an external vtx?,Where do I solder the Smart audio any TX pad. tx1 is near the vtx pads Ye the internal is dead then yeah a free tx pad. watch out for which uart the receiver is on
@Only Bans I made a suggestion about a micro drone channel in #feedback but the thing closed before I could answer your message. Does that mean it’s happening?? I don’t understand…,"It means that it's not happening and if you want a micro drone focused channel you should make a thread in #off-topic Why did he say it’s a good idea then. Also micro drones don’t belong into #off-topic (did a typo, I meant #off-topic-forums, but it could also be a thread in #fpv-drones ) he said a thread is a good idea, not a channel The part he responded to is unclear since he didn’t answer to a specific message which is why I am assuming that his message referred to the topic of the suggestion or the last message which also referred to make a separate channel I said a thread is a good idea. Its not specific enough for an entire channel when threads exist It does sound like that FC is toasted, having read your diagnostics. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:"
"Why take a picture of a phone screen? I get that computers are harder to screenshot and open discord to send, but taking a picture of a phone with assumingely another phone, why not just screenshot?",Check if you still have 5v and 3.3v crazy. that they didnt delete it by now. a least its not a full addy. leah has my fully addy
Does anyone know audio editing software?,"I know how to screenshot lmao. im buying it off my mothers phone as she is the one with the amazon wallet. I didnt have time to screenshot and send it to mine. cant believe you have the Audacity to ask that -# get it, cause audicty is an audio editing software"
ya ik . i deleted it the first time once you saw it. shouldve cropped it. heres it cropped. is this correct?,yes it is. I normally wouldnt buy it off amazon but my birthday passed a couple days and i was given a shit ton of amazon money. perhaps better spent on buying the charger on amazon. and other things that aren't super marked up on there
What the difference between F4 and F7 MCU's? Does it impact the experience?,"F405 has more flash space than F722. F722 is faster and has more UARTs, but limited flash space. resulting in the only software supporting F722 right now being Betaflight"
"What about the F435, F411, etc?","The ATF435 is faster than the F405 and can have more memory and UARTs, and it's also cheaper than the F405. Only supported by Betaflight right now because it's more or less a ""clone"" of STM32 products. F411 is slow, small memory and is only common in cheap/small stuff like tinywhoop AIO's"
"hey,  this might be a stupid question but like... i couldnt find anything abt it.. how do i know if my esc has telemetry? or do all of them just have it? (or i guess more like.. can send telemetry or whatever, cause im sure my drone has some sensors, its a tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle)",anything blheli_s or bluejay or blheli32 or am32 or anything will have telemetry. it's kind of required for the drone to function *well*
"hi all.. I'm new to drones and would like to build my own.. I'd like to carry some camera equipment, so I was wondering about the possibility of being able to carry ~3kg of extra weight and I'd like to be able to travel up to ~3km with it.. does that sound feasible/realistic?",well no... why would your transmitter need to know how fast your motors are spinning. and similar idk.. well telemetry is off in bf for me rn... i thought telemtry was mostly for like non-osd info on the drone well yes. but ESC telemetry is a different thing. ESC telemetry is telemetry... from the ESC
"cause this is what i have rn. so for telemtry to the radio i need to just enable it in the receiver tab, right?",okay lmao. thank you!. can't try it rn but my boxer should arrive later today

looks a bit weird doesn't it?,"ye lol :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: only relating image I can find is from aliexpress. yeah I don't think those are real. if you look on TrueRC's site all their X2-Air MK2's say their polarity on them on the back, not the logo. the only ones they make SPECIFICALLY for the Goggles 2 are the normal X-Air ye now that you mention that thing on the back your right. I missed that as well also I don't think they really ever have like exposed solder connections. especially not ones that look like that :red_heart: ty. saved me some money you might want to shoot TrueRC an email"
"what do u guys have set for failsafe in betaflight? i have drop rn, but tbh land seems like a more reasonable option, cause it gives more time to recover rx connection and stuff","It's kind of hard to tell if they messed up and connected soldered the center and gnd of the coax, but it does look like the ground is connected to the big pads, and the center is connected to the center bit And that's about how mine look. (Tho idk if they are genuine or not, never used Ali)"
"Oh you got the same ones? and it looks like that at the back?. The ones I am buying are from someone on Ebay. however I used the image off ali as its the only other comparison I could find,.","I just have drop, and in both cases you aren't getting the Rx connection back anyway. I have a different version but yeah, it does end at the middle with a ball of solder at the end like there huh.. yeah but for land i can set it to like 1k rpm and itll decend a bit slower.... than just.. drop Both cases it will end up on the ground yes but one of them slower lol, i can run towards it I can send you photos of the back of mines in a little while if you want to like my question is.. why i _shouldnt_ enable land... cause fall seems more dangerous for the quad aswell do not mess with the failsafe settings. they are dangerous What if the prop gets stuck and now you also have a dead esc they are in a hidden menu for a reason. and your tinyhawk won't break even if it falls from space. terminal velocity or whatever yeahh.. i guess the only real thing you would need it for is gps rescue on long range. truee tbh yes please :slightly_smiling_face:"

"yeah at least betafpv has okay batteries, the emax batteries SUCKKK. LMAOO probably. although i gotta say the frame is really sturdy and so are the props. im gonna try some gemfan hurricane 2520's tho. higher pitch props should give me a bit more thrust right?","i mean. betafpv lava is just tattu/greprow cells so.. they just.. resell batteries but shmingus. shmingus. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250. i have linked u this before shmingus yes but its not about 1s batteries, i use xt30 2s anyway. that is probably true. i have tattu and dogcom 650mah batteries for my tinyhawk pick up some gnb cells. or dogcom or tattu. yeah those i really like my dogcom and tattu lipos, gnb seems good but they probably take long af to deliver to europe guys quickly. dji mini 2 fly more. or normal dji mini 3. for photography/videography which one do you want idk im deciding between the two but i cant. come to a decision. lookin for others' inputs do u need the stuff that comes with the fly more kit"

Which Setting should i take for my gps?,Usually u just set the bitrate to auto and let the GPS and FC handle that. Make sure u are on at least BF 4.5.0 and u are using the latest configurator There has been a major change/improvement regarding GPS Check the log. Might be something obvious
you mean the Protokoll?,"Protokoll = Log , yes I can't do anything with it"
Its complaining about this. I dont know why u have that in there. What FC do u have?. I already told u that,It’s written in the Manuel. iFlight SucceX-E F722 V1.4 so i have to add that in the Betaflight config
What?. If u dont understand the english text just say it,Ok tell me in your own words what the text i highlighted means The BF 4.5 supports IST8310
Correct. So since it supports it u dont need the parameter :winking_face:. So delete the definition and try again to flash. Did it work now?,"yes it worked but my gps symbol in the top right corner does not light up Im about to go to bed but make sure u have a battery plugged in, a fan blowing at your FC, ESC and VTx so they dont overheat Also u must configure the ports tab with the right UART and enable GPS at the configuration tab.

An the R4 and T4 should Go to Same R4 and T4 from my FC?,RX goes to T4 TX goes to R4 This GPS wiring is crap :grinning_face_with_sweat: it's just uart for the gps and i2c for the compass. plus power
Hi y'all. Question. Does the VTX work when not configured in Betaflight?,"It is standard, just with SDA and SCL for compass/barometer. Yes it works of course, you just won't be able to change the power/channels from your OSD menu, Betaflight Configurator or BF Lua Script on your EdgeTX Controller. It will output video if it has power and video signal from camera Hmm okey! Yeah im getting the goggles in about 2 hours from delivery and wanted to make sure im ready to rock!"
Which VTX do you have?,"Lumenier TX5GS. And then the Foxeer Predator V4 mini camera. With an Lumenier AXII 2 antenna. (yeah older type, i got it for free from someone) Just don't turn it on without antenna. That will burn it Hmm check. I installed an Lumenier AXII 2 antenna! Also good you mentioned it, i did not know that! (first time FPV for me xD) Any radio transmitter that gets powered up without an antenna has a good chance of getting fried.  The energy from the amplifier has nowhere to go without the antenna to transmit it, so it bounces back into the amp. The amp gets hotter and hotter till it pops."
"I got an basic FPV goggle, the EMAX transponder. Like 60 euros (55 dollars iirc). Very basic but didnt want to spend to mutch on the first try.  It has auto channel search, so that's nice right?",nah. most of the time they're pretty bad
The goggles or channel search?,"I wouldn't use auto channel search Well, from there the only way is up, at least. :Harold: Goggles are fine for the price I think, but I never had them both but specifically auto channel search I surely dont expect to mutch of the goggles tho. If i like FPV drone freestyle i will buy an better one. Hmm check! channel search will stop at the first channel with an image. but there's some overlap so it might find something but it's not the right channel im not sure if they have auto channel search.. i have the emax transporter 2's and they can scan one channel ""automatically"" but you have to set which one @cyberFluke Thank you for the info"
"Oh, so it wont find the optimal channel the VTX sends out to but just the first one it sees?","Set the channel through betaflight (configure SmartAudio or Tramp telemetry) and then set your goggles to the same channel. Basically Unless you're really far from the VTX and the signal is weak, it will not know the exact channel. It's analog. One way communication most of the time you'll find something but as soon as you fly away the signal goes to absolute dogshit"
"Would you guys help me to configure it?  If yes, i will first drop some drawings so you guys know how i wired it up","The goggles can't talk to VTX, only the VTX can output video well the vtx only sends on one channel at a time so better to set it correctly manually Yes, sure thing!. However I would create a thread in #help-with-drones  for this Fair, going to do that!"
@cyberFluke sir i want to ask is it possible to have automated charging of drone ? Eg.Drone comes autonomoulsy on a aruco marker and somehow(my question) connects its self to charging port of lipo to charger and fly offwhen charging is compeleted.,"afaik the VTX only sends on one channel and the emax transporters just scan a channel that you can select, so you dont have to manually scan it by pressing a button, but idk... Umm that might be possible, but it will require some engineering and probably not just a regular LiPo charger I mean, nothing is impossible, but there's no ""hobby grade"", off the shelf solution that I'm aware of.  Commercial level stuff, sure, but we're talking about a big bucket of £££ for stuff of that ilk."
@cyberFluke@Yaros  money will no prob my institute will cover all I just wanna ask that how it is possible . Should I custom craft a battery for this purpose and should i custon craft automatic hole finding charger for the battery?,"You will probably need to get some charging board for LiPos, regular chargers like ToolkitRC. I looked for BMS boards online for Lithium batteries, but they do not support large currents that drones need. The craft should run Ardupilot to have precise control with GPS, Compass and Barometer, Betaflight won't do that Gimme a day or two in fusion and I could probably knock up the bones of some sort of dock that would align a custom power connector on the drone with one on the dock. Likely need a couple of pokey servos on some sort of grab cradle controlled by whatever is the current equivalent of a black pill board. (It's been a while)  Probably have it physically cut the drone to LiPo connection on dock somehow, make the charging simpler. itd probably have to be som kind of platform the drone can land on, that has li-ions with coils or sth under it, the drone would have to have some pins at the bottom so when it lands, it can touch the surface and charge, so itd be like a conduction charger It's doable. But it's not a quick and easy task. There's a lot of angles to consider here. Ive made the post in #help-with-drones ! but yeah, i think the best bet would be a conductive platform that the drone can land on, the drone would have like contacts on the bottom so that it connects to the charging pad. but theres a lot of engineering behind it if you wanna diy it. theres actually something exactly like that, that already exists. check this out @hero <https://www.skycharge.de/technology> Thank you everyone for replying and giving valuable information"
do you guys know of any radios that are around the size of a TX12 but with full-size gimbals?,"Radiomaster Boxer/Boxer Crush. I got my Boxer Crush 3 days ago and it has AG01 gimbals, I love it @Vitroid What do you think of the r/FPV forum, you're really active in it."

It freezes on the DJI screen when you start it. Check the DJI forums for an updated version of the DJI fly app I wonder if you realise just how hot those VTX's get :face_with_tears_of_joy:
"would it be thermal throttling? i dont have a temp readout from it but it hasnt felt hotter than like, 80c after a flight","Thermal throttling is one issue. the plastic is another i havent seen any deformation under the vtx or near the stack, its tpu so its fairly resilient"

"So, and if a stack has M3 holes, it's not compatible, right?. It is vx3.5","Well, you answered your own question. Even if it doesn't show the stack screws only the frame screws. But it looks like a vx3 Nah. The vx3.5 also only allows m2 stack mounting Well, the stack will have, like, M5 holes, and an assortment of gummies in m2 and m3 Almost all the times an m3 stack will have an m4 hole and m3 gummies, I never had a single m3 fc or esc that also shipped with m4->m2 gummies"

I assumed it was a fpv drone u wanted help with.. Have ensured you are recording in 4k"
"Drones similar to that, you as the user need to ensure you have manually selected the format you want to record in.. If you haven't selected 4k settings may be the default 634?","I'll check that out this morning, thanks a lot. I'll keep you posted."
is this HS1720G a holy stone drone?,"!toy. it probabyl cant record in 4k is my guess I see videos on YouTube and the guy records well in 4k it might be possible, idk about this drone specifically, but in general holy stone drones aren't high end like a DJI drone. yeah I would check the settings and see if 4k is an option and if it actually looks like 4k I think if I show you a video I made with it, you'll fall on the floor! I don't know, I'll look in the settings but even on Amazon, I don't have the same quality as on the reviews when you're connected to the drone, tap on the three bars under the photo button and then press on the triangle in the square and make sure the 4k 30fps option is selected I will look at that thanks"
"Hello, I bought crux3 and installed 3 blade propeller. The official tune doesn't work . It wobbels while throttling and had other problems to. Is there a tune for that?",use the original props. 3 blade is not suited for 1s 3inch
"These antennas don't make sense for tinywhoops, right? https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/boxer-accessories/products/bandit-t-antenna","well, i think itd be overkill, if you only fly in close proximity, but you could defninitely just keep it on your radio I'm probably gonna buy the Radiomaster Boxer (https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/boxer-radio-controller-m2), the Crush version, which I saw on the FAQ sidebar. Too bad the specifications of the default Antenna aren't mentioned. oh nice :) i have a radiomaster boxer crush on the way rn, sadly the shipping is delayed but i cant wait to have it, definitely a good choice. i think this is the standard T antenna that they ship with <https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/2-4ghz-t-antenna>"
But should i let it cool down between flights?. How hot is too hot?,"Is it normal that my motors get almost too hot to touch the bells on 1750kv 6s. 5 inch. It’s really sunny outside and like 30 degrees celcius so idk if that helps lol That is riding the line, but maybe not surprising given the ambient temp That'd be ideal. My rule is if they're too hot to touch, they're too hot and you need to figure out why Ok. But i feel like 1750 kv on 6s is pretty low What’s the best fpv flight sim 30C is hot outside, but not crazy, so there may be something else contributing to the heat buildup in the stator I’d say for most people liftoff or uncrashed Idk my prop pitch. That could be the cause ig So lift off or uncrashed which one is cheaper Idk you choose. I use uncrashed Could also be your tune, or how much time you spend at high throttle, any of these are contributing factors. That's easy to lookup. I'd add Velocidrone to your list. Not much high throttle, lot of slow cruising and default tunes Might need to work on your PID and filter tunes then. It'd be worth looking at a blackbox log Ok. Will do when i get the chance. Also. Can i fly 6s batteries down to 21 volts. Flat. Or is it better to stop at around 21.5 Yes that is where I would land, at 21V"
is it better to have 2 medium gain directional antennas or 1 omnidirectional and 1 directional antenna on analog goggles?. ev800ds,"i would definitely not get only directional ones, cause then you wouldnt really be able to fly behind yourself, 1 omni and 1 directional sounds good tho"
what if you point one of them backwards and one forwards?,"hm well depends on the angle of the antennas, but youll always have some blind spots i think. especially with only 2 of them yeah probably, 2 110 degree antennas would leave 2 70 degree blindspots on your left and right sides"
Velocidrone is the better of all the available sims at the moment. It's the closest to realistic that you'll get.. Honestly? It's not worth changing the antennas on the ev800d.  You'd be better off putting that cash towards better goggles.,I’ve bought uncrashed guys Nice. Graphics are great
"what do more expensive goggles do better than the ev800ds? im only flying analog because i dont want to spend the money for digital now or in the future, my only complaints are that they're pretty bulky and the headstrap sucks, but im designing a custom strap rn anyway so that's kind of moot. my current analog setup costs 85$ on amazon, cheapest digital setup i could find was like 200","Well, better analog goggles (the only better option that's not dramatically more expensive is the cobra x v2) will give better range/penetration, better comfort (sometimes), better screen, better lenses, better i/o (sometimes)"
wouldn't the range be determined by the antennas it comes with? its really the only thing im concerned with rn. i dont think the lenses or resolution matter too much for 480p video lol,"In parts, but the receiver also matters a lot. It kinda does and my flying skill hasn't caught up with a need for high resolution anyway. id still hit the branches even if i could see them It's like saying that your driving skills don't require you to have premium leather seats yet. Cause digital is just leather seats in a car"
"if that's the comparison then i def don't need it, what goggles have the best budget receiver then?","For analog, the cobra x v2 is the best for the money, anything better is a few hundred bucks more. And the receiver inside is as good as it gets. (well, the rapidfire is a bit better, but not by that much)"
also would it not be possible to just upgrade the receiver? id imagine the display would be compatible with any analog output,"You can't upgrade the receiver in the ev800d, you can on the cobra x v2 if you wanted to, but there's not real need for it"
why not? if it means cutting up the case and resoldering stuff that's fine,Afaik it's baked on the board directly in the ev800d
"what, like it shares the same pcb with the power module and display drivers? thats fine, i'd cut it out of the pcb and just resolder any missing connections. though i doubt the screen would be inoperable if the reciever is just disconnected","Sounds like some prime #diwhy content, and I can't really help you to do that the other option is to just look for a used set of better goggles, but the first option is more fun. its like surgery, but the hippocratic oath doesn't exist Unless you are very skilled at IC work, I'd say trying to hack in a second receiver to work with the EV800D is... Problematic.. Besides, let's just look at the cost. The EV800D are $100-$120. The Cobra X V2 are $250, but they come with a Steadyview X receiver which is $120 on its own. So if you buy the EV800D and a Steadyview X module, we'll that's $240 right there and a huge pain in the ass to make them work together.. So, I guess unless you truly hate yourself, it makes no fiscal sense at all to do what you're suggesting well im gonna try this, stole these off a router. they look cool, bug mode. no idea what the gain is. flew 3 bats around my yard, no further than like 20 m, and the video quality is indistinguishable from the stock antennas lol. long range is probably worse, but i  can just plug in the directional one for that"
What's your issue here ?,"Your comment is horseshit. It's not really. I mean, except for racing, in the case of freestyle, digital is a luxury not a need ""Having a windscreen that you can see out of is the same as leather seats."" waffles try to not only engage in conflicts You can see perfectly fine with analog, I fly both analog and digital You are allowed but only if you side with me"
"""Perfectly Fine""? Dude, that's just plain wrong.  Even with a signal that's clear as a bell, analog is objectively awful.","Dude, I fly analog 50% of the time, I think I can still trust my eyeballs It's *passable*, sure, but that's not the same as ""perfectly fine"". it is fine. you're not blind flying analog, so its fine It is tho, I know you don't like me, but that's not a reason to argue over nothing digital is better, but not needed Digital isn't even playing the same game as analog, let alone in a higher league. We didn't say the contrary, all we said is that analog is fine, and digital is a luxury, not a necessity"
"Digital isn't some luxury anymore. It's only slightly higher in cost, for an absolutely gamechanging difference in being able to see WTF you're doing.. Analog is what, 360p?","Ignoring the fact it's always got interference. 2x as much or more isn't slightly higher. and that's for the vtx, nevermind headsets"
2x as much as what? The cheapest possible headset that functions?. Using the ev800d as the benchmark is just silly.. How much are the skyzone jobbies that don't suck?,"I don't really care that you think it doesn't look great (besides, all systems will have interference), the fact is that you can see what's Infront of you with analog, thus it's fine, digital will let you see it better but it's not required to have a good flying experience. (Except if you can't handle the analog breakup but that's another story) Goggles L are 200, cheapest WS kit is 70-90 and the Cobra X are 250. Analog is completely unusable on cheaper goggles for me, higher end goggles is still awful.. Digital isn't a luxury anymore, or at the very least won't be soon. The **ever present** breakup. You are glossing over that really thickly. The vtx are still quite a bit more expensive even if the goggles are about the same prive. I did mention it  > (Except if you can't handle the analog breakup but that's another story)"
A decent analog VTx is how much?,"50 buckaroos. 20 for a camera You can get a unify for like 40$ iirc, plus 30$ for a ratel 2 I didn't say you didn't mention it, I said you're severely downplaying it's significance. aymeric will tell you he has just learnt to ""fly through it"" Not really, it doesn't stop you from seeing if you don't go too far away, and we aren't talking about the range, minor breakup isn't that big of a deal for most people i like disposable hardware, no risk when crashing. until digital is the same price as analog, ill stick with slightly above the cheapest"
"Yet to see him fly anything at all thus far, except the one he lost. (While flying analog?) :KEKw:","I mean, I often have full static and just fly through it and it's fine, you just need to know how to fly through it, I won't really mention it here tho or else cyberfluke will tell me not everyone can do that we get that you don't know how money works in relation to drones...

16S? Where are you reading that?. It's only capable of 1-6S. That is not a lipo setting,"Hota d6 pro writes i can charge 1s to 16s but on i can charge 6s maximally on ch1 how can i go higher (nimh for Example) I typed nimh for Example. Or other batteries also. Go more than 6s+. I am curious if it even can do 7s or more and how its because nimh only charges up to 1.5v, *16 = 24V max but you can't balance charge 16S You cannot charge lipo batteries greater than 6S. Other battery chemistries can be charged at high cell counts because the cell voltage is lower. A 6S lipo charges to 25.2V, but a 16S Pb battery is 24V Oh ye that what i was asking so you can maximally balance 6s and charge 16s(without proper balancing). Thanks"

The confusion often arises because the U.FL connector is sometimes referred to as an IPX or IPEX connector, which are just alternative names used by different manufacturers. >  > So, if your Meteor85 VTX uses an IPX connector, you can directly replace it with an antenna that has a U.FL connector without any issues.

Are ag01 gimbals overkill?,"Should I change the prop Not a good idea unless you setup a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with some credible sources of information. GPTs can give you  right information, or  somewhat right information or hallucinations. Only if you're trying to capture smooth video and it's oscillating like garbage an LLM will just give you something that sounds like it makes sense. There just so happens to be enough of this info out there to have that one list of words happen over and over... I wouldn't rely on it at all I use capable LLMs in coding (like the Claude 3.5), the use case in question is 'translation' Its translates your ideas and logic from English to a programming language. works well for me, and it will work for anyone who can provide proper context. Context is everything.. If someone uses LLMs as a replacement for Google search, god help them I use Copilot pretty much daily, usually for the boring tasks that have thousands of lines up on the internet already. When used correctly for the correct tasks, the models are great. They're expensive, but I wouldn't say they're overpriced i wouldnt say so, if you have the money for it, theyre very good Right. 'When used correctly' is the point. Many people don't write proper prompts. They just input a few keywords and expect LLMs to do the magic."

I have an issue that I cannot solve. I am running a custom designed frame that just got frabricated. Its running an AIO which is rotated 45 degrees to make it more compact and make the usb port more accessible. I have also calibrated the accelorometer and ensures everything is secured properly. For some reason the quad drifts to one side and I need to give it a slight input to hold it in position. What's strange is that on the bf config when the drone if facing away the roll is set to 0.0 but when i rotate it any other way the roll goes as far as 4.3 degrees and pitches slightly. What is the solution to this?,"can 1203 motors carry a 40 gram frame the frame isn't the most important thing here, prop kv voltage and use case as well as auw would be more important in this case 4850kV, 3s, and tri blades. but I can go to 4s the *size* of the prop, and the *Specific name of the prop* that's going to be a rather low kv for 3s, and a very high kv for 4s, you should look for a about 4000-4500kv motor for 4s, and 1203 is going to be tiny for this prop, you would be much better off with a 1404 motor"
"also, what's the auw on this quad ?","I was just wanting a new frame for my 3"" toothpick. what's that i think youre in the EU, i wouldnt buy from Radiomaster themselves cause of huge VAT and taxes, ended up being lik 80 bucks in just that for me (if youre not EU, and im mistaken, just buy from Radiomaster) all up weight, also if it's a toothpick, then the answer changes (kind of why I asked you the *use case* and *auw*), you would want some 1303 5000kv motors on 3s, and a 40g frame is excruciatingly heavy for a toothpick banggood is okay, but i would just buy from EU shops (auw is weight of the quad + battery) it's 60g dry. 110 with a battery also, for a toothpick, you should also get some 3018-2. ok, that's fine for a 3"" 3s toothpick, but don't get a 40g frame for it, that's super heavy, a decent 3"" toothpick frame (for a 3s toothpick)  should be like 10g oh. it's a toothpick, but a school bus style frame then it's not a toothpick... it's two different class of quads, if you use a dumb heavy frame, you loose all the advantages of a toothpick while having none of the advantage of a classical schoolbus quad because you would be using tiny motors that won't make enought thrust"
are 1800kv motors with 4s batteries underpowered for 5 inch props?,most definetly. 1800 is 6s kv
"figured, i chose them because i didn't trust the esc cause its a speedybee, it claims to be rated for 55a 6s but i dont believe it. what would be the correct rating?","That depends on the exact mosfets used, the rate and temperature of airflow over the board, and the desired duration of sustained current."
Are the PID sliders an ineffective way to tune your quad?. I finally got my toothpick to run on 3s without throbbles but on things like dives it tends to use a lot of throttle and it doesn’t fall as fast/straight as I hoped it would. Also it’s fast af. I’d say it’s got a comparable weight to power ratio to a 5 inch 6s. I’m very impressed,"No, but what you're describing is air mode and dynamic idle keeping your attitude on a, presumably, very light build Sounds like it's got A) too high of an idle B) too much PD C) insufficient filtering (be it gyro or RC input) D) just too much power for the weight class"
"I agree with A and D only because I understand what those do lol, but I think you’re right. What’s a good source for me to learn about filtering from?","B) - P and D are components of the PID controller, and each has its own coefficient (for each axis, and D can have a range instead of a single value) Ok I’ll try lowering those a tad first"
"C) - the angular data measured by the gyroscope is noisy. Betaflight filters that noise out to the best of its ability. Overpowered builds often generate extra noise.  Are you using RPM filtering and if so, is the motor pole count set up correctly?","Ohh gotcha. I started with a 3in toothpick preset that had filters built in and messed with the sliders from there so it wouldn’t get throbbles Yeah consider moving the sliders so that P and D go lower So I’m guessing the filters will need a bit of tweaking after. Ok actually there's an F)  it could be I Term Windup caused by a slight case of B/C. ""I"" term is responsible for long-term corrections. it accumulates and corrects for long term errors (like a weaker motor, poor balance, wind, etc). it can end up accumulating in a way that causes a raised idle. PID tuning is not simple lol Nah I’ve been putting it off for a long time Basically:  See if reducing PD or adding More Filtering helps Ok, I’ll lower the idle if that doesn’t work Too much D tends to sound like chirping"
Or should I start with that?,"be careful with idle, if you go too low you'll get desyncs. idk if you're running static or dynamic idle I’ll have to double check. It’s not on the latest bf yet. It’s at least a year behind"
"eh, is it 4.3+?. dynamic idle got overhauled in 4.3.","I’ll just update it and start fresh. I don’t have time today to mess with it but I’ll let you know if it worked later this week dooon't. make a backup. if it's 4.3+, you can bring most of the settings over to 4.5. incl tune. some settings have changed names I always make backups lol how rare. anyway, there is not a major difference in flight behaviour between 4.3 and 4.5 I learned watching j63 fuck up a completely fine build after an update lol so if it's 4.3, you don't need to bother too much. If it's 4.2, then you want to upgrade to get better dynamic idle.... but the PIDs will not transfer over. iirc. Anyway. Try the idle first. Or, if the motors get hot, do PD/Filters first Will do :PepePants:. Cya later I gotta do some shopping Hot motors = too much D or not enough Filtering (or in rare cases too much P). OR forgot to apply ELRS RC preset :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
where does the red wire go? on the other end I mean... @LAKIDUBS,In dire need of some help.. re soldered some wires that came loose on caddx vista unit... Now im jot getting any power to the unit. This was a hand me down and im not the best with soldering so dont judge :grinning_face_with_sweat:. Yellow is connected to rx1 and white is connected to tx1  from the video i was watching i think they got reversed from previous owner They have it soldered straight to the pigtail... This thing is like frankenstein
and where does the black wire go?. ok I finally found a pinout for this damn stupid board. ok so it goes to GND. what voltage is the battery you're testing it with at? @LAKIDUBS,Not a fully charged one but 15.2
do you own and know how to operate a multimeter?,"Dont have one unfortunately. Need to invest in one now for sure why do people always skip the pre-requisites for this hobby xD. the PRE is there for a reason Its the last thing im missing okay :loudly_crying_face: you're supposed to own one before buying a drone :face_with_tears_of_joy:. yeah anyway you'll need one. you need to check the voltage that's getting to the power pads on the vista Alright alright you win ill go buy one tomorrow morning be careful to not short out either of the probes against the case of the vista. or each other. you'll be working with raw battery voltage Its just weird that it was working fine prior to this basically, I want you to check for a broken wire. if there's 15V on one side of the wires. but significantly less than that on the other side of the wires. then you have a bad wire somewhere. you could also just replace the wires. but then you'd still need to verify that those wires aren't broken :KEKw:. and that the GND pad isn't toast on the FC (could be a burnt trace) Got it. Ill tag you when i get the multimeter with results. Thank you :folded_hands:"
"Do you know how to operate a multimeter?. Just checking.... When buying one, buy one that has a continuity checker function (that makes a beep)  there are ones that don't have it or have it only show on the screen instead of beeping f*ing pain. If it is a multimeter with multiple ways to connect the prongs, connect them in the configuration that's correct for measuring Volts/volts DC.  Make sure to put the multimeter in volts DC measurement mode.  DC = line with dots below or above it. In volts measurement mode, the multimeter acts like a cut wire. It can't really short anything out.  In other modes (amps, ohms, ...) it will act as a connected wire, so it will short stuff out.  Just warning because I've seen people blow stuff up by thinking ""oh, let's measure the amps too""",Pretty much everything i know right there aside from the continuity checker function. Thanks again ! Continuity checker/tester is very useful for making quick connection checks I may head out now to try and find one hah. I'm going to bed now Gn keep ya posted :folded_hands:
looks like a generic toy.. why you asking?,when in doubt *hydraulic press* Hey guys. Does anyone know the drone from syma x5hw Because I have that but it doesn't ascend like it doesn't even take off. It can't lift from the floor. Even though the batteries are fully charged. Is that a drone problem or what
Do I need a parallel charging board to charge 2S (XT30 connector) batteries with the HOTA D6 Pro AC?,!toy. You need XT60 to XT30 adapters
This will do the trick too I guess: https://www.banggood.com/HGLRC-Lipo-Battery-Balance-Charger-Board-Pro-40A-XT60-XT30-Plug-2-6S-Integrated-with-Lipo-Discharger-for-IMAX-B6-ISDT-Q6-Nano-HOTA-D6-Pro-P6-p-1976596.html?cur_warehouse=CN,Yes but no. Don't use a parallel charging board unless you absolutely know what you're doing I actually got that drone. Idk a lot of years ago. Havent used it in years though I'll make sure I know what I'll be doing Just get two XT60-XT30 adapters. Cheaper and a lot safer to begin with that alone says you dont
So I should buy the triple blade ones ?,"What's your opinion on it. Also the which propellers should I purchase. Like is any of them better for the drone There are 3 things to look at in a drone. Size (diameter of prop), pitch (the angle and how much air is moved), and blade count. Overall, a higher number pitch or blade count will lead to more power, so higher punch, but less battery efficiency. Smaller numbers will give you more flight time, more efficiency, but less power Bi blades can have the same power as tri blades if you adjust the pitch, besides more blades is not always more power even with similar pitch, quad blades will often feel somewhat stuck compared to a triblade. And at low rpm, more blades can be more efficient Well, that’s what I was told when I was learning about props. Often people go with tri blade tho cause it’s kinda just in the middle of everything"
"Where to buy fpv drone kit or set with googles in India?  I searched a lot on the web but all the possible options are really expensive and the cheap ones won't ship to India... Also, are those cheap Chinese made 2k rs drones good enough to start learning?. I have flown rc planes before but never a drone",Move out of India seems to be the only reliable way unfortunately.  Your locale is well known round these parts for being one of the worst for FPV gear. Looking for a place next to brussels that sells drones / drone apparature. I'm looking for a battery 250mAh 4.35V for a Mobula 6/7 fpv drone. Delivery times online are several weeks. Any related / unrelated help is welcome. Thank you
Should one buy spare VTXs for tinywhoops? How fragile are they?,"Its not a very good drone, it wont take very spectacular pictures. It does not fly well with a little bit of wind. It’s basically unusable with a little bit of wind. But I guess if it’s your first drone and don’t have a lot of experience it does work. Because it’s very cheap"
Is it safe to charge Tattu RLine batteries with 2C current?,"I've done it before. Even more. Just, 2C is a charge rate, not current. You calculate the current from the charge rate and capacity. Yeah, for me it's 1.4Ah * 2 = 2.8A"
Gimbal arm is broke in the half and the cable is a bit ripped. Should be like 50-100$. How you crashed it ?,50-100 to repair or are you saying you'd pay 50-100 to buy it. I didnt. Bought it crashed. Came with touchscreen controller too Fixing it up rn. Camera itself and all of its cables are fine. Actually functionally everything seems fine. Just the plastic is broken. Gps ribbon cable was also ripped. 150 With case. Oh really. Great I’d send it to dji. They’ll give you new drone Wouldn't fixing it be cheaper
they do that for second hand owners? no way,"If the only 1 cable is broken and the plastic , it should be like 50-80$. Yeah. No , they have the cheapest parts and you’ll get just new drone Yeah , that what i did with my mavic 2 pro Hope I didn't void their warranty by ripping it all apart It doesn’t matter. Just send it for service unless you broke it even more you cant void it I didnt. Dang guess I'm gonna send it to them When they will give you new m3 Pro you’ll have warranty on the new one Might aswell. Too many errors to fix yeahh youre not fixing that yourself What makes you say that it doesnt even detect there being a GPS. which i assume you didnt remove Yeah , i bought my mavic 2 Pro for 500$ sent it for service for 100-150$ and i have full new mavic with controller for 600-650$ Yea cause the ribbon cable was ripped. So I took it out. If you paid 100-150$ service. Hmm I paid that much because its mavic 2 pro"
Oh it's more expensive?,Way more expensive and bigger than mini series. Yeah. Also i sent charger and controller. Because i wanted new one. So i asked them to replace batteries. They are too lazy to open the controller and resolder all the batts :KEKw:
"Hi everyone,  Is anyone here familiar with older stacks (F4V3s)? I recently bought a used (and broken) drone, and someone gave me an old stack. I've desoldered the old flight controller, but the new ESC has three pads for the motor/ESC wires. However, I’ve got five wires coming out of the esc: three thick ones (red, blue, and black) and two thinner ones (another red and black). Can I still connect this?","I don't even think the batts are soldered on If you want , then even send the controller , for batt replacement. They should give new one Nah not worth it. Old owner flew only 1h with it. Batts probably fine I didn’t mean batts are weaker , I mean if you’ll sent this controller for batt replacement , they’ll just give you new one Yea maybe. I just gotta log out of this guys acc Too much effort for them to resolder batts"
Is the mini 3 pro the latest model?,"Oh. Damn wish I had that. I hope 3 pro is still good tho You can send M3 pro for service to get new one , and then sell as new one. For much more Ur right. Im gonna check how much service will cost. Hopefully they also let me even do it. Since I'm the second owner"
"Aww Mann, and what about the drones that are being sold here, the Chinese ones that cost like 30$ RTF but supposedly have a 4k camera and can send live feed to a mobile phone through wifi?   Are those even real?. Or any more expensive version of this?","Real, but absolute crap. it's all just cheap toy-grade stuff"
"Hmm. So India sucks. Btw, i wanted to ask, I have the FS-i6X and FS-i6 remotes with me. And plenty of servos, motors and esc's, not the real ones, the orange Chinese ones :face_with_crossed-out_eyes:  Could I make a drone out of this stuff?. And what would be the right channel to discuss all this as I know I am sounding pretty annoying rn","this is the correct channel for getting help. you'd need a proper flight controller to build a multicopter, but you can use a PWM receiver to make an RC plane"
"The controller, the frame and few extra motors as can't trust em can we  But idts this would really help me get into fpv. Could you elaborate please?","These kind of quads aren't made to be good at flying, but just to eventually let someone learn two things about drones, they aren't worth spending money on them, you would be much better off just getting an actual fpv quad, cause this above is just a bunch of cheap crap that will fly like crap and basically uses bottom of the barrel components"
"Yep. Totally agree. But I don't have any other choice, than to spend idk 500$ on ebay to get a kit shipped to me lmao..  Should I just stick to planes? If so how can I attach fpv to a plane?  I have read stuff about AIO's and watched a  flitetest vid on the topic but couldn't quite get the hang of it..  I just want to experience how it feels to fly while you are still on the ground yk..","I mean, 500$ is a pretty normal price to start with in fpv, see #deleted-channel , but to add fpv to a plane, just stick a camera and vtx inside and buy some goggles"
Can someone please confirm that “SMA straight” means “SMA male” and “SMA angle” → “SMA female”? https://shop.prodrone.pl/en_US/p/Xtreem-Cross-goggles-SET/399?currency=EUR,"No, that just is asking if you want the antenna to come straight out the connector, or at an angle I'm a beginner so I'm 50/50 on this being ironic :p actually means that, angle and straight are male in this case"
"oh yeah  i tried to RTH today and it seemed like it just flew up and was going away from me?. home point was set close to me, but it was going away from it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCEqR26-a6Y&list=LL&index=7. i followed this almost exactly. i let it land once and it worked pretty well. iirc i got the flyfish m10q he mentions in the video. i think the only thing i changed was i lowered my hover value a bit cause i have high kv,"i feel like most people dont know what irony is oh shit its prolly cuz i was not 15m away. i need to go to a bigger field.... local park is tinny. shit i forgot to record DVR ive been recording DVR on all my flights so that I can replay it to see where I crashed if I lose it lol. i did the gps rth test in my neighborhood but it was kinda sketchy. its nervewracking because the quad doesnt fly itself off video so it doesnt bother to orient the camera in a way that you can see where the quad is going. i cant get the xf telem to work with my old opentx version and I cant be bothered to update it, but I did learn I can record a gps log file via wifi telem on my phone which is cool but also a pain"
Do you know the reason that the camera doesn't send any image like it crates a WiFi connection but it just lights up a static green light and a red blinking one. But it doesn't display anything do you know why?,"I don't know why, sorry"
those cheaper toy grade drones are really hit or miss on quality. how long have you had it? the batteries may not hold a charge if theyre old,"And as for the LED question, best you can do is check the manual O have had for many many years. The batteries are good how do you know the batteries are good I bought them. Aftermarket"
do you have a charger to see the internal resistance?,"if it cant lift off the ground, usually the batteries are toast or the motors are toast"
or the amount of mAh input?,"he wont have any of those stats lol so you dont know if they're good, really, the only metric you have is flight time I was just wondering if I could get a little picture. That's right and it doesnt fly :loudly_crying_face: :face_with_tears_of_joy: i thought you said it wouldnt lift off the ground Yes I had just placed the blades wrong so they were pulling air instead of pushing"
I have a 12v flywoo LED strip. If I power it through a 10v pad will it shine less bright or just not work at all?,i would guess it will be only slightly less bright. cant hurt to try
"Quick question, can I replace one tinywhoop motor with a higher kv? One of my 0802 motors broke in a 65mm whoop, and I can't find the exact motor anywhere, only higher kv ones. The original motors are 14000kv made for 2s and the only ones I can find where I'm looking are 25000kv. Main question is, assuming they weigh the same, would 3 14000kv motors and 1 25000kv motor work together?","generally no. well, I'm sure betaflight might handle it but it won't be happy"
where does it suggest that. https://caddxfpv.com/products/walksnail-avatar-hd-mini-1s-kit?srsltid=AfmBOooV0uz73KhF0gAKzPN6lVUISkkuLcwTHvFWliLOeZ9U4qxMzp7E this just says 3.1 to 13v. i guess it wont stress your 5v regulator as much. if you use batt,"from betafpvs site. I wonder if the bec can't provide enough for it thats what im thinking. no harm in just using batt, and it wont stress your 5v reg. may even be cleaner signal idk how all that works. probably wont matter. havent had any drop outs so seems all good. the folded cell batteries are amazing with sag If you have Dji care , they will take broken one and give you new one Idk if the previous owner bought it, but it just let me buy the renew after I put in the sn It doesn’t work like that. You need to have fully working drone. To buy it"
No?. The owner can buy it within 72 hours of buying the drone,It lasts 1-2 years and u have 2 renews available if u crash
Yeah. So owner had Dji care ?,I'm assuming cause otherwise it wouldn't let me even go through with the process. I even got a label already
You mean shiping label ?,Yes. I'm just really worried they will take it then some issues will arise and they won't give a new one or the old one back
It would let you go through the process. Wait. Do this drone have dji care ?,"I don't know. But it said ""active"". On something Add this drone to your account and show me pic It should say in dji store. If you have or not. Something like this"
Anyone know of shorter lipo straps than the shortest rdq one?,"You can try to renew it. But show me pic of your drone warranty date ummagawd has absolutely miniscule ones. and it's annoying another annoying thing is the length is inconsistent. some are measured unfolded, some are measured folded, and you can't really tell cant you just cut it down no, I'd need to cut beyond the hook part why do you want it so short so it can actually fit around my battery"
you cant wrap it around the bottom of the quad?,If you know someone with a sewing machine they could fix that in 30 minutes
"wow yes. thanks :). Ive also heard of a power distribution board, is that also part of the stack?",no. That’s an old thing from back when we used individual escs instead of 4 escs on one circuit board ooooh. that makes so much sense now That or a fixed wing thing to power lots of big servos
:face_with_hand_over_mouth:. but thats pretty much it though right?,Camera and vtx. Frame. Props
"Does a 3.4 g weight increase on a 69.95 g whoop (4.8%) have a significant impact? The default batteries are 450 mAh, and I'd change them to 550 mAh. All things being the same except for the extra weight.. My first guess is that 3.4 g seems negligible and that I'll increase the flight time significantly.","It's not just weight you're also getting more power tho, if it was just dead weight that would change a lot. See what kind of flight time you get and determine if it's a worthwhile tradeoff for your style Oh wow didn't see this. I'll definitely buy them both now because I'm planning to fly the 85mm whoop inside too That extra 100mah can help a lot"
"Good morning everyone, the next time I dropped my drone, and now when I turn it on, the camera stabilizer doesn't work, what could have happened??  Could it be that if I change the communication cable it will resolve the issue? Or how can I find out the problem?","looks like poorly tuned pids with the way its wobbling. but check it for mechanical issues first, such as a wire rubbing on the fc or if anything is slightly loose as both of those things can mess with the gyro data and cause weird stuff"
"Hey guys, afaik there was a command to see BF OSD in G2 with Vista. Can anyone tell me which one it was?. Nevermind. I remembered it","it is some decent batteries indeed So there is a ""power"" difference. ah okay. nvm then there is a difference in energy/capacity, not power, power is basically how much it can output (well there is a slight one, but that's not really why you would get a 550mah vs a 450mah)"
does it impact the drones performance or anything in general except rssi?. well i can't find anything online so idk what that is,"Only RSSI. Yeah :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: this is the only thing. its the thingimajig top right Yeah top right it the missing part. I think it's an diode/capasitor/resistor of some sort ngl ask support maybe they'll help you further The esc pads all share a ground so they do beep for continuity. As long as the wires are NOT bridged it should be fine. aight. theres another problem also clean up that soldering oui oui. im on it, but first i gotta fix some problems with the board. one second il send the pic. im feeding 19.5v and theres a downpitch on startup. instead of          beep beep  its beep       beep I found it. It IS the antenna... xD"
what software(s) do i need to set up my tinywhoop. just betaflight?,"Betaflight Configurator and https://esc-configurator.com/. maybe ELRS Configurator as well, but likely not fully necessary i need to double check what elrs version im on for my boxer. because i tried updating it and it kept failing"
do the radio and receiver need the same version for it to even bind/work correctly?. i kinda assumed it would work cross-version,"im on 3.3, should i upload to 3.5 or is that risky because its a pre-release"
"With ELRS, major versions are compatible with each other.  eg. 3.0.1 works with 3.4.0 and 3.2.4, but not 2.1.2.  That make sense?","Oh well, then just replace the receiver, they're not that expensive anyway"
Recreationally or Professionally/commercially?,"Commercially, rec is unnecessary You'll need your Trust test: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates And you'll have to register your drone through the drone zone: https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone If you're flying commercially you'll have to do your Part 107 certification: https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot Yeah but as far as 107, it looks like the initial payment and test doesn’t need a redo as of “April” unstated year. Not trying to slam down money where I do have to #drone-laws is a good channel for this"
Do you know an good frsky drone reciever?,"!frsky. they all suck. frsky sucks Get ELRS pls. ExpressLRS has so much better range and features it's not a question. get elrs. frsky is just that bad (holds true for flysky spek futaba etc). (they all suck). (even ghost tracer and crossfire aren't worth getting, at all). (only elrs). (elrs is the only thing you should buy) Yeah, even DJI RC :skull:"
So Radiomaster is the way to go?,"should have been more persuasive. fuck that Pretty much, Radiomaster is not the only one making ELRS hardware, but they are the top in my opinion. Just avoid BetaFPV ELRS hardware pls radiomaster makes about the best radios with jumper I bought it for planes and never had issues xD Their whoops are great, just not ELRS hardware their receivers are fine Didn't know that I went to fly fpv drones xD their radios are a burning pile of shit. but the rx like say the superD or nano receiver are fairly good I would suggest getting a Radiomaster RP1 receiver. And a Radiomaster Boxer Crush or a Radiomaster Ranger module for your current radio ""*I never had issues*""=/=""*it's good*"" I assume line-of-sight only flying quads is 99% not line of sight flying. frsky cannot survive going throught a wall without having a stroke. elrs can go behind several houses and still have telemetry I lose video (O3) well before I lose ELRS lol. Even on 50mW. I have never failsafed ELRS on my quad I did..... After I flew behind a mountain Before ELRS I was flying FlySky bruh, on my arducopter, that failsafed so easily I did, it  was a bit involved, I put an x2-air on my quad and on my goggles and just went behind as many trees as possible (yes I had to walk to go pick it up) and I did failsafe it, I was at 500mw 250hz iirc. video was still fine btw, had 1.6w of analog to spare. but you would loose video before loosing elrs signal in any reasonable setup I still recommend you sell your QX7 and purchase anything from RadioMaster or Jumper (like a RM Boxer), it'll be more comfortable and perform better and you can always attach a module to the back to run FrSky ACCST. ELRS receivers are also quite cheap, same price as FrSky or cheaper. and he bought he qx7 too"
RadioMaster TX16S MKII Max. Would this a good for and drones and flying big RC planes?,"get a boxer, really. the tx16s has the ergonomics of a brick. and is just overpriced for what it is Yes! That's a good radio, but it's overpriced and no AG01 except if you really need that screen and extra switches On Boxer crush you get AG01 the boxer does too tbf. and the MAX does have AG01s I think if you need the screen, get a t15 no, the boxer is amazing, it's actually really comfy if the TX16S is boxy then the Boxer is too On their website there is a version with AG01 and without AG01 on the ""Max"" product listing"
can we stop assuming shit and just fucking ask them what they need?,"Hmm, not sure about this. My friend has TX16S, I have Boxer crush, the Boxer is more ergonomic for me."
How many switches do you end up using max? Do you feel like your QX7 has enough?,I didn't talk about the shape but about the ergonomics
"Shall I just make a list with what I want, need and or not like?","which is two somewhat different things Stop being harsh lol :slightly_smiling_face:. Sure! tbf it's kinda distracting when multiple people descend to answer a deeper question First, my usecase: - Flying RC planes. From foamies to big 1.7 meter balsa planes (electro only) - Flying 5 inch FPV race/freestyle drones  What i use from my QX7: - Voice commands/alerts - Around 6 channels for flying RC planes: Flaps, rudder, throthle, ailerons, elevator, retracts - Mixes, setting up curves/changing them ''on the fly"", pun intended - Multiple model - Simulator support - probs some more i forgot xD  What i really want in my next remote: - Screen - Hall effect joysticks (the QX7 aint having those - All the stuff i use on my QX7  - Lipo power solution for the TX - Good line of sight signal - Good not line of sight signal for flying drones  What am i expected to need in my next remote: - Heli support (so setting up the swach plate - Good enuf ergonomics  What i would like (tho that aint really an requirement but more an gimmic feel) - USB C interface - An 'premium' feel without spending to mutch - Long lasting. Like an remote i can really use for years as my primary plane and drone remote - Touchscreen (again, this is more like an gimmick and would be nice, tho buttons are fine to!) - Cheap recievers (for drone and planes, min channels for the planes would be 8)  What i don't care about: - RGB sh*t  Price range: between 150 and 300 euro's  I tried to be as clear as possible! it's good that you mentioned heli's. that's a bigger factor than you think lol"
don't all edgetx radios have the same amount of heli support?,yes but *I think* they require a lot of switches. at least when you get more into it also bigger planes tend to eat switches Yeah tried to be as specific as possible.
another question: is backpackability a concern?,"Nope, in this case carry size doesn't matter. sounds like you want a tx16s probably Yes, I think TX16S would be a good choice, I recommend going with the AG01 version that might blow out their budget"
RadioMaster TX16S MKII - Hall V4.0 Like this one?,"it just about doesn't Get the AG01 instead of Hall V4.0. AG01 are Hall effect, just more premium also make sure to pick the elrs version"
Yeah. How good is Radiomaster with flying not line of sight?,"radiomaster is just the radio manufacturer, the right question is how good is elrs at flying out of los. and it works beautifully, you won't have video for a *while* before you loose elrs connection fun fact: transmitters for FrSky not made by FrSky are generally better granted, the tx16s only does 250mw instead of the boxer and T15's 1w, but that's irrelevant if you're not trying to fly 10+ km they really need to revise the tx16s yeah, if the rx is decent, 250mw is good enough"
what would the TX16S Mk3 have?,"1w hopefully. but I would prefer they do a boxer (crush) mk2 instead, where they just add switches and give us an oled screen hold on let me pull out my ""boxer ultra"" diagram But thanks y'all for this clearification! I got an clear line to what im going to buy! :red_heart: the main problems with the TX16S are currently the incredibly flimsy and awful antenna, the stand, how close the switches are to each other and the grips. the screen could be updated to a more modern one too. dream yeah, just put the sliders on the side like the tx16s and add two switches instead of the top sliders and I would be happy I think it exceeds the physical MCU pin count, I hear well then I would remove the two top sliders and just put 2 additional switches the 6-buttons take up 12 pins put in a better MCU then I want momentary bumper switches does anyone actually use them the MCU in these things is already the size of an entire 20mm FC time to move to BGA then also, compatibility with 2-6s packs with a bottom balance plug would be so convinient top screen PLEASE so I can see my widgets I'd love being able to just swap the battery in my boxer with one of the 4s 21700 packs I bring with me when the 2s inside dies"
What ELRS drone reciever and plane reciever would you guys recommend?,"drone reciever, happymodel ep1 or radiomaster RP1. plane reciever, Radiomaster ER6 or ER8 anything you want honestly or RP1 with a speedybee wing F405"
"There are ones with onboard antennas, ones with wire antennas. Are their mutch difference inbetween those?","onboard are for smol quads like tiny whoops. lower range but no big antenna those onboard antennas only work because it's ELRS lol. they are... terrible I flew my whoop with no antenna once. crash sheared the RF filter off, so my antenna was the 2mm solder trace left on the board. ELRS didn't care. anyway, back to radio musing: Radiomaster TX20S   with both ELRS and QMRS (Quick Medium-Range System) support. more channels and telemetry, a bit less range god I love those radios, frsky makes one with *3d gimbals* (there's a twisty thingy at the end of the stick), and I want it, I have no idea what I would use it for, but it looks cool. it's on their chonky tandem radios with arm rests iirc"
I see Frsky there tho? XD,"yes, I'm saying radiomaster should make one I want radiomaster to make it, then slap inside two hot glued 1w elrs tx together have 1w of gemeni how tight should props be tightened There's a reason they sell hollow shaft AG01s. I know. it's specifically for those For sticking a twisty effort on the end of em instead of grippy ends. I know. but I also want the sexy radio, not just the twisty bit Mostly for camera work as I understand it. for anything that needs it, but it's often use in cinematography or for events or for piloting cinelifters that also have control over the camera, or for industrial work etc, plenty of possibilities Oh yeah, I use my extra analog shoulder buttons on my TX16 as a Prearm setup, but in the same way, they could be anything you want. rather obviously, yes"
"Is 1,2kg  takeoff weight normal for a 7 inch quad with gopro?","that doesn't sound overly high a ok, thx for the answer. I build a 7 inch rekon 7 build and just added a gopro and was wondering if it was getting too heavy :slightly_smiling_face:"
"I cant set VTX output power in the osd menu but it works in betaflight so SA is working, whats the problem then?","I'm so buying the betafpv air 4 in 1.  The elrs lite rx, I'm sure I have cams at home. Then a fractal 75 frame.   I'm thinking some 32,000kv 0702's. Also the current VTX temperature doesnt show in the osd (rush tank solo) but idk if my vtx even has a temp sensor That's gonna be like 3 or 4 different stores :Harold:"
"Hi everyone, a quick question about the AIR 3. Is there an option to turn on watermarks like, ""Shot on Air 3"" or something?","I've never used a camera drone.  Google says 0702 32,000kv + 40mm props is a bad idea 0702 motors are tiny and underpowered, they don't have sufficient torque to control a 40mm prop, and if they are 32,000kv too, they will cook themselves and the esc trying I'm learning more towards the air 75 whoop and just putting on those motors. You want 0802-1002 for a 75mm On 65mm it will work great. The kv is fairly high for my liking, but if you like high kv it will be great That's fine with me!  I was just thinking that's a lot of speed Yeah, I fly 23,000kv on 65mm (I should probably get some 26,000kv motors) I've never used higher than 27,000kv on a whoop.  It's more of a ""I wanna try this"" thing.. I have 27,000kv 0702 on my mobula 6. When it worked it whipped the Llamas ass Yeah, 0702 works really well with a light 31mm prop (if you don't have the hq ultralight 31mmx3, the 0.16g version, buy a dozen bags of them)"
"Yes, select the RC link preset that matches your packet rate in ELRS. And make sure you have ADC filter disabled on your radio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNIqGmgaP4","thank youuu!!. thats probably the most efficient answer ive gotten + a video to explain, thats perfection:pinched_fingers:  appreciate it"
"Il check those soon, where should it be ish?",Probably the main page
would this kind of motor setup cause instability? it would be convenient for a folding y4 if not,"I'm assuming front to back. should be ok I think no I mean both front are pusher and both back are puller or the opposite its not a side view, its a front view potentially more compact folding mech. since the props wouldn't run into each other. the other options are to use folding props or slightly offset the motors vertically I'd say both front motors and both back motors should be the same"
A Y4?!?!?. Wtf. Would that even work?. In theory I think it would,"yeah, it's been around for a while. for exemple <https://cncdrones.com/stingray-y4.html>"
what VTX are you using?,I plan to buy a T-Motor FT800
probably 90deg. is it thin or thicker coax?. ehhhhh. I'd rather just get an MMCX-SMA pigtail and SMA antennas,"But then I'd need additional 3D printing :( this wouldn't go properly in the included 3d mount either. it might, but the bend radious is a lot bigger on these thicker cables"
Isn't this TPU part made for MMCX -> SMA?,"that's made for solid stem antennas. like this Maybe I can get this thing and a longer SMA antenna like that. The last is 15cm long no you need an MMCX-SMA adapter with a wire. and a much shorter SMA antenna I got you, but it useless if I can't mount it you need to find something like this I found ""TrueRC BLAZE 110mm"" do y copter frames have to have symmetrical spacing between the arms or can it be asymmetrical"
"i currently have a mobula 8, what should i upgrade to next?. preferably prebuilt but i don’t mind diy if it has no soldering","well what's your budget, what do you wanna do and how much outside space do you have well now that i think about it mobula 8 isn’t that bad for outdoors so maybe i’ll get a indoor one but for now it’s 200, stunts, and i’d say i have a good amount but i would say i have enough for something for more than a 2.5"
maybe frame swap the mob8 to ductless and get a 65mm or 75mm?,i don’t have the guts to fly ductless. any suggestions for a 65 or 75 air75. yeah u do. i believe in u
:loudly_crying_face:. is that a beta?,i got 2s batteries only doe well now u get 1s ones too
lol. any suggestions for goggles?. i’ve been using this cloned one for a while,"goggles are pricey. like cobra x are cheapest it gets for ""good"""
"i’ll stick to my clone :loudly_crying_face:. if u don’t mind me asking, what got u into this hobby?","like... back in 2016-2017 i got obsessed with FPV wings and planes People 1/4 mile away said they were hearing my DJI drone and then a few years later I bought my first stuff which was a really shitty tinywhoop fly it up high fr. lol tinyhawk and qx7 :loudly_crying_face: I don't break laws sir, I stay under 120m. the only good product they make are their 3.5"" props. that's literally it qx7 is downright terrible in comparison with radiomaster and jumper stuff good citizen. oh i didn’t know that i was planning to get a boxer than switched to a tx12 for some reason Mine worked fine for me. My TX16S has much nicer feeling gimbals though wings seem so fragile and so easy to break. i was going to get that but i didn’t know what i was going to use all those switches for I have a radiomaster pocket and it has too many switches on it. I will never use them. I don't even switch from acro anymore w. i remember when i was younger i tried to build a rc car cause i liked remotely controlled things so bad frankly even the tx16s isn't that nice what would u consider a really good controller that doesn’t have a bunch of switches n stuff that quads wouldn’t need my personal picks would be the T20 first, and then I would like a combination of the T15 and Boxer. one like @Sea_Kerman made I want a top screen so I can see my widgets while flying my planes Little scripts on an edgetx color radio. Telemetry readouts like battery and link quality mostly."
u don’t want a screen?. oh ic,well you sound like you're only doing quadcopters and stuff. so all you need is the little screen the T20 has
the t20 has a screen?. uhh. oh the tiny on on the top. i didn’t know it had that,i thought it didn’t even have one. planes need too much space i mean fair but. storage unit to fly as well. cant really just take it out for 10 minutes I meannn. there are ones where you can https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6622923 The tiny ones are actually really cool no printer though. maybe i’ll get a printer instead of a upgrade Bambulabs a1 mini is what I have and I really like it. It's small for printing actual models but it's also only 200
i don’t think i would be printing anything big. anything i should know if i were to get a printer?,"Don't breathe the fumes Why does it look like it crashed would i need to buy anything else for it besides filaments. do you wear goggles to fly it (never looked at wings before) No, that one is line of sight The guys in #3d-printing told me to get the sovol printer if I had to get one. That's all I really know about 3d printers Fpv planes are harder because you either need a friend to throw it or a big runway and landing gear or a launcher. Can’t really easily toss it then put the goggles on I know almost nothing besides all the design stuff when I got mine Toss it get it up in the air then goggles on. If it's small you can probably toss with goggles The new inav gps-less pos hold might be helpful I want to make a joke but there are kids here i would lose track of it in the sky and lose it Not really. And this is a somewhat more advanced one, sleek and higher wing loading. Trainers like the FT Scout, FT Tutor, etc. fly slower"
am i able to just plug in a radiomaster pocket controller and practice on a simm without the batteries? controller is arriving a little earlier than expected,DJI neno. or neo. Idk didn't specify which drones Amu that is 250g drone so I thought DJI Neo or Mavic Mini 4 would be the best There is a way actually  https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1263135984883732541 awesome! I just happened to pick up a powered 2.0 hub at the club fair today
"I know there’s a hdzero AIO coming soon, but is there any news of anything similar from walksnail?","Shame, would simplify builds so much"
Can I bind 2 transmitters to 1 Rx ? (elrs),There is no way I'd use one though.. **Fuck That**. AIOs are twitchy enough without stacking a Walksnail VTx on it an' all. honestly with how much just... stuff and RF shenanigans goes on those tiny Walksnail boards I don't even know if It's feasible to put it on a small aio. definitely not right now It'd be a fuckin' space heater.
Is it ok for the battery leads to be under tension like this?,"so long as it doesn't end up in the props it's fine, just not ideal, try to rotate the battery 180 degree and see if the battery lead is long enough Over time they will degrade and probably wire will deteriorate but you know is ok it has the same frame motors and props as the tinyhawk freestyle 3, so it is almost definitely it Tinyhawk II freestyle"
Really? but then how this is 450mah but half the size,"also, the strap is supposed to go under the top plate, not around the whole quad Aaaa right right. You know i would do the xt60, but then i would have to buy new battery"
So what remote control you use?,That does make more sense. Thanks for the heads up. Jumper T-Lite its so worth it. the battery sag is way less i have a TH3 freestyle. i replaced it with xt30. its flies a lot better
interesting. you are using also the frsky d8 or you upgrade the drone?,D8. I've considered looking into an upgrade thoughh and you could still use the 1s batteries by changing the battery connectors on them to bt2 or sth you know. im not sure if its more economical to upgrade my tinyhawk to some elrs stuff and buy a radiomaster. or just upgrade it then buy an adapter for my qx7
"hello i just got my dji goggles 3, i was hopeing to connect to the pc and play sims with it, problem is Idk how to ""activate"" them or even how to make the pc sceen into the goggles. any video tutorial? i did not find anythinmg",idk if thats possible
can i fix that by setting the motor timing higher?,"Hey guys, so ive been having an issue with my quad that could honestly stem from a lot of things but i was wondering if anyone has had a case like this before and can give me some insight, so sometimes when i fly, at seemingly random times, sometimes during loops and stuff the drone just shuts off and falls out of the sky, it doesnt dissarm cause i have the dissarm thing on the osd, after a while when i go to get it, without unplugging or replugging the battery it plays the power up sound again, but the goggles have video the entire time, i have a dvr recording of it and nothing seemed to be out of order, the rssi dbm were finde the LQ was fine, but it just.. happens.. somtimes after 1 pack sometimes after 3 packs idkk why (i have a tinyhawk 3 freestyle HD and a radiomaster boxer crush, i have the UAV Tech 2-4'' preset in BF applied and the 500hz elrs preset, i have the radio on 500hz in the lua script so that should be fine)  except for that it flies like a charm tbh. its not really that big of an issue, nothing has broken yet in a crash partially cause the tinyhawk is so light and sturdy, but its just annoying, so id appreciate some help if anyone has heard of stuff like this. im thinking it could be the RX, the ESC or the battery or sth like that. i also dont think that it failsafes cause id get a warning in the osd. looks like this: looks like a :sparkles: desync :sparkles: Not a single future quad will be using FrSky on a BNF and the QX7 can't really do ELRS full speed, there's no reason to want to not upgrade well no it doesn't have to be your ESC, it could be tuning related but I don't know anything about this stuff its already on mediuhigh"
You're on Bluejay right?,hate when people not just give the full screenie lol
Didn't you change that with someone else a week or so ago?,"idk if it _could_ be the capacitor, its only on the battery lead not directly on the ESC, but i just cant put it on the ESC cause there is not way i can fit it. nope. i dont think so probably just want to ping someone who knows a lot about this. no blackbox makes it hard yeahh i ordered a blackbox module thing tho :) but yeah, you can try increasing the motor idle and demag compensation ohh yeah i just watched a JB video on demag compensation. thats probably it tbh. but i set the motor timing to high aswell. ill test it tomorrow"

Does it matter what side of the fc I solder my motors? Using the f4 1s aio from betafpv. 5a one,you can try it. idea is to get that second cell to an acceptable voltage without the charger screaming at you that its too low
"My fc has a 5v pad and my vtx wants 3.1v-13v, I assume I can use the 5v pad no problem?. Or is soldering to battery positive a better idea","Both will work fine, if you experience blackout after a crash (usually happens because the motors stopped spinning abruptly and the voltage dropped below 3.1v and the vtx doesn't start to send power again, hdzero does it, idk for walksnail) then using vcc (batt pads) will be better Im just gonna solder to batt pad. For some reason the 5v pad is the only pad on the board that doesn’t want to cooperate"
"I mean, (dumb guess but sometimes people forget about it and complain about their stuff not working) you did solder on the gnd connection as well ?",Yes. There’s a ground pad on the fc. Black to gnd :slightly_smiling_face:
"I tried looking for firmware updates or something, but I can't seem to find anything in the eachine website. Any idea on what I could do? They have been sitting idle for a while, but I don't think that should be an issue","If your solder joints look like that then that having been the issue can't be outruled. some of those are almost touching Hi! I'm having some issues with my analog goggles (eachine ev300o) which for some reason are getting very poor signal reception. At first I thougt it was my kwad, but I used my very old box googles and I got better sigal ill start with redoing them ig. they are really shitty These are better and it’s still not working. Moved red to battery lead cuz I read online the fc could be being weird about the voltage regulator. Pic is kinda bad but there’s no spikes or things that look like they could bridge. it looks like im missing a resistor. heat wouldnt have been anywhere near it so it either fell off or arrived this way. unfortunate. i have to rma it. Capacitor actually. welp whoop flies great just cant use fpv. los flying time. or i could just be a moron and build 3.5 and then come back to this thing when i get vtx back from walksnail. idk"
Does the normal mode with the avata series do the same stuff that the mini series does?,"can anyone recomend a mini whoop that works with dji. so far i have found Alpha A85 4S HD none do, the DJI video transmitters are just too big and heavy. smallest you'll find are 2"" cinewhoops thats fine im new to fpv so i dont know to much i have a mark 5 right now and i enjoy it but i just wanted to get a tinny guy so i can practice tricks and those cinewhoops will fly terribly because too heavy"
you have a suggestion for something i could do ?,"well.. no. there are no good mini whoops that run dji, which is correct. but saying a 2"" cinewhoop wil lfly badly bc dji is.. wrong imo"
is there a ok mini woop that ill work with this ?,"that's pretty much the worst possible gear for a tinywhoop this what i just got. But your saying i need new gear for a mini woop that isn't v mini. we're saying whoever told you to get that was a dumb dumb idiot head. bc that battery is way too big for that quad its fun to fly with it XD that was my dumb decision lol but it fly longer :smiling_face_with_tear: Tyranny of the rocket equation it weighs too much so the quad has to work harder to stay up Fly longer requires more battery, makes more mass so needs more power so battery lasts less, resulting in very little flight time gain"
can someone help me with gyroflow?,https://dontasktoask.com/ I cant use gpu encoding to export my footage
What GPU have you got?,"Ive never used it, but what options do you have under the h264/avc dropdown Hm, would've expected nvidia to be the most compatible one... odd."
Would you happen to have some sort of integrated graphics enabled as well?,what are y’all’s personal favorite controllers
"And are you running GPU drivers from nvidia's website, or the stuff you get from Windows? @FpvByAlex. RM Pocket :3. *and all of the recent RM Crush radios*",what. oh. wait nvm ik it
"hm.... dang, the info is easily available in W11, not W10... Do you know how to open Device Manager?. If yes, open it and see what you have in Display Adaptors @FpvByAlex",okay so no iGPUs. weeeird. I'd try installing latest nvidia drivers ight. @The GGManiack. reinstalled and restarted shh  :loudly_crying_face:. muscle memory https://wetransfer.com if u have a clip on hand u can share <2GB upload it there. RAW footage for gyroflow. i forgot a space between `/` and `if`
any change in gyroflow?,"Yo gentlemen, new here. Curious about some ideas of what to charge for accident mapping and measurements for an insurance firm. If anyone does this. Sorry if it’s the wrong place to ask"
Is it necessary for to fly?. Will it fly without it?,It can fly without it Ok. Why would I get one then
Idk. Why would I ask if I knew. Does it give the drone more storage?,The drone has no storage. So you have to put an SD card in it so you can store your pictures and videos
"Are you trying not to buy a $10 SD card for a $300 drone?. If that's the case, you can go ahead. It's not going to be the same quality without an SD card","you dont get full resolution iirc, or it may not let you take pictures. i dont remember You can take a few pictures and videos of lower quality Ok hat the into info I was looking for. Thanks"
wdym?. no port for it?. or it doesnt work,"I am having a problem with the mobula 7. Every time I move my sticks it takes off really quick. I can not control the drone. What can I do to make enjoyable to fly Practice more and get better You could also try throttle limit/expo as well as lower rates if you really struggle, but just flying more in the simulator would be better @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)I give my drone 20% throttle and my drone takes off and slams on my ceiling Then just get better at throttle management. That's just a skill issue. If you think it actually flies uncontrollably and it shoots up with almost no throttle, then you can send a video of it where we can see both the quad and your sticks @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)is there something i can adjust that it will make it easier for me Using a simulator and practice the balance plug (white) my charger doesn't let me the charger doesn't charge stuff unless there is a xt30 or xt60 connected I wonder how you could possibly pass from a barrel plug to an xt60 knowing both are just DC plugs Or even connect an xt60 to the positive and negative leads of the balance plug… Need a DC barrel plug to XT60 adapter, that's the best option. Honestly I think it should have come with an XT60 on it like the one RDQ sells, and it's dumb af that it doesn't."
do you think this will be causing the warm motors? I was thinking that they may be over-propped but i wasn't sure,"yeah, I got it used so that's probably why I didn't have one You need to make sure the FC isn't being slapped around by any loose cabling, make sure nothing that's soldered to the FC is then cable tied immediately to the frame (it'll conduct vibration into the FC), things of that nature.. Tiny Quads like this are a royal pain in the arse for vibration issues.. Have a look for an ""official"" cinewhoop preset (after backing up the current config).. I'm still in the middle of sorting the tune out on mine, but it's flyable by using that Cinewhoop tune and turning the master multiplier down a couple of notches. Yes i've seen a couple people say turning down the master multiplier down helps.. I'll have a good look over my drone and make sure that vibration isnt the issue then ill have a look at presets Specifically, after applying that preset. The default got trilling noises out of my motors.. Any cabling to the FC should have a few mm of slack to ensure the gummies aren't being bypassed by rigid cabling. ah ok ill check all my cablings good too Anything loose on the frame will be a huge problem for such a small machine.. (it's taken me months to get mine flying right. 3.5"" freestyle machines are waaay easier to work with. Yes. Mistuned machines can melt motors if they're bad enough. ah i see. i know that excess D gain can cause overheating motors I highly recommend Chris Rosser's ""Betaflight tuning masterclass"" videos. alright i'll check them out All highly relevant to what you're doing also my esc is blheli s"
should flash to blujay??,"Might wan... Yeah, that or will i be better off just getting it up and running smoothly Bidirectional DSHOT is a game changer. ye i may give that a try too then Massive help to you here that.. RPM filtering needs it to work IIRC."
this allows for RPM filtering right??,"Step one, flash the ESCs That might even be in those vids too actually. I'm off to bed. Good Luck :yellow_heart: alright. again thank you so much for your help :slightly_smiling_face:  would have made this a lot harder to try to fix No worries, let me know how you get on. Drop me a ping so I can find it easy. :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Very random question, but is there a reason why digital vtx's require both rx and tx uart wires? I would've thought the data flow is just FC > VTX","2 questions. 1 what is ur personal favorite controller. and 2, what do y’all bring if you’re trying to be as compact as possible during a trip radiomaster pocket to both Digital VTXs communicate both ways to negotiate and set OSD over the MSP + Displayport protocol like the entire setup not just controller some newer analog VTXs (OpenVTX) also support this, which allows you to not need to set up a VTX table"
how big is the whoop?,"If im gonna be flying outdoor its: - Radiomaster Pocket - Mob8 walksnail - Avatar goggles L - Toothstor charger - few batteries 1. Probably a FlySky Nirvana or Jumper T20 2. I wouldn't bring anything but necessities so a small transmitter (T20 or Pocket), compact goggles (Cobra X and binoculars) and from there on it depends on the drone but generally a small charger (ViFly or ToolkitRC) and as many batteries as I can carry. If I know I'm going to be gone for long I'll take a simple tiny soldering kit with a TS100 or Pinecil and spare parts. once again coming clutch to answer my questions :thumbs_up: and if you do expect to make configuration changes, an Android phone with OTG support or some form of laptop is useful too. I think it requires that yeah, here's a small quote from how it works for analog ones. > MSP Control - MSP is the most common and vender neutral communication protocol. Like SmartAudio and TRAMP it can be used to set the VTx frequency, power, and pitmode. It has the added benefit of being able to self configure the VTx Table used in Betaflight. When the VTx powers up it will query the flight controller and check for a VTx Table. If it does not exist, or is incorrect, then OpenVTx will send the correct VTx Table to the flight controller. this isnt my pic but it looks kinda similar to this when packed @enoki i  don’t have a android During trips I usually just get a bag for only my fpv stuff and bring basically my whole bench just to be sure If need a fifth battery strap, I have it (idk if it helps you) some form of laptop then, or last ditch effort you can get a bluetooth adapter with the speedybee app i normally unscrew the sticks from the pocket though didn’t recognize it without the orange 3d printed thing. alright thanks walksnail one doesnt have the red thing its got a different canopy/mount The walksnail version doesn't use the 3d printed bumper from the factory"
do you bring a battery bank?. ohh ic. what’s the 3000 used for?,"For my whoops I use a 5000mah 4s pack to field charge, and I just don't field charge my 5"" packs, I just bring 8 of them and it's usually dark before I have the time to fly every single one of my batteries anyway ic. oh i thought they would’ve had a built in battery most higher end goggles dont at first i hated it but ive come to love it, gives you alot more freedom you can use any 2s-6s battery to power them And the goggles weigh less"
do they run out of battery quick or something? i’ve never came close to running out but then again i have a weird clone. is it just like better weight distribution,Lighter and better weight distribution yeah yeh having the weight on the bench or in your pocket is nicer than on your head or you can even strap the battery  to the back of the headband if you want and use it as a counterweight. but having a lipo next to your head is a bit scary my goggles feel mad light and it’s built in but they’re pretty shitty it’s a clone. i don’t have a clue
does anyone here have a very low material (think betafpv air canopy) stl that i could print in tpu for my air75?,"i’ve heard that the t20 had a lot of issues, have u experienced any I don't own one but I know all the issues it *potentially* has are easy to fix"
ic. also why doesn’t anyone use dji goggles? is it cause it’s digital. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) do you think a tx12 could fit inside a compact carrying bag?,"if you're thinking of buying a tx12 i recommend against it. but probably yeah, it's around the same size as the boxer and zorro DJI is useless on anything that's smaller than like... a 3"""
that’s y i’m asking. why?,"and plenty people use DJI, but more often than not now only commerically"
"quick question, if im in the same room as my router (~6ft from it), would it be normal for ELRS to be extremely inconsistent? like disconnects from the drone every few sec","they only have huge VTXs Walksnail got them good with all the small stuff and the options. no, do the bench test what goggles should i be using overall goggles L are a cheap way into walksnail"
x arent really budget are they?,definitely. all of them
alright. what’s the main difference between the mob 8 analog and the walksnail one?. v. and last question fr. what bag do y’all suggest to hold a tiny whoop goggles controller and other essentials,one uses the analog system one uses walksnail :p. there's not really FPV specific bags. just anything with compartments yeah but like. do you suggest any tbs gearpouch is nice and compact
an entire back pack or just a pouch?,probably pouch. you could say a backpack and i’ll check it out though @RadioMistress might have some suggestions I use a leather bag now
would it fit a whoop?. what’d u used to use?,"Lol I got it all. What didn't I use. Like grocerystore bags tbh. Actually there was definitely some lipos in grocery bags. The pelican cases are nice. Why video discord This is what I use. Lol. I have pelican cases to. Peak design makes nice gear It's stealthy. I have some torvol bags to. And pgytech i’m just looking for a pouch i think. cause everytime i want to fly i have to take everything out of different places cause i have no spot  to store it all. makes going out to fly a hassle Better off with a tote :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: peak design camera cube could potentially be really good for whoops tbh Gotta have the ready to fly tote customizable compartments, make one big for the transmitter and use the others for the whoops/other stuff Which is 1 drone setup ready to go. I've never used a bag, there's so much stuff The bag might go in the tote to Your not gonna want it all in the bag peak design backpacks are also excellent but theyre pretty damn expensive Especially tools and stuff. That's annoying to drag around but you might need to fly. I use large totes from Costco You jsut throw everything needed in it and when you finally get time to fly it's ready to go. Just add charged batteries i use a peak design tech pouch for all of my tools, it can fit literally every tool i need for fpv besides my multimeter i looked at the tbs gear pouch but it wouldn’t fit a whoo best part about peak design too is that its made for fragile camera gear so if you drop the bag everything inside should be fine i am wera fangirl. wiha silly i have the linus tech tips screwdriver, thing was wayyy to expensive but its really good I don't like TBS stuff as a whole never had any of their products that wasn't awful so it's hard to trust. It's a dying company it’s a cheap pouch so i wouldn’t be loosing alot that's the wrong mindset thoughh. because you're losing something instead of nothing true. i just need something that could fit that. the box goggles are pretty garbage so i’ll probably get a upgrade soon yeah but finding something to store it in is more difficult then i thought it’d be if you want something durable as fuck, you could look into getting a cubed foam insert ""pick n pluck"" for a nanuk heavy duty case. nanuks are awesome no need for that lol. i wouldn’t be dropping it or anything i might consider a nanuk for *just* the 10"" when i build it i think ur underestimating how big a 10"" is i dont actually know the wheelbase of this frame i was gonna get. its not listed anywhere, ill see if rosser can send me the info in a lil bit. but like the wheelbase of something like the rekon10 (deadcat, ik) would fit nicely in a nanuk 940 (props off). why is foam so expensive. 75$ for cube foam for the nanuk 940 i bought the hota d6 acdc in recomendation to people that have helped me, but it is in chinese, i dont know chainese xD Where’d you get it from"
urgetn question. can i put conformal coating. on a backup beeper?,yes but don't like cover the buzzer itself. cover around the bottom of it that is touching the pcb
will conformal coating stick to heat shrink tube?. i should have done this earlier. its midnight and the filming is tomorrow. its river water. should be fine. idg if this 422C will dry fast enough. can i UV cure KotKing?,has anyone here tried the spray as opposed to the typical brush applicator you can find on amazon https://mgchemicals.com/products/conformal-coatings/conformal-coating-spray/circuit-board-waterproofing/ you can UV cure 422C. i think. you need to be precise so a spray is useless. worst that happens is dead beeper that makes sense. 422c technical sheet doesnt say anything about uv curing. you can speed up with heat tho  https://i.imgur.com/mSjjha6.png i will heat up my print bed and begin the process with its UV black light i dunno if the buzzer can handle that heat. probably can handle 65 i will do 65 degrees. to be safe
is it a vifly finder 2?,"it should probably be fine at 65. my printer has a heated chamber, im now very glad to know 422c cures quick in heat mine is not enclosed but should stll work fine enough. with UV AND heat UV doesnt affect the curing, the only thing UV does for 422c is fluoresce (so you can find spots you missed)"
should i use a dampo  cloth to remove dirt then can blow it before coating it?,isopropyl would be better but sure
ya know what doesnt help. i routed my motor wires backwards to look neat. How does that look?,"In hindsight I should have probably dipped  the second brush9 in isopropyl alcohol and then brush to that instead of the cotton pad. Got a little hairy but I think I got most of that hair off I set the 3D printer bed to 70° and set a timer for 20 minutes. I might have to wait longer because of the heat emanating from the bottom instead of the top. Wait no I'll just cover the thing in a plastic bag. I just covered my print bed and the drone in a plastic grocery bag so that should trap some of the heat. It's just on top of the drone not on top of the bed so it will be leaking up the sides but that is okay. I don't have to be at the location until 1:00 p.m. so I will. I was going to say drink alcohol but I don't think that's a good idea since they still have the rest of the quad to coat. I* I gloop it on there when I coat stuff, just make sure all the funny spots it likes to get into are plugged"
"I'm helping someone setting up his drone (remote), and his drone keeps giving these (startup)  beeps repeatedly. What can cause this?","SOS beeps.  Check in configuration, look at the beeper settings. One does beep an SOS when something or other.. Might be SOS on failsafe, so check all switch (modes) assignments and configuration."
Or a switch that is set to beep?,"obviously morse code, the drone has become sentient. doesnt sound like sos to me, the first one is five quick beeps which would be a 5, then an O and then an I. but yeah, flip all the switches to the off position I'm not yet at my PC, so I can't get screenshots. It'll be something in the ""beep when this shit happens"" list of toggles on the right of ""configuration"" in BF."
If you unlocked the DJI Integra gogggles wit the FCC hack (ham_cfg_support)  do you still need to unlock the vista on the quad?,"The module type field populates automatically when you select the radio that you have. Leave it alone I saw that but i wanted to be sure. Thank you Sticking the wrong firmware on there can brick it (it *can* be recovered, but it's a lot of effort).  'e's right. Don't fuxx with it. :yellow_heart: @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  i think the problem with my drone is not a desync issue.. it doesnt spin the motors or anything.. it just.. turns off mid flight, then when i went to pick up the drone, it played the start up sound again after like 10 seconds, but the battery didnt get disconnected or anything, and i had Video the entire time, i dont see whats wrong with this, ill attach a video of when it turned off and the entire DVR, i cant figure out what this is Everything looks fine, LQ, Rssi dbm, no stutter, the motors arent loud or juttery or anything, the drone flies like absolute butter.. until it doesnt.. i didnt disarm or anything and it also wasnt cause it wouldve showed on the osd, that was my first pack, then it didnt happen again until the 4th pack.. seem very random  idk whats going on :loudly_crying_face:  pls help yes pls help. :loudly_crying_face:. on the very last pack i didnt even do anything.. i was just hovering and it tumbled into the ground.. the temps were fine too, it was maybe like 50°C and the motors were barely warm Loose esc connection. Fc doesn't reboot so it isn't power. Check your esc harness cable for context it is an AIO on a Tinyhawk last crash DVR pretty much looks like one motor just stopped and it started spinning yes, the only mod i did was i soldered an xt30 onto it instead of the ph2.0. but the solder connections are good"
Does that thing record blackbox?,"idk if it could be the connection, all i did was cut off the ph2.0, and solder this: <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/betafpv-4s-whoop-cable-pigtail-xt30-7291.html> onto it by soldering the wires together. not really much to see but looks like this. i made sure there was no tension on the cable behind the cable tie Interesting, the vtx osd does disappear for a moment when it happens. But then it comes right back yeahh.. i was thinking maybe the Antenna or rx or sth. idek Nah an antenna issue wouldn't cause something that looks like power loss. I'll have to think on this heres a vid of my last pack, where it happened again at the end. alright, thank you for looking at it tho, i really have no clue what it is ._.. i appreciate it :). whats weird is.. it happened on the first pack.. doesnt happen on the next 2 and it happened on the last pack.. and i flew every battery to about 3.6V and i had around the same flight time on each of the packs (like 3-4 minutes). and otherwise the drone flies really well"
"I assume you mean 3.6v/cell. And not 3.6v total. Even though it's an aio, it sounds to me like, based on what you're describing, the ESC are rebooting, even if the FC itself isn't. Do you have a capacitor installed?","Hmmmmmmmmmm. :PepeBigHmm: :PepeHmm: yup, only on the pigtail tho, no space in the frame. its a 25V 220uF Yea that's fine, it doesn't help with esc noise as much but it can still help with power delivery. Got me stumped rn me too :loudly_crying_face:. ive looked it up like 3 times for an extensive amount of time. i couldnt find anything. it certainly isnt desync, its not the rx, or anything and those were issues other people were having when their drone fell out of the sky. and its also not fail-safing cause id have that on the osd. ill send a pic of my AIO in a sec. maybe thatll tell us sth. looks pretty clean to me :man_shrugging:"
Oh yeah do I need a capacitor for this?,"Yes, a 35v 470-1000uf never bad to have one You can go higher voltage if you want to, just not lower. And higher voltage will also mean a bigger capacitor @DædalusFPV this is my esc config.. i dont think anything is wrong here Check if it comes with the aio Nothing on their site says it does I went to check, it comes with a 35v 1000uf, so you don't *need* a new one, but it will probably be a pain in the ass to fit inside this fairly compact frame Where did you find that info. I couldn’t - The only thing that did not met our expectations was the capacitor. Thats why we will add a smaller one of our own choise https://shop.rubberquads.com/products/airbot-fenix-aio Oh ok. That capacitor is kinda massive Not really. It's big, but a lot of people use those on their 5"", when they can fit it that is"
on an aio board i see the AT7456E is responsible for osd stuff but what is responsible for the transmission of the frequency to the antenna ?,well does the aio board have a vtx integrated yes. i mean most boards are all the same ic's. https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/MAX7456.pdf. this chip is definetly not doing any radio stuff. this was a good article. https://brushlesswhoop.com/anatomy-of-an-all-in-one-fc/
See i cant find the ELRS boxer in stock anywhere... any way i can use elrs on the 4 in 1 or the CC2500?,where are you from. I'll find it in stock for you https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/radiomaster-boxer-transmitter-elrs. there you go. they also have the boxer crush in stock
I should have said. is it a viable solution?. or just get elrs one,imo just get the ELRS one.. I was only answering that part of your question because it wasn't answered.
"Thank you. See, i'm a bit torn, does the output power really matter that much? I have a feeling even with 1W of the boxer my video would probably cut out before i reach even near the limit for this",it's not that simple. many neighborhoods have tons of interference on 2.4. more output power will fight through that
"I see the TX12 has an ELRS option also, same as the pocket and the zorro with the 250mw output power, also lets me use D8 for my current drone. Is this an option as well? I havent seen it mentioned at all to be honest","The TX12 is pretty much outdated. worse than the other options in most ways. and none of them do ELRS and CC2500 at once. you just want the Boxer >""rubberquads.com""  >look inside >no rubber"
"what tools would i need to build a drone? a soldering iron kit, wut else","allen keys. wire cutters. wire strippers is there just a small toolkit to get all of those. or do i have to get each individually https://oscarliang.com/fpv-tools/#FPV-Toolkits thanks. which one would u personally suggest honestly what id do is get the rdq kit, a pinecil v2, mg chemicals solder 63/37 or that other brand that starts a K, dont remember, a set of sharp tweezers, a cheap silicone soldering mat from aliexpress or amazon, then a soldering stand w/ sponge & brass wire sponge. hobby knifes are really nice if you want some clean strips without buying a whole wire stripper (with whoop wires you can just use your fingernails to strip wires) is a soldering mat expensive you dont need it. i don't like them personally what would y’all consider like the necessities allen keys. wire cutters. wire strippers. a soldering kit https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807250554951.html yeah you dont but i like it for organizations sake ic. could i get allat for like 70 do i look like google to you u should get ur eyes checked"

Back to 5 for years. Then bassiscaly everything for a while. Noe mainly just micros and whoops."
Were you too good for a 5”?,what i was asking was which chip on the aio is responsible for transmitting the video.
Huh interesting. Yeah $160. Do you still fly analog?,it was like 90 bucks back then. Walksnail https://tenor.com/sdJSYajjPhN.gif
How do I clean my ESC?,"Anything above like, 90% isopropyl alcohol works fine + a cotton swab. unplug it and let it dry after, should be like 5-10 mins, isopropyl dries really fast"
I have 70% alcohol is that good enough?,"Yeah, just give it plenty of time to dry"
"yes, allow 30 min or so to dry. or use hairdryer, but on cold setting. Does anyone have a partslist for a 5inch freestyle analog? Cheapest that is worth building","a budget would be nice what is a normal sort of budget. like, you know. nothing ultra performance high ens just something for a bit of range you know, bit of this bit of that. £80 how much are you willing to spend. no youll need like 250 minimum for a bnf and prob closer to 300 for a build"
whew fuck that. how about for 3.5?,"thats not including a charger and batteries n stuff either. prooobably like 250. maybe also 300. lemme check where is the money going man. I bought that. vifly toothstor charger. i have a separate charger for other types of batteries up to like wont be enough for a 3.5'' you gonna tell me im gonna burn house down but it has been ok for many years charging all my lipos now, is a b6ac alright lets bump this up to atleast 280"
"I have: goggles radiomaster boxer charger will buy batteries  the drone will cost 280?. i dont mind to be honest will just have to set aside a little each month, but what you think?","You can get a BNF for 200 dollars. iFlight ECO. to put this into perspective a bit, the cheapest possible 30x30 stacks are 60 dollars, every motor is 15-20 dollars, cheapest frame 30 dollars, analog vtx 50 dollars, good analog camera 20 dollars, receiver 15 dollars"
"so around. 235usd. so like. £180. what vtx you recommend?. or even, any decent AIOs?","you don't use an AIO for a 5"". RUSH or TBS VTX"
So use loctite after building?,"after you've finished everything is usually when i used to do it, just screws for the externals, well once you confirmed the drone actually flies, then once you're happy, loctite it"
Makes sense :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. I could imagine myself loctiting everything and then realise I have to solder on the beeper. Doesn't loctite make repairing hell tho?,"a little, usually for airsoft i used to heat up the screws a little bit with a hot air gun, but im not sure that would end well with a drone. Could probably, apply a solder iron to the tip of the screw for like. 10 seconds. would give it enough time to soften if you quickly unscrew it use fpv stores. you're in the UK"
what do you mean catalog?,"I would prefer RUSH but TBS is good too, 800mW at the minimum"
Mipi cable is mipi cable right? So if I need one for walksnail it would be the same as for dji mipi?,"im thinking of getting the lowepro quadguard kit or case, any comments or suggestions mipi cable is mipi cable, the gospel"
So any mipi cable would work?,"I would imagine that a mipi cable for a mipi cable connection would work. probably like this They don't. there's slight differences. O3 mipi cables have different connectors at the end. normal WS uses the same connectors as the older DJI stuff, but Walksnail still requires more coax in the cable so those don't work either over time i believe those chargers begin to sense voltage incorrectly and can overcharge a battery, which is the fastest way to start a lipo fire. its not guarenteed to happen, but it is common. I had a similar charger that started doing that to me a long time ago. Could be, so far it has served me well, I check my batteries when charging every 20 mins or so with a multimeter, or that handy battery checker that plugs in. Always sort of paranoid about it i picked up a toolkitrc m series charger for like 30 bucks and hooked it up to and old laptop PSU and it works phenomenally Even if I get the best charger on the market i think I would still do that. ooo very nice its probably good practice but i dont bother lol I should have got that instead of the toothstor. oh well, guess more chargers for me then https://www.getfpv.com/toolkitrc-m6-v2-0-150w-10a-charger-cell-checker-servo-tester.html. i got the m6d so i can do two at once, but this works as well. they double as servo testers and they can read and output sbus, ppm, and pwm. plus you can power them off DC so you 12v car battery or another lipo. i also have an older m8 @cyberFluke Hi mate. I've done what you had recommended me doing the other day, flashed esc firmware and watched those videos on PIDS and i've adjusted them to what I think they should be. I tried arming it and now all it does is freak out. It arms and as soon as i touch the sticks, the motors spin up and go wild and then it totally cuts out after about a second. Im really not sure what I've done or how to fix it now. you should be, that charger is known to downright start destroying batteries and catch fire. so the crazy thing is its been doing this for like damn near a decade. how old is that charger ancient. and every clone made probably gets worse and cheaper 2006. bruh. almost twenty years it can't display any of the battery health stuff either, most of them can't If it works it works like, I will get the toolkitrc one but i'll keep the b6 in case I need to bring batteries back to life or thag im not sure what all youve already checked, but motor order, prop order, esc motor direction, and betaflight motor direction are top causes of freak outs like that. i didnt throw out my b6 clone either, but i also havent touched it in 5 years. not really any reason to"
could i need to redo motor direction after reflashing esc firmware??,"i think so but im not positive. an easy way to check all this stuff, PROPS OFF, is open betaflight motor tab with the battery in and run the motor number reordering section, then spin up each motor and verify its spinning the right direction. then make sure it actually corresponds to betaflights direction. your propeller direction, betaflight direction, and esc direction all have to match. its easy to miss one of the three. for example some people swap to flying props out motor direction and swap their esc and prop direction but forget to specify in betaflight. and if any of them spin in a way that doesnt match betaflight's diagram, change it by writing new esc settings Thank you for your help. Ive just been into betaflight and ive checked the motor direction and as you suggested some were incorrect yeah if they were correct before, the esc flashing probably overwrote them. hopefully it works now, lmk if it doesnt lol so i tried to change their direction but no matter weather i press forward or reverse they spin in the smae direction"
"what esc configurator are you using?. fun fact, by swapping (resoldering) any two motor wires on an esc you can change a motors direction. but this will almost always be easier. and are your escs blheli32 or blheli_s?","do you mean what i used to flash new firmware. sorry im relatively new to this yeah, the configurator is just the program on your computer. betaflight is the flight controller configurator. https://esc-configurator.com/ i think this is the easiest esc configurator unless you have blheli32 escs esc was on blheli_s but i flashed to blujay yeah thats the one i used"
"ok good good. so you should be pressing ""read settings"", changing your direction, then pressing ""write settings"". is that what youre doing?",yes i think thats what i did
"i dont have an esc with me right now so im kinda going from memory, but that should fix it. are you sure youre changing the settings on the right esc?. the motors should all do a beep chime thing when you hit write",yes i followed chris rosseras. oop sorry. lemme retype that :face_with_tears_of_joy: sure i followed chris rossers video and everything seemed to be as it was with his example
https://youtu.be/Ro4YMCLJ1dU?feature=shared this is the video. skip to sorta 9 mins i think. ill check that,chris is an incredibly smart guy so that should be a good video to follow ye i just connected back into esc configuartor and only 3 esc pop up
"when you press read only 3 escs show up?. thats not good lol. i would unplug everything and power off the quad, then try again",yeah just did that and alls good now
ok good. so do some of them say reversed?. or did it not save,motor direction is normal
do you know which number motors are spinning the wrong way?,umm i think so. ill check again
then reverse them in esc configurator??,"yes, these numbers match the esc numbers in the configurator. so if motor 2 spins the wrong direction in betaflight, reverse esc 2 in the configurator and write that setup with your battery plugged into the quad. the esc should beep and it should then work. youll see the option there in betaflight to reverse motor direction, im assuming you are not using that."
"yeah 1, 2 and 3 are reversed. so ill reverse them in esc configurator??","if 1 2 and 3 spin the wrong way, yes. you change that drop down tab to reversed, and write them.. after that if you read them again it should say reversed on those motors yes ive done that and checked in betaflight and everythings up and running. thank you so much No problem good to hear it mind you you do want to run props out"
Is learning to solder a big thing for this hobby?,its getting a bit late here and ive got college tomorrow so ill try arming it up again tomorrow evening and ill let you know how it goes.. again thank you so much for your help :slightly_smiling_face: Yes absolutely. Awesome. I just got out of my class too lol. Why think about what happens when you run into objects haha. well thank you for giving me your time The alternative was paying attention so i didn't miss out on much lol np. I wind up hitting grass and trees more often and I would rather have wet grass cover the front of my camera than have it be launched into my stack. But if you have a racing build or a smaller build or something else... I think it's just situational you can cover your stack and still have the benefits
Wouldn't that make the esc or fc more likely to overheat or no?. Why isnt that the bf default anyways then,that'd be surprising and worrying whether or not you have guards on the side
How many hours would you say it takes to get a good understanding of it?,"not even one. You need to primarily make sure you get good soldering gear and solder, if you don't have that you will have a hard time i watched like 2 videos on youtube with good explenations. should suffice Well that makes me feel better. Now back to trying to figure out flight controllers and figuring out soldering gear I hope"

However, some sites have stacks listed seperately from autopilots (mostly dedicated for pixhawks) Is there a difference?",that's basically the exact stacks you want to avoid. v3 has severe issues FC design wise v4 has an incredibly unreliable ESC
i think i have one of those in my cinewhoop. :skull:. a v3 i think. bruh i used to get a mamba stack for like 40 bucks. was it reliable? eh. was it 40 bucks? hell yeah. i miss cheap parts,"Pixhawks are just like normal flight controllers with some having some extra features like a co-processor. can get one nowadays for 60 thats a 50% increase in price. pain what you mainly want to check is if ardupilot already has a target for your FC that you're picking idk man, thats how i got to the speedybee for a 30x30 stack here's some good brands: Skystars, Diatone, Airbot, Sequre, iFlight, XRotor and probably more most of those are made in contact with Betaflight for the most part.

Is this gap on my hdo2 normal?. I guess not but I can’t get it to close,Looks like they were opened. The cables inside are very annoying to route as designed. Possible there are pinched wires in there.  Forcing it closed is not a good plan here. I opened it. Guess im not good at it :slightly_smiling_face: Nobody is. Even fatshark support :face_with_tears_of_joy: Back when it existed. Take time to twist tape and keep wires out of pinch points as you assamble it.
What tape?. The flat cables?,"Its usually the power board silicone wires that are hardest. Anything that holds OK but is easy to remove as needed. I like painters tape for that usually. The Reciver plug cable is the worst. The right side closes perfectly it’s the left that won’t Check if the IPD of the lens is lined up with the case. I did but that could have been it Why is this happening, i flashed my firmware and now any preset that I try to use says it had errors I did it!!. It was the black plastic hoding the lenses.

"Hi all. So I bought a pair of brushless motors, and I tried to loosen the Shaft from outer case. Setscrews were there to loosen. The Allen key slipped and now it's kinda not grabbing and the Shaft isn't moving either. Anyway I can solve this problem?. Kinda tensed :skull:",Cram larger hex in there. Glue or solder a tool in there. Ez-out. Best of luck.
Could you explain a bit more? Sorry I'm a complete newbie with stuff like this,"That kind of retaining screw is often called a grub screw. The way to deal with it kinda really depends on what tools you have. So honestly punch ""remove stripped grub screw"" into google and watch some videos to get an idea of solutions.   If you dont have much tool wise. Just buy a replacement now. Even with right tools this kind of repair can go wrong very easily and trash the motor.  If you do anything involving making metal shavings such as grinding or drilling. I'd advise you to use tape and fully seal and enclose the motor first. To prevent shavings from getting inside the motor. Damn alright. Thank you very much"
did you try to set the output size to something more common?. like 1280x720?. sometimes encoders are touchy about that kinda stuff. can you show the whole settings? advanced and shiz. what does the button next to output size do?,"nope. imma just sacrifise my cpu ig. i figured out the problem and there isnt a way around it I was recording in 1080 60 and that only gives h265, I should use 4k 60 to get h254 ... we're talking about export tho oh. idk then :PepeBigHmm: shows all the resolutions this program is stupid like if it would at least tell you WHY it's disabled. this is like that whole patrick wallet meme"

"well the 6 inch prop survived, but will an 8 inch survive? It will break the sound barrier btw","I'd def go with carbon. Aeronaut is probably the manufacturer to go for.  Or graupner, but be sure to get the E series ones that are intended for higher RPM on electric motors.  Also idk your project but keep safety in mind when you do this. If it does explode, the potential for very serious injury should not be overlooked/underestimated."
Safety is the first priority and it will be run on a field. so something like this one? https://www.amazon.com/VERBANA-Propeller-Quadcopter-Hexacopter-Accessories/dp/B0CTH1HRH1/ref=sr_1_6?crid=37E74504UJYLH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.67BzJ5eu8giZHRKGnNOP3K2b2OASm4iMk42CNzI-qmoAFGVZaXgNhqoJfkcQOQ-kv8lzuz-6B_uQ3VMEJ5yMyTHBz_M_4psc4QK7nT0VrTcLWkpdlBj0i_LKtYTcTOswsiDhgJcFWBInNBw-9oPDfKYZC7kaV64GHpcsazaOHRQuc_qMqp-SxY_5jq9njmSO0xNaX2rEQA1wS9d8eHcT0O-x2kstYIM8STmBOZQfGPRP4_ya27jWAExMKhgzl8OgoFKOpUsPwJjqo21VEf8FRrnvKT_JDU2F6wsIpMWFKRU.5efgmAAjMArp6j3cuHtJ8NQ1xPFbjk9xO4Dy1bN7OcY&dib_tag=se&keywords=carbon+fiber+drone+prop+8+inch&qid=1725978132&sprefix=carbon+fiber+drone+prop+8+inch%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-6,Also be sure to get the proper adapter rings for your prop/motor shaft. You really wanna also balance the props you get before use.
yea.. and should I go for the 3 bladed props or 2 bladed?,"If RPM is the goal then less blades means less resistance means less power used. Less chance to cook the motor/esc or to hit amp limitations. Go 2 blades. Torque isn't a problem with the motor that I am using I'd go with this brand instead, simply because I have used them a lot and have experince with them. https://hackermotors.us/product/aeronaut-cam-carbon-light-prop-8x4-5/. also note this important info: https://tenor.com/view/chuckles-im-in-danger-ralph-wiggum-the-simpsons-gif-14149962"
"well judging that the 6 in prop survived, Hopefully the 8 inch one will too.. and are glass fiber nylon better or worse than carbon fiber props at these rpms?",TBH taking any prop to 2X+ its RPM range is gonna be a gamble to what will or will not explode. My logic behind using carbon is that it's less likely to deflect or flatten out. Which would put more strain on it and be more likely to boom.  But really its anyone's guess. :man_shrugging:
"I never touched carbon fiber irl so I dont know how strong it is lol. and would aluminum be less likely to explode, or more due to the higher weight?",aluminium props sound like a terrible idea These are questions for someone that designs propellers for a living. You might wanna look into contacting a prop maker.  Or look into doing whatever this project is by some other means. Yea. I think ima buy some of those carbon fiber props and see if they blow or not. I have a feeling they will explode though cause the one 6 inch prop did about 10lbs of thrust
"Yo, rel quick question.. Im thinking to upgrade my Fpv google to hdzero, i have fatshrek hdos rn, but the question is…..( what do i exactly need to fly analog with hdzero googles?) just a side module for49$? As i see, pro pilots use no analog thingie on their googles?. So am bit vonfused, like should i order analog adapet or nay","Yeah you need the adapter to take your analog module from your HDO's and put it on the HDZero goggles. If you are seeing PPL not using that adapter, they are probably just flying HDZero. or perhaps using an external analog ground station for analog video. Prop guards or no on a 3.5"". The GEPRC domain frame looks kinda sick if you don't need prop guards. never do them Imma try to export everything to ProRes or smth idk"
what format is the file?,"MP4 if I remember correctly but I just turned off my pc check if it really is mp4 alternatively try mkv. or the other way around i have moeny for props so i dont need them @FpvByAlex I'm wondering if it's just the container that's not supported I will check later, going to bed coz I have work"
"eh?. container = mp4, mkv, avi, etc",the fact that the vids don't have thumbnails is a bit weird too tho Ye. What should I do :blessed: tell me what it is when you get around to it :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. you can remux stuff to a different container. without reencoding. it's pretty quick Ight man thank you for the help.

guys my ev800d's are playing random netflix movies how do i fix this????. did i get hacked??,also thats the vr03 or something i just ended up watching nimona. its a movie i quite like. and its helping me recover from you ruining my joke
"I just replaced my X12 with a CrazyF405 cause I'm converting the whoop to walksnail (I now realise I could've just disabled the X12's VTX by removing the power bridge), but I'm getting a constant drift with the new board, almost like there's constant right roll being applied, filters and PID changes don't seem to make any difference, does that sound like a faulty board or is there something else I could be missing?. I've tried reflashing, and made sure its not TX/RX related as it sits still on the receiver tab in BF",WHY IS IT SO LONG. i can feel my face being compressed just looking at it Stock Ev800d is a little longer just discovered my mob6 pigtail is a bit broken. so i gotta fix that now. im updating the escs and bf right now
Did you calibrate your sticks / touched the trim switches ?,"Yeah checked all that, on the receiver tab in BF its all good, no movement"
"If you go into your radio menu and go to the page where you can see the values of each channels, or they all at 0 ? (Except for throttle that should be at -100 and switches that should be -100/0/100)","Yeah, they're all 0 and I've made sure ADC filter is disabled"
does the drift happen in that first setup tab in bf?. that would show a gyro issue,Nah it seems still in BF on that tab if its just on the bench I might try get a replacement cause its driving me to my wits end. never seen anything like this before try reflashing bf first
"Just as a sanity check, you are using acro mode right ?",yeh. angle mode becomes unflyable after about 10 seconds because full left stick is no longer enough to keep it level im not a BB expert but a bb log may help i can try get one. but yeh im not exactly sure what to look for iirc the bb viewer will show the quads orientation. idk i would just reflash bf and try again have you flashed betaflight at all yeah I tried going to 4.5.1. and then also 4.4.2. came with 4.3. same issue on all im assuming you have the right target BetaflightF4 is what it says on the manual
what fc is it?. link or model number either or,"love when companies use generic targets https://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2023/05/26/crazyf405hd-elrs-1-2s-aio-fc-built-in-uart-elrs-receiver-and-12a-blheli_s-esc/ configuration tab, is there anything set under the accelerometer trim setting It's not a base MCU target, they're just re-using a different one acc trim is zeroed out.

"if im planning to use the googles x with my drone, what is the best battery to buy for it?",The one that will power your goggles for as long as you want to fly. The Goggles X use about 8.3W. A 4S 1300mAh lipo would get you about 2 hours of runtime. Do not use a 2S lipo.

Is this normal?","hello, i had a question if any expert is here, what are the parameters we look in a fire insulator of a drone, what must a fire insulator have to be used on a drone. that's completely fine. it's what balance charging is for excuse me, what is the best fire resistant battery preferred for drones no clue what to tell you. and I don't really want the responsibility of whatever you're attempting to make either"
"yeah I get that, but why would you need it to be *fire resistant* and not just a normal battery ?","it's for wild fire. and if u have any resources related to wildfire fighting drones or where can i get I don't have any, quite frankly you shouldn't fly the drone inside the wild fire, flying above would be preferable that's what they all say i have been told to check this part. lmao nah im serious that's what they all say I feel like I could copy and paste that same answer a lot of times with you"
"lmao, can u answer some other question if u don't wanna for this?. landing gear related stuff",and redundancy how to increase. why aren't people answering for heat resistant btw
Did you punch any of theese questions into google?,"i tried, i dont get it"
How do you think the battery is the only heat concern? Why would props melting or electronics overheating not be a concern?,by having redundant systems
"because i was checking on Gemini and i ended up on batteries while searching for insulations and wrote a page on lipo4 battery until i go here and someone told it's a bad option because of weight.. how to have redundant systems, what are the parameters or what should we do to have a redundant system, is there any article that can help?","for exemple, if you want to have redundancy on an x4 quad, well you double the motors and make an x8, and now you have redundant motors, for the other parts, you connect the brain cells and do basically the same thing. also, if you end up using it to sell drugs or  airdrop guns to a prison and you need redundancy in case they try to shoot it down, well, don't :loudly_crying_face: lmfao. as i said, its a project selling drugs can be a project too for uni. its from uni"
How is this gonna even help for a fire situation? This theoretical fire resistant drone..,"in case the trees throw fire balls it's a group project mostly with my seniors, they gave me few things to find out regarding the project and i couldn't find on google or should i say i didn't understand so igot here, the things im supposed to look into are, insulations for the whole thing, redundancy, landing gear and how can we improve. yeah but *why* do you need those, what are you going to do with it It seems like this project its out of your depth tho, you havent been able to do any research on diy drone control system, battery tech, or rc redundancy. Like asking if a raspberry pi is adequate for a drone there are firefighting drones Why didnt you start with how to make a drone, and build up to what ever you are trying to make im going to give that info to my seniors who are making that drone so that cann help them and i finish this phase of project and i get a certificate and experience that will help me in both knowledge and career. i was supposed to look for a better option than a raspberry [ie tbh. pie"

A few balls that can cover ~30sq ft.

You wount be able to have a fireproof flying device that can resist the heat, maintain flight in the heat, and carry a substantial payload inside a burning building. If anything the battery on the drone is just going to rupture and contribute to the fire thats why, insulation Did you not read this part the wildfire drones exist already, it's being used in many places The tethered drones that just fly off the side of a building and spray water from a hose seems pretty useful Assuming it can line up to a window or other hole into the fire. I dont see any practical use for drones in firefighting besides possibly scouting ""my drone frame is an a130"" that's the task, u build sommething that'd be capable for that"

"anybody have a recommendation of when Im supposed to land when flying a 1s whoop? honestly i went from 2s to 4s to 1s and only get like 3 mins of flight on an 850mah lipo, but when i then check the voltages unplugged from lil guy its at like 3.8 or 3.7, but im flying all the way down to about 3.4. i have a vision40 1s and an gnb 1s 850mah, hover throttle is about 25% so feels p good there. if anybody has recommendations for batteries plz lemme know","well. make sure you're using a good connector. and you'll have to figure out how low you can go with it still climbing back up to 3.5v. what whoop is it Ye good mate ty! For the spot based off the sag, i should go down to 3.1 to get up to 3.5 ish ish. maybe ill do 3.2 and see. also using bt 2.0 connector on drone and a30 on batt. https://a.co/d/bQafEPm okay but what tinywhoop that's a huge battery for a 75mm whoop. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250. get a folded cell battery, and your drone will fly way better and way nicer. and longer"
I'm not saying no name?. I'm saying get a folded cell battery. read the first sentence in that post,"i was saying for weight, ur good"
like i had a 12 gram and a 15.5 gram batt and they both hovered at 25% throttle. what type of cells are GNB batts?,"shitty normal ones. just normal LiPo's, not folded. seriously, grab a tattu or betafpv lava 5-pack for like 20 bucks and try it out"
https://a.co/d/dsM6bAe. ?,"yup, although that's a little overpriced. but it is amazon I guess"
hmmm. about 5 bucks more but i get amazon delivery speeds. worth?. do they make 2s in that same sort of folded cell style?,I don't think so. at 2s the point of it starts diminishing
"besides the list you linked, is there any other brands doing that folded cell style?",It's just greprow (Tattu) that has the capability right now. and all the other brands are just rebranding the greprow cells alright i got the lava 550s. ima test em to the 850s for flight time and go from there don't actually know flight time wise. I'd hope the 850mAh is better. but the folded cells will definitely perform better
Is  the betafpv cetus x hd with the walksnail hd cam compatible with DJI goggles?,"BetaFPV has lava 2s but I dunno if they’re folded cell I highly doubt they are well,  they advertise them as being folded, and it is the exact same dimensions as their 550mah 1s folded cells. and since they use the same battery size, I really don't see why it wouldn't be just two of their grepow batteries glued together they might make the cells themselves tho, at least when I see this page that's what it make me think about don't buy a cetus, they suck, very hard, and no, walksnail is not compatible with dji goggles You assume correctly, the Z-fold process is the same Grepow process for these. Haven’t seen any other retailers with 2S folded packs though hm ok, also tinywhoop makes some - The Tiny Whoop 2S series batteries use the world's finest premium folded cells <https://www.tinywhoop.com/collections/batteries/products/tiny-whoop-2s-95c-7-6v-hv-450mah> <https://www.tinywhoop.com/collections/batteries/products/tiny-whoop-2s-95c-7-6v-hv-300mah> (i'm a touch skeptical on these since they aren't skinny like the other 300mah 1s)"
With a BT3.0 plug? Bet they’re just sourcing them from BetaFPV and rebranding. That would make the most sense to me,"I don't think so, not for the 300mah one at least since betafpv doesn't do a 300mah 2s, but even for the 450mah, since betafpv uses a cap and them they have it on a pigtail, if they did it would mean they are buying the cells->removing the cap>removing the bte.0>removing the shrink wrap->putting a pigtail->adding a shrink wrap, except if they get them from betafpv with a pigtail and all that already on, which I kinda doubt, i'm just going to send them an email about it, it will be much faster than debating over something we ultimately don't know, I will ping you the answer if you want to Sure that’d be nice. I appreciate you’"
Just accidentally ripped of the plug were you connect the wire between the 4in 1 ESC and the flight controller. Im wondering if the solder pads in the top of the flight controller can be used for the same thing. Does anyone know?,how did you rip off the plug it didn't seem like it was all the way in so i pushed harder and it broke.:loudly_crying_face:
"I dunno, what's the pinout on your ESC?","Not sure, but it looks like this. connect GND to G, Bat to V, M1 to 1, M2 to 2, M3 to 3, M4 to 4, and Cur to C. unsure what your 1 dangling wire after that would be for. perhaps checkc onnectedness with your meter on both sides to see what pad corresponds to what pin in the plug"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) very dumb question. Why use a single ESC over using multiple ESCs 1 for each motor?,Individual ESC'S have a few benefits:  If one dies you replace one not 4. They get better cooling out on the arms and can usually be pushed harder or more aggressively. Mainly back in the day 4in1's were nowhere near as reliable as individuals. Individual ESC'S were easier back in the day to manage and diagnose video noise issues. (This is a way bigger deal than it sounds like) [LC filters and the like did not exist for no reason] you always have multiple escs
yeah but why use a 4in1 instead of having them separated on the arms?,Easier to build. Less wiring issues to troubleshoot.. To re iterate. Back in the day individual ESC'S was the norm. Eventually at some point the cost/durability of 4in1 took over.. That's it.. In theory its 111% possible for individuals to take back over with proper design and implantation.  It's just no longer in the $$ demand
wait how are 4in1s more durable than individual ones?. I would think that 4in1s would be more prone to failures,"They R not ""more durable""  They at durable enough to withstand and bear the costs. they're also not exposed on the arms. which is a lot safer I could chase and replace any of the 4 individual ESC'S on a rig and do the guess and check nonsense.  Or for a bit more $$ maybe 20-40$ I can just replace all of them. No nonsense. No troubleshooting. No nothing. Just an extra 20$.  This is what killed individual ESC'S.. To clarify I was  one of thoos PPL pulling fets off individual ESC'S to slap them on another. At some point the time outweighs the cost. :man_shrugging:. To again reiterate. Probably half my shit is individual ESC'S. But cost/time wise these days I can not reccomend the same route I took years and years ago. Technology moves fast."
Anyone know how to use the walksnail goggles x for analog?,av adapter and analog module
"Hey everyone, quick question. First time flying internationally (Canada to US) with my drone/batteries and charger on Flair Airlines. Anything I should be careful of or mindful?   Also should I have the drone batteries (750 MaH, 11.4 Wh) on storage voltage or completely discharge them?","na i didnt take any videos of it at all yet. I finished it after it was dark out and for whatever reason that camera is crappy so I'll probably replace it with a different on I have anyways. I also want to totally redo the camera and vtx mounting, I just designed and 3d printed that real quick to see if it would work at all. the rubber bands do work really well, although it doesnt look as neat as id like overall yet lol Yeah but janky looks cool on toothpicks id really like to fix that esc but I think im just gonna live with it. well. the rubber band part is fine. the vtx wiring the rear is awful. i did not make it easy to solder. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) oh also pyro sent me a free set of betafpv 1404s, one of which has a shortened wire set that was cut so they werent brand new. i have a spare 30x30 fc and 4 20a escs that could handle 3s. however those escs run multishot. so i dont think im gonna touch it for now. but its tempting Probably why it was free i dont remember if its storage or discharged but they wont have a voltmeter to check anyways. ive heard its good advice to package each lipo in a ziplock so its guaranteed they cant short to anything and its clear to TSA. yeah im sure it was. not sure what ill use em on tho. make sure all your batteries are in carry on baggage no exceptions they i have to buy 3"" props :loudly_crying_face:. everything in this hobby involves spending money. idk if i want to use the multishot escs on it or not. theyre free but no rpm filtering i want this toothpick flying and then im gonna stop buying stuff for a bit and just fly. ive also heard props off and *anything* sharp be in checked baggage, especially tools. apparently props could be considered sharp Ah ok, sounds good, will keep in seeprate ziplock bags!. Yes, saw that on Flairs website. oo, I wont be doing checked baggage... Hopefully they dont check, but I will dismantle the props and put them in the ziplock bag. Mainly cause its like wayyy more expensive then carry on Yes, I got called a terrorist at the airport because I had bi blade props and a soldering iron in my bag I get called a terrorist at the airport for existing"
"And 3""? Are they good for chase/speed flying?","Well, 3.5"" is kinda the default size for any kind of outdoors chasing, you could also look at their mage pro if you wanted a slightly smaller cinewhoop"
whats a vtx protocol?,"probably some bullshit What your VTX uses. Analog, Walksnail, DJI, HDZero and the rest"
Wouldnt analog not have a protocol?. Its just different bands right?,"One of my ESCs doesnt have bidirectional dshot on a 4in1 board, what can I do"
"Ok, is it normal that there are 8 motors listed?","Right like the type of VTX, guess you could call analog and all the other stuff protocols It wont connect (I have colsed BF and all)"
Do you have a battery plugged in?,"That was it thx. I can now control every motor except 2, which is the faulty one in BF too. ESC 2 isnt showing up Try a different cable and keep trying to read settings. what ESC is it Front right of Axisflying eco 60A stack. Still not. It also makes a different startup tone"
from the FC?. I think that is a very bad sign. are you sure its from the FC?,Found it. That fucker straight up chipped. It's brok. Nothings wrong with the esx. I am thinking about upgrading them both tho. :PepeBigHmm: I am personally more of an AIO dude
did you flash the correct target?,"tried flashing the motors yet esc configurator doesnt recognize any motor. yeah Go to the CLI tab in Betaflight Configurator and click `Submit Support Data`, then send the resulting ID here b6882fb0-f740-4210-b872-e9b77e8fb830. even tried flashing the fc again :folded_hands:  thought it was the wrong build or smth seal that thing back up and it's finee Nah. It's munching on electricity. 24 volts turn into 5. Poof. Esc configuration my boy. And check if the wires are parallel"
is the battery actually charged?,"about 22v not charged all the way What Firmware did you Flash on what Esc I'm looking at the support ID now, that was in reply to a different person ah lol. i didn't, thats the problem Yeahh might wanna check that. And look if it recognized each one try flashing again but with most of the crap that speedybee includes removed, the default should look something like this trying rn, ill update if its working after flashing Check the motor cables. BTW 80 cents is crazy Theyre fine. I already bought new caps"
And did you check if the ribbon is fully connected?. The cable connecting FC and esc,"Yep all fine there too...sadly, would have been an easy fix worked! thanks alot!. really weird about all betaflight stuff. couldnt get on this prob alone. thanks alot"
did you check if one of the mosfets is broken?,It came off right in this place usually at the bottom. heres a vid by bardwell blame speedybee for filling it up with this much crap causing further flashes to be misconfigured
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW4a3AnraVk,"i sure love speedybee yeeee. They got a lot of features and [Some] reliability. but else. it poof huh. they have like the bare minimum features. and so far they have the least reliability too. for the same price as other reliable stacks ehhhh I would say that their FCs have more features on paper than most others. how useful they are... up to the user wifi is the only thing i can think of. which is like... okay wireless config, battery meter, SD card is arguably a pretty rare sight nowadays. inb4 I feel like some of those things would be cheaper than doing what the other boards are doing though. like the sd card slot vs onboard I wouldn't want to design around an SD card slot well i use following: bluetooth sd card planning on utilising the uarts Short protection. but tbh competition is also good tbh the F405 V4 FC is *fine* planning on upgrading to it. since my curent v3 is ded the v4 FC is fine but then seemingly the ESC that comes with that is absolutely awful and fails for everyone we got them to put proper work into V3 successors rather than to keep making those shit went trough hell but it outlived the fc it's been fine for me, for very nooby racing and some freestyle it's been not fine for loads of people here. just random deaths it's been a while since I've seen one die. also since there's a fuck ton of these stacks going to... less than experienced people, the apparent failure rate is of course going to be higher yeah but a lot of these have been people where we were able to inspect the esc. and look at it being fine SB has the highest amount of FCs flashed by a big margin"
question. are the Xnova 2208 1900KV overkill for freestyle?,"xnova are great for racing. unsure about freestyle I use 1950kv on all my 5"" builds the majority of people i see now use 1950kV 2207. and the racers are all going for some crazy high kV I wouldn't say majority but it's a lot more common than it used to be. and it is a lot of fun seen houseofdrones use it so why not"
can you get camera feed in ardupilot?. Really now to drones so if its a stupid question let me know,"Fpv feed is separate from the FC operation, mostly"
is doing something like this on my googles for analog cheaper then just geting a cheap pair of 800d?,"thank you. what do you think the issue  is i dunno. i dun even know what you have. or what your problem is. getting no information is fun. show your camera connection @Emilia (XT90 Janklet), it's the camera. I tried a different one and it's working now. I probably screwed something up"
"Is an ESC continuous current characteristic is ""per motor"" or ""overall""?","Afaik it is less of a dumpster fire now that you can buy an actual vtx/vrx for it, but it is still a crappy wifi based link that performs a lot worse than WS (granted I only saw a few videos of it lately)"
"Can i somehow calculate speed of a drone when i know Weight, motor thrust etc.?","It's not that easy, you can easily calculate the theocratical acceleration, but That's about it, it won't take into account drag or how your quad cannot go faster than the air it's pushing backwards  Tho, we can give you a good guess based on our experience. But if you want to get a major in aerodynamics and run a cfd program for 2 weeks, then you probably can figure it out to some level of accuracy I want to buy cineape25 but with GoPro 12 (396g total Weight with battery) And i dunno if i Will be Fast enough to chase bike trails with it I mean, a 2.5"" cinewhoop is not going to be happy with a full GoPro 12 on it, you are really going to want a 3-3.5"" cinewhoop for that (also, Darwin only uses bottom of the barrel components, don't buy quads from them)"
"Isnt 3""-3.5"" too big for in Woods flights?. Do you have any recommendations?","If you can't fly a 3 or 3.5"" cinewhoop in the woods (assuming it's not a really dense forest) you probably shouldn't fly next to people doing bike trails, cause I can freestyle my 5"" in a (not particularly dense) forest. Oddityrc mage pro / XI35 pro (XI35 pro would be better, bigger platform, it will be much better suited for chases)"
Is xl35 better than protek 35?. Or it depends what suits me,"I would pick the XI35 over the protek, but they are both good, the protek is just iflight copying oddityrc At least check what you write.... They're like 2 years apart just by video reviews alone, with the protek being much older. We like oddityrc and mildly dislike iflight, sure... but not the the point of randomly making claims like this Hm, well it might have been with some of the smaller models then (20/25), not the 35, but I usually hear that oddity rc was here first for cinewhoops with slim ducts and the protek line started after The protek 35 don't even have very slim ducts. And there were slim ducts before that"
What are your cinewhoop recommendations? (I need one that can carry gopro 12 And Will be good for bike trail chase,The xi35 is pretty good. Or the geprc Cinelog 35 v2

It's made of cheap parts, assembled even cheaper, and the QA performed is cheaper still.  The result? A Toy-grade setup that doesn't last long but still takes a [decent radio] sized bite from your wallet.",Make sure they're on the same band and channel. nvm i crashed it:skull_and_crossbones:
They’re all relatively similar?,"As long as bt2.0 it says, bt2.0 connector it will be. Only connector i have had bad experience with is amazon t-deans for airsoft use, but then again those are high torque.   Point of failure was the plates melted the plastic a bit why would you use an xt30 on a tinywhoop Bt2.0 is only made by betafpv. They have a patent on it, they are the only one who makes them Oh wow that’s actually really cool, thanks for letting me know. Xt30 is dumb heavy for a tinywhoop, except if you want to do a 2s 85/95mm then maybe, but bt3.0 is actually a pretty decent lighter option if you don't mind the small amount of compatible batteries I didn’t even know bt 3.0 existed A30 is also a thing, it’s BT2.0 at home"
"So for my emax thf2, i want to upgrade connector. Is XT30 ok? It would be like 2s battery i would use instead of the 2x 1s it uses now","Yes, that’s what you should do"
plus the upgraded vtx + antenna it should give similar range to the video i posted no?,You really really want to use xt30 on it. Yeah
"You have no money, schools, libraries or local contacts?. or even makerspaces?",I just got the SKYZONE SteadyView for my DJI v2 googles and I was wondering if anyone had idea for me to mount it so far I was thinking on top with tape yk Don’t have access to that If I would it would be online buying it. I figure for now mounting it on top with tape until I get like a mount would be fine just a little funky
wait so you gotta X the ammount of batterys amps that are on the boar? i didnt know that,"Ive been charging my speedypizza 6s 1200mah batterys for 200 mins now is this normal im running a balance board with 4 lipos on it 1.2amp charging (They have never took this long to charge before but ive only charged them like 2-3 times now they are still cold) if you have 4 1200mAh batteries in parallel charging, thats 4*1.2Ah=4.6Ah. To charge them at 1c you would need 4.6A, not 1.2A. 1.2A is just fine, but it will take 4 times as long to charge them. thats the bonus of using a parallel charger board to save time"
"yeah you should probably do a bit of reading on how batteries work. do you know anything about how capacity, C rating, and voltage (parallel vs series) works?. i have those exact batteries btw lol","ive been charging lipos for a long time but i never took notice of how long they take to charge but i always thought charging over the 1C is bad for them these have 5c max you are correct. you should charge at 1c, or I charge at 2c if im in a rush. however. one of those batteries is six cells in series, each cell is 1200mah. 1200mah is capacity, so the cell can be discharged at 1200milliamps for one hour before it is dead. or 1.2ams for one hour, same thing. one cell is about 3.7 volts, more or less when charged or dead. one of your batteries has 6 of these cells, wired in series so the voltage adds but the capacity is the same you explaining it to me way better than the internet does lmao thanks no problem lol. so these are 4s and 2s battery diagrams with each cell. and then the top connector is your main xt60 and the bottom connector is the balance lead. the positive and negative of each cell is connected, and that is called **series** or S. hence 6S is 6 cells in series. this shows series and parallel. in parallel the batteries are connected like that, so that would be a 2p battery instead of a 2s battery at the bottom. this means your voltage is the same, but your amperage/capacity is doubled"
so if im ever balance charging i need to do X the ammount of amps of each battery on the board total? this makes sense now ive wondered why its taking my field charger so long to charge them typically ive been waiting around 90 mins to charge 2 say ive got 530mah 2s batteries and a 4 port balance board i need to do 2.4amps instead of 0.6?,"you technically wired your 4 6s batteries in parallel to make a 6s4p battery, so you get 4 times the capacity, at the same voltage. it also means you can run 4 times the amperage always thought all the cells make up 1200mah not each cell is 1200mah yup, each cell is 1200mah, but each cell is only 3.7 volts. they add to make 22.2volts in series. if you wired them in parallel you would have a 3.7v 4800mah battery. you did both, so its like charging a 6s4p battery, which is 22.2v at 4800mah youve explained to me how a balance charger works lmao i never knew. it all makes sense now though 1c for 4800mah is 1 * 4800mah, so 4.8a. haha awesome. this is good info to know so you dont blow yourself up xD seems ive been tickle charging it ive only ever charged 1 battery at a time when i never had drones and had rc cars. (im gonna stop speaking here now bec i think you not supposed to flood this channel) two 540mah batteries is 2*540 since they are in parallel to get 1.08a, just use 1.1a. na its ok, theres no one else in here we're bothering"
wait so i can get all my batteries charged in an hour? doing it properly now,"trickle charging is really for different chemistrys, lipos dont really like trickle charging. nimhs can though it even takes my little batterys very long to charge. bec i didnt do what you said"
what charger setup do you have?,"extronix powerpal3 with my own balance board. not sure what board it is. bought it a long time ago keep in mind its not the ports, its the number of batteries on the parallel board. two batteries is two times their capacity"
i need to buy a drone field charger any reccomendations? im using a uhm 256wh power bank. yea i get what you mean,ehhhh yeah i wouldnt use that charge lmao its kinda crummy. and yes actually i do have a good recommendation. i think it was reccomended by my model shop when i had rc cars. ive seen everyone use the q6. is it any good
"yeah the q6 is good, i have a few others you can look at though too. wdym power bank?. like what kind",power house. its what i use for field charging but it takes ages but you just told me why it takes ages
"oh ok interesting. yeah lol. ok so first of all, your current charger plugs into the AC outlet on there, right? and it plugs right into your wall at your house?",plugged into house when im not out charging. when im out charging it goes into the bank. its same power as an outlet just limited mah
do you know what AC/DC power is? the difference?,"no i dont. ive never used the dc but. bit* so DC power is what we use with all of our phones, tablets, drone stuff, anything with a battery. one wire is postive, one wire is negative, power always flows that direction. for very complicated reasons, its more efficient for them to design houses and buildings with AC which switches positive and negative back and forth. you cant just plug the q6 into your wall, because it takes DC input. however. if you have any random laptop powersupply laying around, thats exactly what they do. they take AC from the wall, and put out DC to charge your laptop. you can also buy one if you dont have one. but the q6 and all the other nice chargers take DC input my old charger had a laptop power bank connected to it but it exploded a cap in it ok well :face_with_tears_of_joy: you need one that works"
i would need to use the dc lighter port outlet if i wanted a q6? for field charging. i fixed it but after a couple of weeks it exploded again so i just threw it away. it was one of those old blue ones,"That would work. However, what is that usbc port rated for Yes, and it will be more efficient. You should however check to see if there is an amp limit on there so you dont pull to much power 60w but when charging my phone it only seems to pull 13w Because your phone can only take 13w. What’s the car cigarette port rated for i charge it with a 60watt plug charger though Yes. Which it requests 13w from. Probably the standard 5v 2a how come my actual plug does super fast charging then i dont get it. when i plug my plug into the power house it also does 60w super fast charging its an EcoFlow RIVER 2 Portable Power Station but i cant find the specs yea im trying to find the amp rn so some phones use different protocols. its complicated and stupid because companys only want you using their chargers Basically trying to see if you should use the usb c or the car port car port would most likely be better"
wouldnt you need a usb pd attachment to get more than 5v out of it though?,"There’s usbc to xt60 cables i would use the car port for simplicity, but check the current limit before you use it oh here we go Car Input: 12V/24V, 8A, 100W Max. AC Input:220-240V 50Hz/60Hz, 360W Max. USB-C Input/Output: 5/9/12/15/20V, 3A, 60W Max Or I’m pretty sure the chargers are set up to request high PD wattages"
"do they include a usbpd circuit though, and what voltage does it request?","heres the dc. DC Output:12,6V, 8A, 100W Max. 8 amps. it all seems to be 8 amps ok wait we gotta do another electronics lesson real quick. watts is total power i swear you an eletrican volts X amps = watts. your batteries are 22, eh, 24v 20v 5a. So the full 100w. No reason not to, all the chargers can take up to 24-ish"
so if i plug it into dc a q6 charger it would pull the full 100w at 8 amps? or 5amps,so lets say 24v*1.2A=28.8W
eltricity is so confusing lmao. the voltage times the amps shows the wattage?,"your car port delivers 12v, 12v*unknown=28.8W,    28.8/12=2.4a Says it’s rated for 200 learning alot of stuff rn lmao volts X amps = Watts, or TOTAL POWER. haha Depends on what voltage and amperage it’s charging at obviously theres a learning curve It can do up to 200w, it doesn’t always do it brb for a second need to goto toilet"
i have no clue what that means. also jason my batterys charged in 13 mins?????. i just looked at the charger. it was on for 200 mins before though,"if you charge your 4 6s batteries at 4.8a, you are going to pull 9.6 amps from your battery bank, or more for ineffiencys. they were probably almost full lol. get a proper charger, it will show that info Voltage is pressure, amperage is flow rate (liters/second) pretty sure the charger i have currently is mega innefficant"
"there is some progress to it, still in maturity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZU2tDar7U",where does the extra amp come from 4.8 * 2 = 9.6. which extra amp. your batteries are double the voltage as your power supply I thought you said 4 batteries therefore they will pull half the current
"ok, ill explain the conversion step by step. lets say you charge your 4 6s batteries at 4.8a, right?","thats roughly 24v*4.8a=115.2w watts is total power, so your charger will need 115.2 watts from your battery bank. your battery bank is 12 volts i get you know you timing the battery voltage against the amps im putting in, its pulling to make the wattage. ive just made my text very confusing right, and now we're going to do the same thing backwards for the battery bank. thats ok lol. so your charger needs 115.2 watts. Volts X amps = watts. 12 volts X unknown amps = 115.2 watts. then you do algebra"
i only got 100watt so i should only charge 2 batteries at once?,"You can just charge slightly slower we'll get to that, lets do the math first almost done lol. yes gonna be completely honest i never really went to school to know whjat that is lmao. yea or that but 80% of time im not gonna be charging the full 4 bec i only got 4 max anyways still good to know what i could put in thought if that situation ever occures"
"thats ok, you basically just solve this equation to find how many amps are pulled. the answer is 9.6 amps. your limit on the battery bank was 8 amps right?",so the whole point of what im trying to explain 12.6v dc 8amp 100w max
"is that just because you are charging your batteries at 4.8a, does NOT mean that you are under the 8 amp limit on the battery bank. does that make sense?","i need to think a little im not gonna lie im getting a bit lost. oh yea the 22v * 4.8amp. thing thats ok ill give you a second, ive been doing this for a few years now so its easier for me to imagine Make them do the math i cant even imagine lmao eletricity is some wizard type stuff the crazy part is i kinda suck at electricity. kermans got a point, you can try to do the same math i just did for yourself what if im charging using the ac output because its showing no ampage. AC Output: Pure Sine Wave, 300W total (surge 600W), 230V 50Hz/60Hz. but seeing people are using dc for their field chargers i should be using dc if i ever get one ah ok, take a look at the voltage on AC. 230 volts ive actually forgotten how to get the battery thing if you do the math on that for your 4 6s batteries, it would only be half an amp ah i think. huh. my brain not comprehending"
"yes, your battery bank batteries are in DC. the bank converts it to AC, then your power supply (laptop power supply?) will convert it back to DC for the charger. its inefficient","plugs straight into the charger currently you've got to recognize the whole volts X amps = watts thing lol oh so im losing alot of power using the ac you have a power supply inside your current charger i should be using the dc bec the + - thing. you said right. the conversion is just inefficient would i need one of these or would it just blow the q6 up bec theres no power laptop thing that would work fine for the DC car charger port and the q6. the laptop power supply (or whatever other powersupply) converts AC into DC, so you would need one for charging off a wall outlet"
100w max. 22v * 4.8amp. 105volts. i mean. watts?,"but thats with 100% efficency. thats impossible now hold on, we're going to do it backwards as well So, from that, 12*x=100 yeah all of our math is 100% effieceny ignore that for now. and yes, it is over the limit. so it wont work. but yeah, like kerman is saying im going to show you how to do that backwards now"
backwards?. thats gonna confuse me even more,"With volts and amps you can find watts, so obviously with volts and watts you can find amps math always works both directions. you just solved how many watts were required to charge your batteries at a certain voltage and amperage. however, we know you only have 100w to work with, and we know the voltage, so you can solve it for amperage. then you just charge your batteries slower wait if i charge a single battery using the dc at 1.2amps its fine because 22v * 1.2amps = 26watts"
"yup, thats fine. how about 3?","2 batterys fine too 52 watts. 78watts but thats beinh 100% efficant right, and thats fine dont worry about that right now you think the extra is enough yes. but. not done yet. try 4 batteries at 0.8a yo whats going on withmy spelling my brain overloading or something lmao i keep misspelling efficient"
wait timing voltage against amp = watts. so. 17 watts?. just say 18 watts. bec its .76,"same thing as this, just .8 instead of 1.2. try doing 4 batteries at .8a per battery 17.6watts. oh 4 batteries right. so you can charge 4 batteries at once"
well it only takes 70 watts doesnt it?,im gonna write this down before i make an explosion How about let’s do the math to find the max amps but lets say that your charger is exactly 80% efficient. im trying to get there man im trying :face_with_tears_of_joy: :loudly_crying_face:. gotta literally teach algebra first. cant be that hard i have no clue what algebra even means. i dropped out of schoo like. 8 years ago
its not that hard. ready for a quick lesson?,"yea im trash with the times table im only good at flying drones lmao. 16 bruh :face_with_tears_of_joy:. i wont stop you from using a calculator all skill points into 1 thing lmao fair enough. ok so. 4x4 is an *expression* and 4x4=16 is an *equation*. its not that important to remember but it could be useful why your q look like that! i used * to make it italics lol oh im getting side tracked anyways. algebra uses a letter to substitute for a number you dont know yet. 4x4=y. find y. 4x4 is 16, so y is 16. thats obvious right OH SO THIS IS WHY THERES LETTERS IN MATH yup. @Sea_Kerman :Harold: you can tell i dropped out lmao this is me. i only found out not very long ago too. lol Specifically you evaluate the left to be 16 so you get  4x4=y  16=y to be fair i failed calculus several times. good point ive never took a test in my life lmao lol. ok so. explaining how to solve v*a=w is rough without this lmao WHAT THE HELL IS THAT. oh the numbers volts*amps=watts. thats all im back in school lmao. aint leant this much for 8 years learnt even my teachers was wack. you the best teacher ive had completely i appreciate it xD. so anyways, we know 4x4=16. we know that 4x4=y and y is 16. how about 4xY=16. whats Y Y is 4, if you have this thing called pattern recognition IVE DONE THIS BEFORE. just came back to my head"
do you know how to do the actual math?,"ok so heres how you actually do algebra WAIT WHY ARE THEY MAKING US GUESS IT. well not guess. calcuate. calc theres no guessing. right anything you do to one side of the = you must do to the other. take the left side and divide the whole thing, which is 8xY but 8. that becomes just Y. take the right side, divide 64 by 8, it becomes 8. you are left with Y=8 yea my head exploded reading this i got mega confused lemme find a diagram its hard to do with words that whole text you just sent i whats the word. i have no clue what it means let me try to just type the steps out in math. 8xY  =  64 (8xY) / 8   =   (64) / 8 (Y)  =  64/8 Y = 8. if you take 8xY and divide it by 8 you just get Y. thats the goal. you want just the letter on one side We want to end up with something that looks like y=<some number> then the other side is the answer first one y is 8  then we know the eh. what are we divding on second one. why is it 8xy or is that just 64. divide 8 if you do anything to one side, you also do it to the otherside So we want to get rid of the 8 next to the y im stuck on this bit rn which is why we divide it by 8 (Y)  =  64/8. y is still 8 right look at the line above that one. you dont know what Y is yet. but yes, technically y is 8 the entire time, it never changes. but pretend you dont know We divided 8xY by 8 so now we need to divide the other side by 8 8xy = 64 y is 8     8xY (64) divide 8 = 8. HUH. oh. pretend the whole idea is to solve for Y. im not sure what youre doin here ngl i thought i know what im doing you might need to watch some youtube videos of people solving them or something Slightly harder one:   8xY = 24 i learned this in 7th or 8th grade i think charging batteries too hard lmao im getting someone else to charge them! Not using square numbers should make things more obvious thats the grade i got kicked from school lmao. inbetween 7-8th"
"kerman has a good idea, do you know where to start with that?",What would be the first step What is the first step yes but you guessed didnt you i calculated it. 8 / 24. got me 3 ok how about 108xY = 54 But *why* do you divide it
i actually dont know lmao. maybe bec it makes the total?. or like,"Yes which is why I wanted you to go step by step because you want the end to be Y = number how many numbers fit inside that one 108xY=37. you can do it on a calculator but you cant guess it No no let’s make this harder thats weird it a decimel. 2.9 yes. i wanna see what kerman makes Introduce addition, make it multiple steps im learning more than teachers have ever taught me ngl idk if thats even englisdh. english that word is familir. familiar So you have to do the equation balancing save that somewhere lmao"
wait. whats all this caclulating for. ive done too muhc thinking ive forgotten. much. is it the ampage?,"to solve volts X amps = watts. you want to find the amperage how would i do it backwards. OH At this point it’s to teach you basic algebra because the educational system has failed you It’s a matter of principle yes yes and yes, all of the above both of you xd"
1.2AMPS x 22 voltags = 22.4 watts     22.4watts / 22 volts = 1 amp?,ok that dsont look right. dont 1.2*22 does not give you 22.4 i though ti got it then! lets start with the right numbers first of all OH. i did it wrong. 26.4 slow down lol. lets say your charger is 80% efffient for the sake of the explanation 1.2AMPS x 22 voltags = 26.4 watts     26.4watts / 22 volts = 1.2 amps ive done it backwards now. thats weird. i swear ive got it!
well that statement was correct but its not what we're looking for. it was correct. just not helpful. you have 4 batteries right?,lets say you charge them at 24 volts. in reality it varies but we will say 24
4 batteries  105watts / 22 volts 4.8amps?,"where did you get 105 your battery bank can do 100. dont do that yet so its already too high youre doing it forwards. we want to do it backwards. you get 100 watts. im gonna give you full reign in 2 minutes lmao. you get 100 watts, and 24 volts"
max i got 100watts 100watts divid 22 volts? max amps  i can use with these batteries? but thts 100% efficant. oh we doing 24 volts,24 makes it rounder. technically it would be 4.2*6 cells is 25.2 max voltage. just use 24 we will do 100% effiecen this time. YUP lemme write this down so i dont forget
"you can charge all 4 batteries at 4.1 amps safely, if it was 100% efficient. dont actually use 4.1 because its not 100% efficient. lets say your charge is 85% efficient. do you know how to find the amps?","is this right  btw. wattage / voltage = amp. amps x voltage = wattage w, v, and a are your letters im just using full words bec its gonna be more easy to me https://www.amazon.com/HTRC-Precision-Analyzer-Battery-Voltage/dp/B06XPVKY13/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_pp if you divide both sides by voltage, you get the top equation hey i got one of those somewhere i think my charger will do the same thing i use to check voltage after driving rc cars i would get a toolkitrc charger but theres some options wait so how do i caclulate so its not 100% efficent. bec rn its 100%. thats impossible irl its going to be .85 (85%) times 100 watts heat n stuff using eletric just so you know. ive never done percentage. idk how it works a percentage is just a decimal. 100% is 1.00. 90% is 0.90. 49.8% is 0.498. 85% is going to be 0.85 times 100 watts. how many watts do you get we using 85% of the power that would be 85% efficient, yes let me write this down learning percentage lets go. could never do it lmao. lmk when youre ready To avoid you cheating and intuiting it, let’s make it *all* letters No, a pencil helps a lot for this kerman wait give me 30 seconds to finish this lmao"
ok riz. ignore that for a minute. how many watts do you have?,yes. how many amps can you charge at 24 volts i gotta do it backwrds dont i. eh its the exact same thing you did with 100 watts. exact same the percent thing just changed 100 to 85. thats all before it was 24 volts X (unknown) amps = 100 watts this power bank shows the wattage being drawn btw. ive plugged phone it its pulling 13 watts off track :face_with_tears_of_joy:  but ok oh wait this is whats confusing me. ok im sidetracked now unsidetrack. how did you do this for 100 watts not 85 amps. youre solving for amps
oh mixed up. 85 watts. what do i have to find. the voltage?,"You have volts and watts you did this correctly here lmao. amps. volts X amps = watts. you have 24 volts per battery. you have 85 watts instead of 100. 24 volts X (unknown) amps = 85 watts @Sea_Kerman its all you now :face_with_tears_of_joy: 1 second ill get this one. sop About to arrive home, give me like 5 mins. Ping me or something i divided 24 volts against 85 watts. unless thats wrong. this is hwat i got written down wattage / by voltage = amps volts x amps = watts yes. technically its 85 divided by 24 but yeah you did it right. thats how you do that trying to figure out how i do the battery thing with 85% now 85% efficiency at 100 watts. so you have 85 watts. and you solve it v*a=w. and you got 3.5. youre done gonna be honest ive lost myself. how like. WOW it gets worse before it gets worse. this is where i started failing classes. lmao WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE BIG S DOING Infinite adding of infinitely small slices thats a definite integral. lmfao"
wait so to charge 4 batterys id need to be 3.5 amps?,To convert from rates to total
you wanna take it now kerman?. 4 24v batteries at max speed with a 100W power output and 85% efficiency,"this is what ive written down yes. if you have a larger power supply, like 200 watts, you can just charge them at max speed that the batteries will take. which is 1200mah*4=4800ma or 4.8a batteries  wattage /  by voltage = amps   volts x amps = watts  max dc charging is 100w 8 amps  max ac charging is 300w-600w  100% is 1.00 90% is 0.90  we want to use 85% of power because not 100% efficient so   0.85 times 100watts = 85 watts  1200mah 22.2 volts   1.2 amps x 22 volts = 26.4 watts   85% efficency    4 batteries 1200mah 3.5amps 24v  530mah 7.6 volts  0.6 amps x 7.6 volts = 4.56watts. this is what ive got written down. with ac you can goto 300 watts Also watts/amps=volts i think this is all correct. yes, you can charge faster but youll drain your bank even faster because of lower efficiency With physics you’ll see a lot of equations that are   a*b=c  a=c/b  b=c/a i dont got dc rn so its gonna have to do thats ok. yeah honestly its more practical to just be given those if you dont know algebra"
so if i was using ac i can use 105 watts 105 watts/ 22.2v = 4.7amps?,"@Riz copy this down as well thats 100% effic again Watts, amps, volts  volts, ohms, amps  speed, mass, momentum yea i put it near the top. im writting it all down on my phone. im going out to a drone meet tommorrow dont want to blow everyone up yes, although idk where 105 came from gonna try remeber where i got it from"
"also, you know the voltage of a battery changes when its charged vs dead right?","charged its like 4.2 volts to me i think. i land at 3.4 volts i think its because you said 22.2*4.7=105... oh 105 is too high. is what you were thinking i look at the cell count yep, and those numbers are per cell, so on a 6s its 6 times that number. @Sea_Kerman  its all you if you want to start with real algebra lmao 1.2 amps x 22 volts = 26.4 watts 26.4 watts x4 = 105 watts  105watts / 22 volts = 4.7 amps (4 batteries charging using ac) max ac is 300w im using 105 watts max amps is 8 amps im using 4.7. but thats 100% eff again stop hold on. you need to be using units correctly. every single equation should have one volts, one amps, and one watts. i dont see enough amp numbers in those. so something is wrong. 105watts / 22 volts = 4.7 amps this is correct. 1.2 amps x 22 volts = 26.4 watts 26.4 watts x4 = 105 watts this doesnt make sense. theres no amps. so its wrong the x4 at end is bec i got 4 battery"
regardless you dont have any amp numbers?,~~1.2 amps x 22 volts = 26.4 **amps**~~ no no dont read that. ~~you missed that i guess~~ HUH. 26amps that looks really high i messed that up. lmfao. sorry
the batterys?. the mah converted to uh. looking at phone. 1200mah = 1.2amps,"right. and if you have 4 when i divide what i got using the 4.7 ive got 1.15 amps yup. so youre safe, its under 1.2 good. then its ok. :thumbs_up: i feel the brain expanding. im gonna have to do a week worth of lessons on youtube to understand this Ok, algebra lesson  (AxB)/C = D  Let’s solve for A, step by step haha youtube does help, but kerman can explain stuff when you have questions. ill let him do this Here we go to the essence of math, there is no physical significance to any of this  A B C and D are the first 4 letters of the alphabet ive been doing this for almost 3 hours lmao ive written down so much stuff. is it all right. lemme paste it. batteries   I can charge 4 batteries at 4.7 amps using ac bec it's under 8 amps and pulling 105 watts max is 300 wattage /  by voltage = amps   volts x amps = watts  watts/amps / volts  max dc charging is 100w 8 amps  max ac charging is 300w-600w  100% is 1.00 90% is 0.90  we want to use 85% of power because not 100% efficient so   0.85 times 100watts = 85 watts  1200mah 22.2 volts   1.2 amps x 22 volts = 26.4 watts   85% efficency    4 batteries 1200mah 3.5amps 24v  530mah 7.6 volts  0.6 amps x 7.6 volts = 4.56watts yes thats all correct i just need to learn how to do % with it now. well you just showed me. but im not gonna lie it didnt stick. ill get it eventually. wait i think i got it. i think right under `4 batteries 1200mah 3.5amps 24v` add `3.5a*24v=85w`"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NybHckSEQBI. go watch this lmao,"im gonna head to sleep and watch that before i head out flying. thanks for the help you two :thumbs_up: np. gnight. @Rizill dm you some chargers, you dont need to read through them now Ok thanks I think my charger rn is mega inefficient seeing its ac not dc. seeing what you said atleast That one doesn’t explain the part I was going to, so maybe ping me tomorrow"
Radiomaster boxer has the 6400 mah battery inside from RM. It's currently at 8v abd I've doubled checked this with a lipo checker and and on the hota. However I get this low battery sign.    Software fault?,RTC battery is not your normal battery
O?? I'll have a good. Ta,RTC = real time clock
They didn't teach that in the drone school!!!!. So I don't have that specific battery on holiday with me... if that rtc battery goes whilst flying am I fucked? Or will my radio still do its job.,"It should just be for the clock. you should be fine Thank you mate!  Have a shoot planned today cNt be falling out the sky. There is a pirate ship that sales fro. West to east by the beach at noon today!. Need to be flying around that bad boy and with it! the batteries that uses should be in just about every store by the way. like my local grocery store would have those at the cash register Ye I just seen on youtube CR1220. I'll wait to grt back home get a decent one. Only shops around me on vacation are these little tourist shops that charge you €15 euros for a kids bucket and spade...... If my charger has an option for 8 Amps, why does it cap on 2.2 V even if I put more than that That pic makes me nervous it should. they've basically created a fire hazard. lol Aaaa no worries, I just got it out for the photo, its all in a lipo safe bag :) :KEKw:. Like a LiPo bag will save you from *that* obscenity."
Have you got a lipo connected?. The vtx won’t power up unless it has a lipo to feed higher voltage into the 12v vtx regulators,"No. Anything liquid damaged is usually beyond repair. They're trying to get anything they can for the drone they crashed into water.  DO NOT.  Besides that, there are a multitude of better options than DJI crap. Yeah I know, I was just curious as there are very many broken drones if it even worth the try to offer them like 20€ And no, the DJI controller is crap, and not worth it's value as scrap electronics.  You can't use it with non DJI drones, for example. It's still worth 12€ for the props :KEKw: I have just cleaned the electronics with alcohol and washed the frame and all so idk what could be causing it or what even is happening"
"If you can sell said props, yeah. But why bother?  Terrible idea IMO.","I don't want to do business, I just was curious if it's worth attempting to try get them for very cheap, at least the motors can survive and the frame is still useable, even if you turn it into a frankendrone yes, it was plugged in, but still doesn't work I think I came up with a good argument. I tell the people that the only thing that's working on their drones is the frame and frames aren't that expensive, let's see if they understand. Whyyyyyyy, i didnt do anything whats going onn That's not a hazard thats house fire prep all he needs to do is strike a match and he's got a long lasting bonfire."
Guys how do I know which uart is it RX TX ??,"So I had a random vtx cutout and unfortunately crashed, leaving this dent on the end of one of my homemade li ion packs. Is this dangerous or is it probably fine. It's a big 21700 molicell 4200mah if that's important slap some silicone on there Yeah the voltages are fine so cross my fingers and hope for the best I have an oculus quest 2 I know I can't use those for fpv. But when I get my goggles can the lenses also get sun burned Yes. Just dont expose them to direct sunlight and youll be fine Ok I figured it was the same"
"Hi, I'm buying my first drone as a PnP. In the VTX specs it says the antenna interface is MMCX, but in the *in the box* section there is a 5.8G SMA FPV Antenna. It doesn't seem there is a MMCX-to-SMA pigtail in what's included. Am I missing something?",anyone suggest any backpacks or slings that can carry goggles whoop controller and accessories. preferably with plenty of pockets yo. i need some help. im getting zero flight time on all my batteries. i have 5 batteries. 3 cnhl. 4s 1550. and 2 GNB. also 4s 1550. the GNBs i got yesterday
Well zero flight time is pretty close to none. Is that a hole in the actual casing?,"that isn't even soldered.... this is why you use a spot welder... it is soldered. but its a large cell no that is practically glued so the solder doesnt cover the whole thing. umm. idk what to tell you it isnt. a spot welder is like 80 bucks and im only making a few of these Dose mAh matter, like can I use a higher mAh battery for flight time. Like will a 6S 1300 mAh be the same as 6s 3000mAh battery Yes. But at some point the extra weight will lead to lower flight time. And you will definitely feel it Is it bad for the motors to  fly longer then the max flight time Like would they over heat or something"
What would they get got from?,"From flying longer then normal Sounds like that emax freestyle has a risky tune on it that might cook the motors soon. Its not normal for motors to get hot in flight. Warm is ok, hot is not No, that has no effect on its own. The extra weight can cause issues by multiple ways"
what are the necessities for building ur own fpv drone?. and does anyone suggest any backpacks,"soldering iron, wires, screwdrivers. that's about it"
"Parts, tools, or knowledge?","knowledge mb i should’ve specified Know what each part does, and how the setup process works. We can help you with specific part selection but it's also a good idea to look at builds you like and get an idea of the necessary specs watch a few joshua bardwell build and setup videos and youll be good on the building part i’ve been looking but i wasn’t sure where to start"
do you suggest any builds for a 85mm?,i don't think a joshua video will help with a tinywhoop yeah. depends on what you want to do with it
"Hello , do you know guys connector what will survive 150A cont. discharge (72v) ?","start with picking a frame, then motors, then aio and then the rest will come itself"
something like an XT150 or something similar?,"if you're flying only outside which I assume from the 85mm, you'll probably get a carbon frame without prop guards But like 2 wires in 1 connector i have a mobula 8 should i just take off the prop guards yeah! just transfer that to a propguard-less frame. it'll fly lots better"
"also do you know what cable would survive 150A cont. 200A peak , 72v ?",prop guards are bad for flight performance and only really exist to protect surroundings and people does it impact how stable it is or anything cause sometimes when i bump into walls or smth it’s helpful that it wouldn’t stop the propeller and crash you can calculate this online. usually you'll just... bounce off Don't fly an open prop drone indoors alright do you know any specific frames Btw rn checked and Xt150 won't survive 150A cont i wasn’t. just had walls nearby that i was flying around
the props wouldn’t get stopped?,"Yeah but only for a very short time, then bf stabilizes it again"
Where can I get Conformal coating to waterproof my drone? I live in The Netherlands. Sillicone conformal coating right?,Mg Chemicals 422c. Search your local version of scamazon worst case.
"@s109apache  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhmtF44OH4 here is a video on how to flash it, well at 3:04 or so. but theres very qualified people here who can help u with it",Ok I’ll watch it but I have to figure out what da fuk is wrong with my drone now
are dji goggles compatible with analog?,some are. with some adaptors
Do I need to put in the optional screws in the back for the 03?,how much do adaptors cost an adapter alone like $20-50. an analog video receiver $20-200 on top of that are there any goggles i can use for both analog and he. hd not with DJI. you need DJI goggles to work with DJI VTXs doesn’t have to be dji. i’ve been looking at second hand goggles but i wasn’t sure which ones i should get as a upgrade
"quick question. when you change stuff through betaflight osd, do you connect the battery to your quad and then the usb, or just run it off the usb?","I just plug it in with usb, change osd settings, connect lipo to test How would you orient this rotate stack 180 degrees so that you can easily mount the capacitor"
How do I mount the 03?,"see im trying to get to this to change the power. but i got no idea how shi Idk man,I just use the beta flight configurator shit how you even do that man u open the google chrome. and uh type ""betaflight configurator"". and then click on betaflight configurator. connect usb to fc and pc. boom just used this instead. now the thing is fucking. 200mw vtx power it look shaky as fuck 25mw is fine. 200mw. shaky as all hell. whats up with it like. image is shaking. vibrating even oh shi. check your connections could it be like. cause we're in the same room it might be because you're too close. yea was gonna say had some breakup. but if i think about it gotta make it a long distance type thing. like edating. but with your VTX so like. out in the field. shit'll be nice bigger range and all that inside, more suited to that 25mw shit. cause E=hf that's wassup. hell yea if we replace e with power u get p=hf. booming business oh shi. yea I don't have phycics yet. soon bro i'm doing electrical engineering i should know this shit Shi I study mechatronics engineeniring. 2nd year dawg. we kinda enemies then. ain't we 2nd year electrical engineering also bro. in a way, yes in another way, we could be lovers man. no homo end of last year we were finishing up w 3 phase you know, now it's all about that flux density and shit ah shi. I'm just learning how to design and test shit now. control tech so i think. i dont know man Trying to figure out. because the frequency always will be 5860mhz. but we are trying to push more power at this same frequency yea. I mean u could change the f fatshark goggle only go up to 5860 u could go down. shi that's gay would that make a difference though. lower freq lower freq means longer range. better penetration. but maybe illigal so check your laws and shi nah fuck that man i'll go low as fuck lets see. 200mw at. 2740 you'll cause problems with uh. 2.4 ghz ofcom is useless  as fuck bro shi Idk even know ofcom I transmit on 465.800 with no license no one bothers you. or 463.835 wild. I guess if u use low power output you're aight Just wait till they find out we can listen to air traffic control with a UV5K shi. Idk what that is either. brother I am mechatronics Little handheld radio, shit without new firmware but eh alright if you're near the airport with the egzumer firmware should see the ones we have at work, one radio costs like £800 They're wild as fuck though you can talk to ATC on airband and shit like that. 118.705 brother. I don't need all that. I just fly. I am bird thats what they all say man shi. maybe 'cuz we in drone discord for sure man for sure what drone setup u rollin Man i got that standard emax tinyhawk 2 freestyle right now. gonna get me a new VTX unless this 200mw solves the range issue"
"otherwise, happymodel ep1 for my radiomaster boxer when it decides to arrive. how about yourself?","I'm just waiting on my motors to arrive. got a 5 inch shiiiit what build. how much did it cost I made it. it's my girl man. like uh. around 250. for the quad includign a pack. euros i need to pull some OT bro what's OT. idk these terms man actually shit i think i did 100 or so hours ot last month. overtime I'm like, movie star planet staying back. work shit ah yes. overtime. we like overtime. I don't like overtime Last month i had a week where i did a 17.5 hour, 16 hour, and a 15 hour 3 days in a row bro. that's not nice man. I like my freetime It ain't nice but it pays when you work minimum wage and you got family to feed you need it man"
"I for few hours a week, it pays my drone setup. true, u got kids?",shi. thought u was like 18

u talking kids?. like don't trust one kid make two kids. ?,"ah yea. u can abortion not as double condoms. but like use different methods of protection That is your child man, best to prevent in the first place I didn't think that way the first time and now that my son is here, you will know how it feels when you have your own funny how we talking kids and condoms in a quick help drone channel. I bet brother It's quick questions and helping,  for other things in life but still a help I am on late shifts this week, thank fuck man. Early morning rush is crazy, one team doing 3 things its mental that's rough. I start at 7 sometimes. prolly makes u laugh. but ay 7 is alright, from around 7 all the early shit is out. that 0500 start hits hard though up at 0400 leave like, 0430. then get fucked all day because too many planes not enough people. end up loading the hold on your own :skull: haha. that's how it goes man. sometimes you're on your own. when you depended on your team. it's life man. deep shit Too right man. let me tell you, couple days ago. I was with john mills, no one calls him john by the way always just, john mills. anyway the guy leaves 0 gap when loading, you have to be superhuman or some shit to deal with him. so anyway, we get to loading, 3 man team, first 2 jet2s like 300 bags, get to like, half 6 in the morning. man the suns coming up, cold as fuck, feels like -5. he comes out, 3 coffees in hand, shit i dont think there  has ever been a better feeling than that shi man. I bet bro. never done shi like that man i tell you, get into it for a bit, even over the winter. ground crew is the most fun work i ever did, period"

Yeah minimum wage is shit. untillll you drive and headset. then pushback. it goes to quite high. and less workload"
what you do for working?,"I stock the shelfs. and work cashier. in store That's alright job you know yea man. it's above the min wage If you ever looking for something easy as fuck and decent money.

we would never know. you ever felt like you were going to die?. Truly?,"Not in an adrenaline way. but in a pain way pain way is wierd. eventually the pain becomes a background thing. you only think of what you have done. you can actually feel losing control of your bowels as well it goes more dim in a way. but i guess if death was to happen it would just get dimmer instead of come back obviously. but that is the feeling. amplified thought, while the rest of your body doesnt feel much it's all in the head man. most of the things ain't even real. in times of pain"
is tryp fpv good physics wise? it’s graphics looks amazing,"havent tried it but not that i have heard it looks like a new simulator i think its been around for a few years, got a big update like a bit ago (maybe half a year) ic i’ve never heard of it before it got released in 2022. so just 2 years yeah not too long ago. ic ic what does ic mean. lol or alternatively. https://tenor.com/view/icee-cold-drink-drinks-cold-drinks-gif-1128220687606373753 yummy. this might be dumb but i’ve never thought about it, why do most drones have no cooling system yeha that’s what i thought. just didn’t think it could cool that much I mean most things don't need too much cooling. the MCU's don't tend to get hot enough to need cooling They got 4 fans on them :Harold:"
Thermal paste? On the stickers?,wtf is on those chips
I’m having trouble getting beta flight to recognize my SBUS reciever. I have the right UART enabled and the radio and reciever are paring. Anyone know what I’m doing wrong?,How long it takes to assemble a custom fpv drone for the first time. If you know what you're doing yes. To config the drone is a different story but again if you know what your doing less than a day.
But if its my first drone ?,"Eh i personally haven't built a drone from scratch just rebuilt prebuilts, but first build maybe takes a couple of hours or maybe roll over to the next day.. Work at your own pace and dont rush, if something isnt working stop and think instead of trial and error ok, thanks for helping *:D*"
oh really? when you say camera drone are you talking about the DJIs? We are very new to this... that's just the brand I keep seeing pop up everywhere so I'm not set on that... we absolutely want to be more focused on flying and less on footage,velocidrone plus the freestyle expansion is considered to have the best physics. liftoff is another option. also an fpv sim and a camera drone have basically nothing to do with each other. a camera drone basically flies itself
just clarifying - do you mean liftoff: FPV drone racing? do I just get the base game or is there a specific DLC I should get as well?,"""more focused on flying"" yeah you don't really want  a camera drone then. https://store.steampowered.com/app/410340/Liftoff_FPV_Drone_Racing/ great... looking at it now. dlc-wise, uhhh night fever is pretty cool slipstream seems like it would be, haven't tried it though thanks for the info :slightly_smiling_face: so yeah, get Liftoff and a radiomaster elrs transmitter id say thanks... I am reading up on the drones in the shopping list... this stuff is fascinating"
nevermind i just found out. why wont my drone arm?,if only we knew what  the white and yellow wires were connected to on the thing you are trying to solder
ive replaced the aio dtoday. what wires should i focus on?,"all, but mainly the motors. one short could mess it all up all elrs cables look connected too"
does it recieve signal?. u can test it in betaflight. at the recievers tab,my radio shows that its connected. video works too did u test it in reciever tab well test it. pookie bear
"depends, does your reciever get powerd when just usb powered?",aight than u good. so just plug it in and test at reciever tab. be sure that you have the right protocols selected it doesnt connect unless i have a battery aight. then use a batt
where does it show if its connected?,well the light usually shows static on the reciever. but that may depend on your rx your radio might show connection symbol well u can test it by going to the reciever tab and wiggle your throttle. see if it shows up
"well then that's why is doesn't arm, did u select the right revievers protocol?. for ELRS it's crsf. and serial via uart I think","good stuff, check your modes and then try to arm"
yea that's normal. does it trigger when hitting the switch?,"well in the modes tab. does it turn red when u hit the switch nice. try it in the real world tysm bro. i havent flied in like a month much love man. sounds like you've taken a long ass break haha. enjoy brother ty. its raining.... dang it. im gonna fly tommorow i guess oof, can always practise your throttle control by going in the living room :face_with_tears_of_joy: anyone got a clue what goggles these are thought so. i wanted to buy their whoops and batteries but they wanna sell the entire lot for 200 that's just a bunch of FPV junk, nothing of value"
whoops are of value no?,"its really hard to see what those whoops are, but I see brushed motors on one which is a big no no, then there's the old mobula 6 that has SPI frsky which is despair, and I imagine those other 2 are the same"

Can you change the VTX settings normally without the Pocket?,the leds apear to change brightness when u throtle or something. looks nice
the crux35 has the ovx303 right?. that only goes up to 300mW. oh but the table they provide also says 400. lovely,"Oh, matbe thats the issue what version of Betaflight are you on It keeps ob correcting me ```vtxtable bands 6 vtxtable channels 8 vtxtable band 1 BOSCAM_A A FACTORY 5865 5845 5825 5805 5785 5765 5745 5725 vtxtable band 2 BOSCAM_B B FACTORY 5733 5752 5771 5790 5809 5828 5847 5866 vtxtable band 3 BOSCAM_E E FACTORY 5705 5685 5665 0 5885 5905 0 0 vtxtable band 4 FATSHARK F FACTORY 5740 5760 5780 5800 5820 5840 5860 5880 vtxtable band 5 RACEBAND R FACTORY 5658 5695 5732 5769 5806 5843 5880 5917 vtxtable band 6 LOWRACE  L FACTORY 5333 5373 5413 5453 5493 5533 5573 5613 vtxtable powerlevels 5 vtxtable powervalues 1 2 14 20 26 vtxtable powerlabels 0 RCE 25 100 400 save```. put that in your cli"

"For the avata 2, do you need to have the motion controller to navigate the menu in the headset? or can you do everything with the rc3?",Idk man. would recommend for u to read the docs on the avata 2
"What are they for?. It seems like it changes channels more smoothly noe, but still goes right into pit mode. Even adds :face_with_tongue: after the vtx power to indicate pit mode",everything seems to be good. wait. the drone wants all the motors to be spinning clockwise Well that’s not right
what do i need to show?,"motors tab in Betaflight Idk bout your clock, but that ain't all clockwise press ""motor direction is reversed"" and save. then make sure all your props are going the way it shows. same for the motors"
How in the world could the motors spin a different direction then the props? They're directly conected,"reading comprehension they are still spinning clockwise. all of them product listing mostly lol. but we can just try. close Betaflight open up <https://esc-configurator.com/> in a chromium browser, plug in a battery along with your usb, press connect, press read settings bottom right"
yeah. what now. maybe ive just soldered the motors incorrectly?,"the wiring for motors don't matter too much, they usually don't even have markings on the wires, just wire them all in the same order I think on the right you can reverse them. the motors. direction: whatever. and then you press write settings"
reverse all of them or only the ones that arent spinning correctly?,only the ones that are spinning the wrong way
did it. what now?. do i test it or what?,in the esc-configurator you can also update firmware and set your startup tune. like... music-tune will they spin correctly when rolling etc. ik if it can hover it can do everything else
so it will yaw correctly?. like. all outputs will behave normally?,i mean they should. they spin the right way. the props are on the right way. if something else is wrong it's for a different reason
and. why do you think the motors were spinning clockwise no matter what?. even when enabling reverse prop?,"reverse prop only informs betaflight what way they are spinning. it doesn't actually change anything, it just informs them spinning clockwise is simply how they were soldered, happens on every build it changes which motors betaflight spins up and spins down when yawing i think that everythings finally set up"
so did you not do what I told you to do?.... this is what you're supposed to have pasted into the CLI. yet that very much looks like you haven't,"I pasted the entire thing You asked. Apart from the power values but he wont take numbers like 14, 20 not the entire thing. if you sent the entire thing, it would also send the save command"
also. that is not at all what I sent???. like literally what is in that screenshot that you claimed is copied from me is not at all what I sent to you. hello???,"I sent a screenshot of whats already saved in there, i did save them"
"What makes You say that?. I cant give you a screenshot of the entire thing cuz once i pste it it reboots betaflight, but i did it already a couple times, its just that i need to change the power values then cuz cli wont take them","I don't know what to tell you, you just straight up have not copied what I sent you into the CLI. which is all you were asked to do.... this entire block of text I did, the entire block. if you copy that and paste it, it should save and reboot, that's expected Yup, thats what happened but Emily keeps saying i didnt, even though I did. Okay i just figured it out. It was the rce that kept messing everything up. Going from top through 400, 100, 25 snd up was fine, but once it hit rce it was stuck in pit mode. Thanks for the help, i dont know what i did to offend you emily but that was not my intention RCE means that it's in pit mode until you arm it Yea, but arming didnt really change anything. But it might have been something else back then in the park, i did change a lot in the meantime trying to figure it out. Well, real happy i figured it out. Thanks for help! :slightly_smiling_face: What was the conclusion on the air65. I kinda forgot about it completely Really good if you're flying alone.

what would be a ideal whoop (or general race drone) for a official race?,one built exactly to the spec of the air65 but with the 5in1 AIO also how do i setup this
okay??. ig that is helpful. do you know of any exact builds? tho,"the air65 is pretty much perfect, but the 4in1 AIO has an issue with the VTX being too high on the output power oh. is the air 75 ok for racing or is the 65 better okay. I wonder if the ymzfpv lightning2 would be a option. for racing that is"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet). a little help?,"you probably wouldn't be allowed to race that in a whoop race nop, no guards, not a whoop. also props too big"

"Without the 4G part, a Mini 2 should run you about 300 USD and make that flight time. Any particular reason you want a cell signal?","Just wanted to know the rough budget I should have for a 4G drone with ~30 minutes of flight time & camera mostly the range, and DIY cause of the price. might be wrong tho"
"yes, my original plan was just to use a dongle w/ raspberry pi, but im clueless about motors, are those examples public with part list?","Alright, I'll admit it, by pretty few I know of 0. If you just want motors on a platform, you may be interested in long range FPV builds. Around the size of 4""-5"" propellers"
"what do you mean ""if you want motors on a platform"", what would move the propellers then?. those have to be on every drone as im aware","Ah, my mistake. Usually when people pursue their own camera drone builds they want to be able to build the stabilizing gimbal as well, and I mean I don't know of those projects. However, FPV drones have the hardware necessary for basic long range flying already my imagination of the project is very simple, i want somebody to prove me wrong before i order some parts. that's smart"
Has anyone bought the new radiomaster pocket crush? I just ordered it it's getting here by the end of the month. So what I'm trying to ask is is there any difference betweeen the see-through on and the crush version,"quick question [2:25 AM] my stupid friend pluged a 1200mw vista and put its antennas close to my tbs fusion receiver and all my screen went black [2:25 AM] will it damage my vrx tbs fusion [2:27 AM] i turned off and power the googles back but wasnt able to test if it has the same performance bcs its was a new place and i was out of lipos [2:28 AM] pls send help im freaking stressed [6:42 PM] it's fine [6:42 PM] it shouldn't get overloaded or damaged [6:43 PM] it's a good VRX [6:43 PM] tell your friend to stand further away next time, 3 meters minimum"
Are you posting in every single channel you see people talking?,"Me. Na I keep posting stuff in the wrong threads im tryna find help guys. thx but im still worried bcs i just bought it with my last money im broke There is no difference, just colors maybe don't do that then my stupid friend did it i wasnt seeing him do that i was flying he did it without permission"
Is there a way to save VTX power per vtx on walksnail? Whenever I set VTX power in goggles its annoying that it then uses that for all drones. Eg I want one drone to be 25mw but another to stay at 500mw,probably not at this time. never heard of such a feature. although I *was* under the impression it was per-vtx it would make sense to be haha. ah well its not the biggest hassle
Recommended? It's a paid app. Ok,"except for skydive theres no proper ones. and skydive is also kinda terrible Velocidrone has an android version. Not sure how good it is though I have the desktop version. The physics are the best available in a drone sim atm. I don't have a gaming pc. Actually no pc. Just laptops for running regular office apps and browser. So I don't think purchasing the pc version will be worth it Might be worth a punt, both the desktop and android versions are cheap, for what this hobby costs."
"Hi, I'm trying to build a custom drone from scratch, for educational purposes. I'll be writing my own firmware, just wondering how large should my flash size and ram size of my flight controller MCU be? I get that it will depend on the firmware's complexity, but what's the usual range? and recommended size?","It can be done on an Arduino, ie Atmel MCU. But STM32 MCUs are most commonly used with ESP32 used sparingly. Programming a whole flight controller firmware is very hard, that's a long project"
"Yea I'll see how long I can keep myself motivated haha, I'm looking into STM32 MCUs, is 256 kB enough for the flash size?","Depends on what you make. Betaflight requires 512kB. But it's a fairly advanced firmware Hmm ok, that gives me a clearer picture, maybe I'll get a 512 kB, run something simple and get something working, gives me space to expand in the future, thanks"
can i switch from acro to angle mid flight when my drone is upside down and my max arming angle is set to 90°?,"You should be able to *I am not liable in case you try switching from acro to angle in mid flight when your drone is 180° and crash and break your drone if it makes any difference I have my controller set up to have horizon as a failsafe, but I’ve not used it yet. It’s a weird setup… but it works"
m is there any way i can check if the onboard vtx is off?. cuz current setup is crux3 1s with ws mini kit. also the vtx is on 38.43.4 and the goggles are on 38.43.7 but .7 is not out yet,"I believe you can control output power with a switch on your radio, but that's the only option from your list of ideas that's possible If the vtx is off... You won't see anything in the goggles... nah the onboard analog vtx You cannot turn it off can i check for sure cuz i had to desolder some pads, but i dunno if i have done it correctly Same as for any vtx. If it's off, there will be no transmission."

you can't go outside or?,"WOAH if you are on BF 4.5 i would change that. i could be wrong. but i believe they changed the way horizon works. if your quad is all the way upside down and you flip to horizon with your sticks centered, it will not flip to the correct orientation afaik. double check but i think i heard bardwell mention that having anything but ""drop to the ground"" as failsafe is stupid yes. i would make your arm angle 180 if i were you but yeah that will work. unless you have gps rescue. i have angle included in my gps rescue failsafe. otherwise i agree gps rescue is only useful for long range its only *not useful* if youre under something. disregarding whoop ofc. if my 5"" was on frsky (its not) and i failsafed on the otherside of my house or some dumb shit it would save me"

"I saw the command that says the tx12 is a cheap race grade radio.. What makes something a race grade radio?  Like, specs it needs. ???. Is there a standard definition of race radio?",I don't think it means anything anymore now that any half decent radio is good enough to race with
"So any tx is a race tx?. I mean, I guess technically so. I was curious if the community actually had  a definition.. Like with race drones. If it's fpv, it's basically racable.. Most fpv drones work in races. I would think something like my touch screen ags 101 tx16s would qualify (the gimbals were more than the ENTIRE tx12). I looked up the tx12. Good lord am I thankful I can afford better :folded_hands: :folded_hands::folded_hands:",The sticks on the RM pocket remind me of its cost :Harold:
Now I wish my tango 2 still worked.  But a pocket would be a decent compromise for travel.. Are the sticks more like a Playstation controller or something?,"Less travel, ergo lower resolution, harder to be precise.. Works well for some though, I ain't badmouthing the thing. They sell mini AG01s for it, so can't be that bad. Oh interesting. Yea, that would be a good compromise for travel.. I'm not bringing my tx16s with me to Europe Perfect for travel. That and a little overpowered 2.5"" whoop. Bosh.. Still needs LiPos, charger and goggles though :grimacing_face:. 650mAh LiPos are easy enough in carry-on luggage though.

is it just a personal opinion or what?,ye 1 moment. test sheet for new motors or current ones
are antenna adapters ok to use?. Like SMA to UFL?,"Do not quote me on this, but I think you loose some dbm doing this. Not much but you will loose a bit. pretty much but some adapters are better than others. using a pigtail is fine especially for what we're doing i was thinking as almost all foxeer are SMA but the rush mini tank is UFL"
im assuming you have horizon as a failsafe so the quad automatically rights itself? right? horizon wont do that if youre upside down all the way iirc. which was changed in 4.5. iirc,"The Rush Tank Mini is MMCX shit sorry the rush tiny tank foxeer should have a bunch of ufl antennas Well, idk… it doesn’t matter too much"
"is it for gps rescue or what. if its for gps rescue its important. if not, failsafe should drop right?","I fly tinywhoops. Its gonna crash before it can right itself anyways set it to drop then dummy :Harold: That’s what the disarm does. I rather have it incase I bump into something, instead of instinctively disarming, I can flip to horizon or angle oh you dont mean literally a part of your betaflight failsafe tab. you just have it on a switch for you to hit. i thought you meant it was in stage one reciever failsafe, which could be a disaster on a 5"". what you have is fine lmao i use a 3pos arm switch with angle. although i just drop my whoop when i hit something"
oh man :face_with_tears_of_joy:. ive been literally holding my quads when i calibrate them. does my quad sit flat? is my table flat? *is my floor flat?*. the answer is i dont care,"i wonder if you could add accellerometer trim somewhere. i may be confusing that with pitch and roll trim, which you do not want. and i also dont think you want to change the board alignment. you could try calibrating it while the drone is actually offset in the wrong direction opposite the drift. but otherwise its probably just not gonna be perfect. none of my quads really hover perfectly in angle fuck it.. ill have to master flying indoors with acro -_-. really annoying -_-. The board alignment is good i am certain of that. One of the first things I checked with betafpv. i always run acro on whoops indoors, but larger quads are a lot tougher lol not hell yeah be nice if shit worked ^_^ do you always fly that quad in angle or do you switch between angle and acro. you could technically add trim to the radio. not usually a great idea. but i think it would work the purpose of those quad is to do indoor stuff. However I recently came back from holiday and took it with me just to try ripping it. So I got to fly it on both acro and angle it will not work with acro. you would need two models on your radio one for acro and one for angle. honestly i dont have much issue just compensating for it using the sticks but if i really wanted it perfect i would try that. cant hurt ye ill play around with trim and if that resolves it, create a seperate radio profile for that. im running some ancient opentx firmware but its still nice to be able to copy and move around profiles on a pc instead of doing it on the radio lol Gonna try one last time. But getting out the big tools now!! Well I think I swe what the issue is.. Drone is facing correct direction..... but yaw is at 46..... And not close to 0"
will i need to do anything to fly 2 drones at the same time with 2 separate radios?. i know how to change video frequency but idk if 2 elrs 2.4 signals wont collide with eachother,"ELRS, like every modern control link, is a spread spectrum protocol, so the frequency is changed many times per second to avoid conflicting. you can have dozens of aircraft up at the same time, as evidenced by Flite Test's combat events"

"The power adapter that came with this iMax B6 charger died, so I hooked it up with a computer power supply that claims 34A max on 12v. If I charge my 6S 100C 1200mAh battery at any current more than 1.2A, the charger shows ""INPUT VOLTAGE ERROR"" on the display. Never used to happen with the previous cheap ass 5A 12v adapter. Any thoughts?. There shouldn't be any issues for this Cooler Master 450W to give 12v at 5A or so.","The issue could be that the old powersupply provided 12.3V and the coolermaster now provides 12.1V which drops a bit when current flows and that's just not enough for your charger. Could be, I measured the computer power supply's open ended voltage, it was 12.22V Generally, i don't trust these 20$ amazon chargers anyway. You shouldn't cheap out on something that might set your house on fire. but it may be dropping under load. Yeah I know. I always charge it under my supervision. I'll never leave it unattended I don't think you can adjust the output voltage of your powersupply. So you might try to open up your charger and look for a potentiometer to increase the low voltage limit. Otherwise, time to get a good charger Sounds risky, given that it is a cheap charger. May be I'll get a better one Try taking power from a PCIe or EPS connector (molex could work too). not from the 24pin. BUT. that charger is the MOST WELL KNOWN FIRE HAZARD in this entire hobby @Sunil Does the Phantom 4 support manual flight mode. Like all sensors off acro Yes, will try this. Thanks <--  scratching my head thinking ""what the hell just happen"". let me explain. I have a 2"" and a 5"" drone. I use radiomaster boxer. I was flying my 2"" when I looked down at my radio and realized it was actually on my 5"" drone.. How was I able to fly my 2 while in my 5. what the heck why do people even have different radio setups for their different quads"
you mean different model? @Forbidden2know,all that does is change the switch layouts (if theyre even different at all)
Do you have model match enabled? @Forbidden2know,"but the pids for a 2"" is different from my 5"". so how was that possible the pids are saved on your FC That's just not related to the radio at all unless youre using a different switch layout for some reason its kinda useless to have different models for every quad you have ok, I will check to see if I have the model match on.... I didn't think I did. but I will check"
Do you use ELRS? Just checking. you said boxer so I assumed. @Forbidden2know,"In a  model you have a value called Receiver Number (aka RX Num). ELRS always stores its settings (power level, packet rate, etc) based on Receiver number.. sorry for the edits xD brain too fast. By default, Receiver number in a new model is 0, but you can change it. Then there is a function in ELRS called Model Match I have AVATAR HD goggles, but unsure just how far to twist those 4 antennas down, Im so new. On a receiver, you can set the Model match number (Receiver number).  This will cause the receiver to only accept inputs from a transmitter if its radio is currently using a model with the same Receiver number (and model match is enabled on the transmitter). With this you can prevent the usage of the wrong model. Documentation:  <https://www.expresslrs.org/software/model-config-match/> Thank you. I'm gonna have to get me a cup of coffee, take a break  and soak in everything you said,  because strange things is happening that's never happen before with my drone.    ( of course I'm learning so no telling what I've done inside Betaflight...lol Don't crank on them. Just screw them on until they stop turning with light finger pressure."
"anyone?. eh I don't agree with that, you should always be near your lipos during charging anyways, why spend alot on something that does the same","it's a charger that's very well known for exploding itself or the batteries... you just gotta treat her right man. even the most expensive equipment can blow stuff up if u use her wrong the treatment doesn't matter, it's designed to blow. yep. I just wrote that. the realisation set in 10s after I pressed enter"
my guy. :face_with_tears_of_joy:. we talking chargers right?,"the B6 and B6AC have a couple significant flaws.  The biggest issue is the simple fact that it overheats massively.. The saddest fact is that the shitty knockoffs (of the original B6, which doesn't really exist nowadays) which made one small adjustment - addition of a fan - don't blow up anywhere near as often. haha. mine worked fine so far use her as a hand warmer during the winter when it starts to take longer and longer to finish charging. in the last part of charging That's the primary symptom of it going boom soon. FFFFFFFFFFFF. I should not write anything today Not persee, if u balance charge, which u should, it takes longer because of it's slow ass balance rate you don't understand. 1) you should always balance charge. 2) it's the balance circuitry which blows. it deteriorates, making the balancing take longer and longer eventually, one of a couple different things fail sometimes it's the cell voltage measurement circuitry, so it keeps reading a cell as 4.1V and overcharges that cell or the entire battery til it blows because of faulty logic  other times the circuitry pops and shorts to ground ah well, I think she atleast looks cute. the charger"
I had a B6AC *can you guess why that's past tense?*,"she went a lil bit too hard on cell #1. like 4.5V hard not great, but it shouldn't blow yeah I caught it as the battery was turning into a balloon. maximus yeetus. the fun part is that the charger still kept showing 4.1V. meanwhile, cell checker was like OH HELL NAW. yeah so both the battery and the charger went bye bye"
do u think btw FPV.skydive the basic quad is a 4s or 6s?,"anyway, over the many years I've seen MANY instances of this general issue.  Same inital symptom every time.  Balancing takes longer and longer, regardless of battery size.. Meanwhile, my turnigy dual B6 clone lives to this day. guess what. IT HAS A FAN. https://tenor.com/view/no-idea-idk-i-dunno-i-dont-know-no-clue-gif-5178996. it's not like it matters that much nowadays anyway SAME. EH i GUES. shit capslock. my bad homie AAAH SHOUTING ON THE INTERNET. np bru. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Option A) Get a cheap pair of analog goggles for people to ride-along with. Experience: Ok Option 2: get a USB OTG fpv receiver to plug into your phone. Experience: bleh Choice iii-- HDZero goggles with expansion bay for wifi streaming: Experience: Ok (good video quality with a lot of lag) Fun note:  the fan falls off if you hit it hard enough Possibility B.3.yyyy:  Get a good video receiver module and an analog capture card with composite input. and jank together a receiver assembly yea. my goggles have a video OUTPUT port. I think. so I could use that"
"If you calibrate the stick trim (so whilst drone is on but not armed, you throttle up and then move the right stick in the direction you are trying to correct). Is that permanent correction or does that stick trim correction reset with each power cycle?",my B6 had a fan. it does not anymore the original B6's definitely don't have a fan xD
Anyone got any tips to get clean solders?. like a good temp to use,"good equipment, good materials, good technique I just blast it at max temp and wipe it off with a sponge Alright, my solders are good enough to work but not very pretty at all"
what equipment do you use?,"Can always redo it and make it perfect. Better practice that way. Honestly Most of the stuff I have is old. My soldering iron is one from amazon, heats up and works really well, I have flux, sponge, arms to hold stuff, tweezers, desoldeing pump thingy, desoldering copper wire.. and my solder is old as hell, it says Sn 60, Pb 40, flux 2.0%. Yea I do want to tbh if you can't name the iron, it probably sucks"
what would be the downside? Like what would I get out of an expensive one?,you don't need an expensive one. a Pinecil V2 costs like 25 bucks
yea sorry I meant like a branded one. bc the one i have heats up real quick an has no issue soldering anything. the only issue I have is when i take the iron off the solder follows the iron and leaves a spike. Is that just bad technique or the iron?,"that's generally caused by a lack of heat or lack of flux like I want a nice circle. aaaah alright I dont use flux all the time so thats probably why As for good solder, you want real actual 63/37. 60/40 is alright, but 63/37 is better. alright ill get that as i have almost used all of this one. its like 30 years old :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: I had some ancient soviet era solder. which was surprisingly great. but smelled like it caused cancer to the whole neighborhood. then I got TBS Solder and that smells even worse. but solders even better :KEKw: I use a cheap Amazon station it works great. I've had alot of cheap irons suck though. Mostly the tips all were crap Yeah that feeling when the tip of the iron becomes part of the solder joint @LoopyAnh im going to get some smelly ass solder now lmao like, for getting reliably good solder, TBS solder has been great. There are other companies which sell stuff from the same OEM though.. Think RDQ or GetFPV... one of them I'm considering buying a big spool of good quality solder and sell 100g bits of it for profit. :KEKw: LOL you probably would profit, a lot. it's the classic thing Buy 20L of water Sell 40x 0.5L of water profit I'm convinced that cheap irons can be good but it's very much a luck of the draw. Hoping you got the better quality iron. Obviously getting a decent quality one would be better I used a cheap iron with stock tips for a good while, I would say that my first quad had solder joints made with 10% soldering iron tip alloy. yes the tip itself would melt I got a TS100 back in the day when it was still a new thing :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. The screen on it is mostly dead nowadays xD. I should get a pinecil... $25 for a Pine64 Pinecil V2 is more than enough. it's a great iron yea I do one one I can take out If you do actual research you pretty much always come to the Pinecil and the other TS100-clones"
"idk, did you check the voltage after the flight ?","so on 1s my voltage in the osd was fine. on 2s the voltage is all like LAND NOW, 2.5V, LAND NOW. why would that be. @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) well, if you used a 1s and told it it's a 2s it will freak out thinking it's half the voltage per cell it really is, and if you plug in a 2s and it says it's a 2s at  2.5v per cell, you might just have overdischarged your batteries na the batteries were fine it said 2.5v as soon as i started flying and i flew for 5 min yeah they were 3.7 or so. the fc was straight up wrong. they were 4.3 when i plugged the quad in and the quad was like LAND NOW well, in the battery tab, tell it  the maximum voltage for each cell is 4.4 or 4,5v, try again, if it's still off, then you can go calibrate the voltage and have both battery voltage and cell voltage. so you know if it's going crazy because it thinks you are flying a 3s or if it's because the voltage readout is wrong"
"anybody have recommendations on how to not be so shit at flying indoors with tiny whoops? I have a 75 mm, and i can like dash from one end of the house to the other, and i can go really slow and careful, but i dont feel like i have that much control over it, but if i go fly in the sims (liftoff micro) i feel like i can do so much more","https://oscarliang.com/best-tinywhoop-settings/ make sure your settings are setup right.  Motor idle, rates, throttle scale, etc  otherwise just practice You can always play with your rates, but if you change them constantly youll never get good at one specific set of rates. It's really just a ton of practice i think"
any recommendations for practicing in the sim?. dont rly wanna kill my tiny whoop. i also do think the main issue for me is i need to find what rates i like. i was doign actual rates 150 center 660 max with an expo of .6. but tht was for my 2s whoop and 4s flywoo explorer. should rates be the same on all ur drones?,"you grab the radio and launch the sim. depends on you, some people have different rates on all  their quads, others have only one set of rates (personnally I just use whatever the standard betaflight rates are in quicksilver and I just go fly, they work well for me)"
"Okay so what about the frame i chose, can it be configured to inav if i wanted, is i nav still flown with goggles or more controller/display screen ?","the frame has nothing to do with INAV. it's some pieces of metal and carbon fiber. the most it would have to do with your FC software is not having terrible resonance characteristics that mess with thr gyro filtering. INAV can be flown fpv just fine. it's worse for quick maneuvering, betaflight is more optimized for that. just get a transmitter first (I recommend the Radiomaster Boxer or Boxer Crush, or Jumper T20 or T15) I dont understand reasoning behind getting a controller first, its like your doubting my ability to be able to fly a fpv drone lol, im eager to build, i would have definitely tested a simulator along the ride of building before my first flight, i want to build one I wouldn't say starting with a 5"" would be the best, usually people get a whoop first, then I'd say a 3""-3.5"". I am doubting your ability, it's quite hard.. but worth it of course. anyway, I don't know much about frames but I think the QAV should work fine. you might be able to find a frame on cncdrones as well. building is quite fun, I made this: Very nice! Im just going to take my time researching and i build and order parts slowly. Just want to order that frame that way im locked into the hobby and follow through with a complete build, if i get the frame i cant turn back ! Lol"
"Hello! i just want to clear things up before i order a paralell charging board. As of now i use my charger to charge my 4pcs of 3S 550mah LIHV packs before flying, and it takes around 30-35 min to charge from storage voltage to full per pack at 1C (0.6Amps). Was thinking about starting to parallel charge to get that wait time down from 2 hours to just 30-35min, if i havent misunderstood anything its completely fine to use a parallel charging board to charge 4pcs of these packs  using 4C (2.2Amps) so long i make sure the batteries are all charged up to the same storage charge beforehand?","Yes, that would be fine. You would still be charging at 1C though. As you increase the capacity by plugging them in parallel, you will increase your amperage without increasing your C-rate. Please get a balance board with (replaceable) fuses. Preferably one that has fuses for the balance connections as well. HGLRC Thor series would fit these requirements. Thats the one im looking for ^^ I would go for the 6 battery version, in case you upgrade to more batteries in the future. yeah might do, starting to think 20 min flight time is quite low ^^. Or maybee will wait and see if BETAfpv is going to start selling their LAVA batteries in a 650mAh version, they have it as a recommendation on the drone page but dont sell more than 550"
"Definitely a center mark and a drill. Oh lord, dip switches? How old is your receiver?. I mean the HD2 are old anyway",A cutting tool. Or Possibly a drilling tool ive got some dominators hd2 but i cant seem to find the analog channel the rx is in it but idk how to change to the analog when i change the channels its only going to av and hdmi  ( **GOT IT WORKING CHANGE YOUR RECIEVER DIP SWITCHES** )
"nice, do i need to get a different fc or can i use the same fc esc stack as a quad?","I mean, you *could*, but it’s a linear antenna, not circularly polarized"
"I wouldn’t expect it to be, especially since I would guess that the antennas on your goggles/VRX are also circularly polarized. What issue are you experiencing that is driving you to replace the stock antennas?","im using the goggles L. range. ig 120 m max on 350mw but also im not keeping my head pointed im facing down cuz they heavy as shit A chin-Chester. Those built-in directional antennas aren’t going to receive anything from the Earth’s mantle nah if i try to bring my head up i cant breathe cuz they block my nose. what antena would be good for the ws mini kit In that case yes, it’s possible that the Microvee would do better because the Goggles L’s built-in omnis are linear"
that is reasonably priced?. goggles L has omnis?,"Although, *stupidly* the GL’s omnis aren’t oriented 90 to each other It has two built-in patch directional and two built-in linear omnis. See the breakdown from MadsTech"
"huuuuuh it has 4 antenas?""??. my life is a lie","It’s worth noting that the Goggles L aren’t really meant for long range, but I would definitely have expected more than 120m from  them"
neither is my 720mah battery. are there any bigger 1s?,"They say up to 400m, but I guess that's in ideal conditions"
so i should try using the MicroVee antena?,"I’d try pointing your head first tbh, at least once even though it’s uncomfortable. But yea you could try that antenna. Or just a ufl whip antenna. Also worth noting that, again, the linear Omnis in the GL are not oriented 90 degrees to each other, so you don’t have null coverage or cross-polarization coverage in the goggles. If your VTX antenna is 90 degrees to those antennas, you will see a bunch of gain loss idk they aint mine friend just bought a whoop and flies digital mainly these was for his long range plane it is pointing straight up. like the WS logo is vertical The antennas in the goggles l point out to the sides"
ah. but uh is there a bigger 1s than 720?,Yeah I don't think there are really any bigger than that. They certainly don't go up to 1000
"Throttle stick movements feels wavy/rough on stock Radiomaster Boxer gimbals. The radio is fine and other sticks (yaw, pitch, roll is ok). I noticed this today. What does this mean and what can I do about it to fix?",i can only find 60c cells
"That should be fine. Feels in what way? Like physically in your fingers, or are you seeing it in the movement of your aircraft?","Might need to loosen it I noticed it yesterday, it was fine before that Possible that some dust got in the mechanism, you could blow it out with some compressed air"
"what on earth are these 2 things on the left. eh, i guess the top above the vtx?","Mounting plates that the VTX would be soldered to, which would allow you to mount the VTX in a stack. 25x25 or 20x20 by the looks of it"
okay so i just bought cinelog 35 v2 and when i plug in usb micro my camera gets really hot i cant even hold my hands on it... is that normal?,can i use the 7 inch arms on sourceone v5 5 inch
"I was charging this pack and noticed it was a bit inflated, it wasn’t hot though and the bump is hard (not squishy), is it still safe to charge and use?","I'm building a fixed wing drone but I'm a little ignorant about the proportions of the parts so what should be size of vertical stabilizer of rc airplane https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/869321844199677973/1286386737182019656. Could you give us a photo that is from the side, not top side, cause it looks like it did puff up, but it's hard to tell if it's just the perspective or not You can/should also compare it to one of your healthy batteries to see if it's actually a significant puff"
its really hot cuz its not in the air? i thought u were joking :DDD. okay i pointed fan at it now,"No I'm not, our electronics are just meant to be cooled by the airflow while we fly"
will omni antennas work normally if theyre tilted 90°?,"You will just tilt their null zones 90° (and their whole beam), other than that it will work basically the same"
will the range be changed?. i know that omnis arent for range but im just asking,"This is the beam of an omni (here a truerc stubby) at the top it tells you which color corresponds to which gain, and the ""bubble"" is basically ""*the zone where you get signal*"" so if you tilt it 90°, you also tilt that ""bubble"" 90° and thus the zone where you get signal. To me it doesn't look that puffed. I would just be careful when charging it, then see if the performance is significantly degraded/if a cell is significantly lower voltage when you land/the iR of the cells, it will tell you if one of the cells is dying"
"So should I try charging it at 1c? (I always charge them at 1c). I’ll monitor its ir and temperature while charging. Are puffs usually puffy, like can you squish them?","Watch that motherfucker like it's holding lit matches and actively, vocally threatening to burn your house down.  Because it is. You could, 1c isn't particularly hard on the cells, just monitor it closely like fluke said If it’s that bad I’m not charging it… Puffed up LiPos are damaged. Damaged LiPos can short internally. That leads to ""thermal runaway scenarios"".. The cost of a LiPo is far less than your house. Replace it and move on is the safest course of action.  It's good practice to charge your LiPos in an old ammo can with the gasket removed. Contains any ""oh shit"" moments long enough to yeet the offending object over the horizon."
But do you think it looks puffed and are puffs squishy?,"(or at least, outside where it can burn off without getting anything else in on the party) It looks like you've twatted it off something and banana'd the pack a bit. Yo guys someone can help me everythime i did a roll and then it fall down"
@TridenT Was it strapped to the top of a quad that clipped an obstacle above it by any chance?. (Not that I would know *anything* about such things.... :KEKw: ),"Yeah, let us get right on that badly written, vague AF description of a problem. What does twatting and bananaing mean :face_with_tears_of_joy: Hitting really hard, and bending like a banana. Then the cells should be fine right. I might have crashed…really hard…really often"
Would your leg be fine if I bent it like a banana?,"Mal not that bad though. Obviously It might be, but I'd be wary of it personally. Yeah ofc. So bad there isn’t any way to know for sure before charging it Charge it outside, on longish leads, so if it goes, it won't torch anything you care about. But if it charges fine it’s fine right, like I don’t have to do this every time"
A battery safe bag is even better right?,"Lol Xd I didn’t know that :KEKw: That fibreglass bag will give you enough time to lob it, that's about it. while still making everything around it hot... I have one, they have their uses, but no, they're not anything like lithium fire proof."
Chat how hard is it to make a 4s out of this 6s with a broken balancer plug?,Not very if you know what you are doing Say less I’ll rip this puppy open next week. It’s been charged for maybe 2 months so hopefully it’s not clapped. Then I can have 2 1s 1200mah batteries lol
whenever I flip or dive my drone crashes. Guys?. Can someone help me,"some DVR would help. this can happen due to many different causes, from motor desync to skill issue digital video recording. basically your recording of your fpv video this is why it's called digital video recording, because it converts your analog feed into a digital medium, an SD card or other flash memory. as opposed to an analog magnetic tape. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder. most goggles have one built in but what does that have to do with the crash we can see if it's a motor desync or underpoweredness or a skill issue. and the OSD can tell us stuff too"
you don't have a recording of the flight?. not much you can do then besides record your flights and come to us when it happens again. can you do this maneuver in the sim?,"Wait maybe i have a video. Whenever I do a spin I can't do anything anymore, it just spins and crashes"
"I ordered a new vtx and receiver, I figure now i might as well just fuck the money out and build a new quad right? TH2F i like it but the tinysled plate i need to mount the new vtx and receiver is US shipping only, unless i wanna pay £40 for a piece of plastic",get a new quad and never touch the th2 again I assume you’re centering the sticks after… maybe a blackbox log would help if your quad has one. Perhaps ask in the betaflight discord…
am i able to put the rush tiny tank on a 5inch frame?,i mean yes. but it's underpowered
It has one but i cant go on bf right now what do you mean with centering the sticks?,"To roll you move the right stick to the left and the right. To stop rolling you move the right stick to the center I am ok with only 350mW, should be enough range and penetration for what i will use"
I was originally going to put it on the th2f but the plate is not available in eu. how do you mean?,outside. do you have enough space. why do you need a plate. just put it on there
"yes. tinysled makes this thing that you can put a nano vtx and a new receiver on for ELRS. otherwise i have no clue where i'd be able to mount the rush tiny tank. https://tinysleds.com/products/emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-vtx-rx-sled?srsltid=AfmBOoqhHGHjeHU9BCRxvgvlW_zzAuKci6KveHWnC0xf_BfeQNodiR9N. i need to fix it you are right, fucking i need to find the parts again for it","these two are honestly better solutions That is the plate i am meaning, there are some pictures attached you can see it goes in place of the old vtx"
do you mean the speedybee f405 flight controllers?,"i really have no idea, im really new to this shit ngl. im just gonna delete my comment in shame"
"iirc the ""F722"" and ""F405"" is the name of a specific type of chip on the board, not the actual model or brand of product?. -# (i think?)",yes thats my understanding of it. but since its ali express i cant assume that its the same quality as if i bought it from a real brand neither f722 and f405 are very future proof. not that it matters
"alright, so what do i go for? f405 or f722. Im trying to make a quad with gps capabilities so it can go beyond my fpv range and operate autonomously",f405. you literally can't use the f722 for any autonomous software. and the f405 is becoming underpowered for it
okay. f405 is becoming underpowered for autonomous operations?. then what board should i go for instead? if the f405 might be underpowered,well the f405 can do all of it. I'm just saying it is reaching the end of its lifespan in the next year or three
what is taking its place?,"for Ardupilot specifically ye, thats the program im trying to utalize as much as possible, im trying to write a paper on this stuff but i really know nothing about it i just have an interest for drones lol. Thats why im asking so many perhaps stupid questions there's an f7 with some more flash space. f765 or whatever it is. but those are uncommon. h7 chips are usually the next step up if you absolutely need more than the f405 i see that these h7's are also 3x the price lol sometimes. yeah. for the record, f722's are more powerful than f405's. but the f722's don't have enough flash space for ardupilot"
"Ive heard a little about sbus and smartport and my understanding so far is that it allows for more data transfer (and faster) so that i can recieve good to have data such as voltage, gps coordinates etc. Will the f405 support that? If not does the f722 do that?  this convo is actually really helpful so far, thank you for that","first of all, if you're somehow using sbus you are doing something wrong. SBUS just uses 1 signal wire and it really isn't great. and all the protocols that do use SBUS are outdated i guess i have been looking at outdated sources. Its really hard to find what is relevant nowadays expresslrs pretty much. unless you want to pay a lot of money for slightly better, expresslrs"
whats the best existing antenna setup for hdzero rn?. for both goggles and vtx,"there is never a best. but the most reasonable would probably be combining two TrueRC X2-Air MK2, then two random omnis on top that clear your head. and then just a random good omni for the vtx honestly not really. but kind of. so the way omnis work is that the higher gain they have, the less omnidirectional they are if that makes sense. and if you are getting the truerc ""patches"", you would probably want wayyy more omni omnis than that"
so a whole truerc antenna setup?. what ghz rating should i go with?. and should i use lhcp or rhcp?. im still talking about hdzero,"dji osmo 5 pro or gopro 12 5.8ghz is the frequency hdzero (and almost every vtx in this hobby in general) uses, and for the polarity, probably rhcp but just use the same as the polarity on your quad"
"I saw a little bat header inside my pocket, can I utilize it? and how???. I want to train but I don't have batteries for it yet, I built an old 21700 pack so I'm wondering if it would work, I already have that type of connector in male I think","Long as the voltage of your built pack is of the right range, yeah, I reckon that should work.  Don't get the polarity wrong though, that won't end well. Don't worry, I won't, but I'm afraid its disabled or its for something else, I looked online and I couldn't find any info about it There's a lot of ""undocumented features"" in Radiomaster gear, oddly."
I have the speedybee f7 v3 FC and have Bridged the 5v and the Buzz + Pad. Ist that a problem?. My good soldering iron is broken and the bad One cant unbrige It,"I guess this is a fuck around and find out, time to do exactly that.. @HoleSlurper traditionally, Buzz+ is just 5V. might be 4V5.. hm Good news! It worked... We love jank :red_heart:"
"Have you changed anything recently? Was this issue happening before, or is this a new quad?",Yo guys my drone chrashed every time i did a flip or dive I didnt did anything i it not a new one
So this just randomly started happening? Did you have a particularly hard crash at any point before this that could have caused damage?,"Ist randomly happening i just crashed a bit becaus of this. But bevor bot. Not @Scootzronnn looks like a motor desync. Try raising your throttle idle in beta flight or using dynamic idle. The issue though is that that is a new problem, and we don't know what caused it"
Can someone help me with that?. The googles cant pair with the drone,Oh thats digital. I do not know how that works unfortunately :face_with_diagonal_mouth: Someone else will probably be here in a few minutes to help
"Ah the classic ""Would you read the manual for me?""","Even though you answered 2 minute later your response wasnt fast enough :lul:. I hate when that happens so often too.

I often encounter that people doesnt reply, because its more difficult than they expected half the walksnail pairing issues boil down to what is written in the piece of paper you get with the dang product. just didn't follow the instructions close enough Or the ""google that for me"" How can i do that ( im begginer"
Have you ever used beta flight before?,put it on the last one still doesnt work. keeps blinking. and saying tat the transmitter is disconnected i would like if you answered the rest of the questions
"i think i answerd all of your questions, did i miss something?","yes i did press the buttons in the same oreder, tried standing further away and put the googles on the last channel. but it doesnt work try putting it back on 25mbps and setting it to channel 8 or ""CHP"" whatever it is called in the menu"
ok did it. now what. try bind it again?,yup. button on the vtx first. and then the goggles nopr. e. look. Idont know why but it keep saying the transmitter is disconnected
"how do i know?. wait i think i found the problem. listen to the sound, is it supposed to be like that? (i upgrade the googles again). it the same sound i heard in the first update. nvm its good",Yeah thanks for referring me to the manual that helped me loads :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
"im trying to custom my osd, the googles are connected to the drone but i cant see things that i put on the screen (like the battery voltage for exmaple). can someone help me with that?",Does the air65 have durability issues I've seen people complain about the frames breaking in a specific spot but mine have been mostly fine
anyone know any transmitters that can also fold up like the tango 2?. or how to customize our own radios to be like that,"RadioMaster Pocket, Jumper T20 okay thanks :thumbs_up: T20 has full-size gimbals and is still really small, it's pretty awesome. most other radios you can also mod to fold the antennas and such yeah i’ve see. i currently have a tx12"
What batteries should i get for 6s build?,Thats what im wondering. For tbs source v5 frame 1100-1300mAh. you can get a bit more if you're flying with no gopro
"And which brand you recommend? Sorry to ask again and also how many should i get, 3-4, 10?",hey guys i still sadly have 1 last issue my vtx because it can output 800mw but when its on 400mw or 200mw i still get better video signal so is there a way too fix my range and video feed when i want too use 800mw because i can't get further then 20/50 meters with 800mw and i am using the tx800 from speedybee
why not use 400 or 200 if it gives better signal?,"The components used in that VTX are not always the greatest quality. It is possible that the PA chip is not able to output the advertised maximum output power, and unfortunately the only way to ""fix"" it is to replace it with a better VTX"
"is there a way to make a race track for my 3"" here?",if there's a will theres a way
any ideas?. i dont really know how to make a good race track. or can i get any advice on how to do it myself?,"does anyone have a picture of the connector cable for the foxeer t rex micro was looking to upgrade the camera on my iflight nazgul eco, but it seems they use a different cable, just wanna see if the port on my stack will work, ive checked foxeers website for the micro the picture of the cable isnt really clear where i can see it compared to mine"
Hey guys what does rtc battery low mean? Ive charged it for 2 hours and it still says it,the battery for the internal clock is empty. you can change it or just ignore it you dont really need it Ahh ok thats fine then probably. Thanks
"Another quick question, i have an O3 air unit and i want to have the setting auto record on so i dont forget to turn on recording but it stops before i have a chance to get footage of the post flight statistics. Is there any way to stop the recording automatically 5 sec after disarm or do i need to start the recording manually and try not to forget?",An automatic delay to stop recording after disarm would require changing the firmware. Only DJI gets to do that. Just do it manually and don't forget like we all used to do

the drone is causing it?. if yes im just gonna buy this and ill be fineee. the aio is the only thing breaking anyways so...,"geprc will also not be the greatest quality. and that is too much money well how much should i spend then primarily you want to look for a good brand well some examples would be skystars, diatone, airbot, sequre, hobbywing. axisflying maybe <https://www.modell-hubschrauber.at/RC-FPV-Racer-Kameras-Videobrillen-und-co/FPV-Racer-Flugsteuerungen-und-Zubehoer/Flugsteuerungen-fuer-FPV-Racer/RubberQuads-AIRBOT-Fenix-AIO::64460.html> <https://shop.rubberquads.com/products/airbot-fenix-aio>. something like this for example mkay. so i have a good radio (i dont have anything to compare it with so im guessing), ill have a good drone (i wont), and im gonna upgrade to hdzero soon (in like 2-4 years i guess) i thought you got an rtf kit lucky in some ways then i guess. the tx12 is a bit older but there's nothing wrong with it yeah the goggles are doodoo. theyre enough for me but still doodoo how much did you spend"
how much money did i waste?,"that + the amount you're spending on the AIO you're getting now could've gotten you cobra x, a decent radio and a really nice toothpick setup meh. idc that much. i thought that the drone i have is nice (besides the aio) the aio is like half the drone"

Yea this is bad.,"Hey y'all what should I be charging these at it says 1 amp but I know for a fact that's not true. hey guys, I just built a new quad but there's no video. vtx is powered on. I just get a black screen. no osd Generally to charge lipo batteries  safely you charge at 1c so on that battery it would be 1.3 amps, you can always charge a battery slower but charging one faster is a risk, although you can usually get away with a bit faster I was chilling at 2.2. But like. I don't like fires. I would probably go slower than that. Good point Hi, so yesterday I banged my quad real good... as you can see https://tenor.com/view/balance-charging-lipo-fire-burn-kloppokoppter-gif-11906004 I connected it to betaflight and its working to a degree If it even works that's a w Oh wait no there is 1 very.small scratch on the arm I used a smokestopper to plugin a Lipo and everything seems ""ok"", but I can't seem to turn on the motors though"
I'm guessing the 100% E means error??,"close betaflight, open <https://esc-configurator.com/> in a chromium browser. try reading the settings with that But when I connect the lipo, the motors do move. Got it there's also a good chance the plug between the fc and esc is loose. so check that first I mean.. it was loose-ish. Lemme try again after that replug. Hell yeah!. That was it! the plug was loose! the motors work !! haha ever so slightly loose on those JST plugs pretty much means there's a bad connection lol Very true, it's just that I only made a visual inspection and didn't try to push them a little further"
lol I didn't even notice your fpv camera. lesson learnt on having it stick out the cage I guess. does the gopro still work?,"haha yeah, the camera got ripped apart... I was flying freestyle, trying new tricks but it was kinda windy... around 40km/h... I couldn't control it in one of the tricks and smashed it hard against a light post. The gopro turns on, but I'm gonna replace it at bestbuy, I bought the ensurance. The culprit... hahaha. Yeah, i'm gonna have to set it little further back next time hehe. It's acting weird though... let me send you a vid. The turning on sound repeats three times... I'm looking into the manual for the FC to find out what it could be, but it's not normal for sure. And I can't bind it to my TX either. It doesn't seem to transmit the wifi signal to check if the binding phrase got reset it is missing a motor. lol"
I don't know what's up with the receiver. is it still connected?,"Yeah, it was flashing green like crazy (ELRS) like when it's gone to wifi mode. Well.. the camera works! hahaha. It's transmitting to the googles, obviously nothing quite visible but, technically, I could just get a new lense and it might work haha... won't risk it though Impressive. I'd risk it haha nah, I don't have an fpv store close by so.. I'd rather spend a couple more bucks insted of doing two trips. I might buy the lense and have it as a backup, just in case"
are the antennas intact?,"why is this happening. just nothing. black screen me when I don't plug in the camera Could be a faulty connection. That's happened to me. Well, I'm stumped with the ELRS RX @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). It blinks as it should, but never binds. Everything is properly connected to the FC and no wire or connection looks damaged. I even tested it out with my multimeter Don't know why I can't bind or get it to transmit wifi. They look like it, the connector is untouched and the antenna seems to be whole I would try to flash it again I guess, to rule out software weirdness and to see if all of that still works. But I'll try with it with another antenna from another quad. I'll try that too"
"Can i connect the DJI O3 Air Unit with non dji vr headsets, and a fpv monitor screen?","no, only the v2 goggles have some kind of output. You want to use Walksnail, HDZero or Analog for that. Walksnail is pretty much on-par with DJI and does have a VRX oh. do you know if i can connect it to my phone. like on the dji app. for close range stuff the v2 goggles can do it via a cable. but again... don't go DJI if you want to do anything that is outside the scope of just flying alr. what camera do you reccomend. i need a cheap vr headset. and a screen that can also connect. that somebody can watch on"
what do you need a VR headset for?...,so you mean fpv goggles not... virtual reality what is your budget for goggles then 250 with camera and goggles. is that enough
"what motor size should i use for 3""?",Yes it gets quite hot
What format does the Cobra x accept for video?,I only use my cobras to fly my quad. Never watched any video on them.
do i need to put a o3 in a o3 frame?,i use analog and the the only frames i see are for the o3 the o3 camera is too wide to fit most frames. oh. yeah no any analog build will work with an ''O3 Frame''
so what should i go with?,https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 oh ok. ty. sry for the dumb question
"What cameras 2"", 3"" drones uses? I already have Eachine AIO tx06 analog but its 25mW",i think it doesnt. im pretty sure youll need an external module
25mw? i run on 200mw and it isnt enough for me. maybe because i use it on bad antenas,I used it on old project oh mkay. i think i would buy a caddx ant but dont listen to me because i dont give good advice
does it have brushed motors?. if yes then 25mw is enough,yeah 25mw is enough imo. + you said its a toy so it wont fly far For nano drone is good. About a football field. I took the motors only i think you should buy new motors But they are twice as big than reqular nano drone motors. 1503 notors. I want to save myself from buying motors so that's why I'm building abomination :face_with_tears_of_joy:
mkay. what controller do you have?,No conntroller for now but I am planning to buy radiomaster pocket yeah its a good choice. i think if you stayed in the middle of the footbal field it should be enough. for now you can try with the camera you have and if it wont be enough you just can buy a better one I have one last queation
1S. The motors was used on 3.7V battery so it should work?,i would say that its underpowered but if the only thing you want to do is to lift off the ground you can try then. normally 1s toothpicks use motors like 10000kv-20000kv https://rotorbuilds.com/build/31579 i found this on google. you can see the parts if you want to
the name of the prop should always be facing up. you know what i mean?,you should feel it with your finger We'll see but i think Its good when i checked some photos of that drone props are faced the same way yeah im pretty sure you did it right
Yes it Is .... Really?. Well for indoor flights i think ill buy cineape 25 ... Cinelog 35v2 Will be for bike trails etc,"I flew mine under a chair once and it lightly tapped, then proceeded to burn out an ESC, motor, and break the frame. Basically totaled it Just tested outside And it work prefectly. It could be bad timing but still thanks for info darwinfpv stuff isnt the thing i would recomend you to buy"
What do you recommend for indoor flying that can handle GoPro hero 12?,flywoo flylens 85 is a good option imo. im not sure if it isnt too fast for indoor but its a great drone Other people in drone servers told me that most of the time you get broken drone from darwinfpv
Is it better to buy AIO parts and build a drone?,"depends on what drone you want to make Instead of purchesing prebuild drone Prebuild is often cheaper, either get a BNF or pick custom parts. I would recommend building a drone identical to a BNF I was thinking about getting BetaFPV F4 A5 AIO flight controller (with JST connectors, build in VTX and ELRS)  and than the focus will be on motors and frame"
what do you want to build?,"it is really easy to mess up something if you didnt build a drone before imo. you can always just buy the parts from a bnf and build it Well, parts I have right now: - 1503 motors (around 2800 kv) - camera + goggles - Larva X frame - 2"" 3 blades props  I want to build nano drone as the frame is 2.5"" or 100 mm wheelbase"
"1503 2800kv?. that's really odd, can you send a link to those?","Not sure of the kv, the motors are unbranded 2800kv is extremely low. that's for like 6s on 2.5-3"" yeah thats what i meant by that. ."
are these the darwinfpv ones?,They are twice bigger than normal nano drone motors I don't think those will be easy to mount if yes then forget it I will try them soon. The frame has extra screw holes. Sort of
oh okay. what kind of toy was that?,"I don't know any frame that has mounting like this wait a minute i thought you said that the motors are brushed and no props that have mounting like this No, brusheless. Worst case I will have to buy new motors i think you can drill holes in the frame. im not sure"
Frames usualy has 9mm x 9mm patterns?. Or frame with already drilled holes,"I bought this one. You can see where the original holes were I'm not sure that'd work either. and even if you were able to mount the motors, they would not run well at all unless you use 6s batteries yeah he wants to use 1s The worked on 3.7V. 1S batteries are also 3.7V. It should work... just because they spin does not mean that they will perform well"
do you want to actually fly or lift off the ground and hover for 15 secs?. how do i remove a switch in my tx12smk2?. ive opened it but i have no clue on how to unscrew the part thats holding it. do you have a dji drone?,then why do you want dji goggles The good display and the ability to build a digital quad at some point in the future
you have a o3 module in your drone rn?,And rn id use it with an analog module for tinywhooping analog is something like 480p No just analog rn. I know. Flown analog quite alot you dont need a wild display for analog
https://oscarliang.com/digidapter-adapter/ maybe this will help?,DJI makes everything incompatable with everything. I won't risk idk if its for v2 but i will check
Then what should i buy?. I wanna get digital eventualy,On v2 its also possible im p sure
why would they make a module then? im pretty sure itll work. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK76lqkVHDU. found it,Yeah it possible. I just wanted to see if anybody here had done it before
At which cell average Voltage do u guys land your quads?,always 3.5V per cell. 1s stuff a little lower
"sounds right. but lipos can handle 3.2, even 3.0 per cell at min. why do most people land at 3.5?","Because when you fully discharge it down to 3.2/3.0v you damage it a lot more than if you land at 3.5v, so by not discharging them fully we significantly increase their lifespan"
all rightt. and just to be safe I assume. thanks. what's the highest C rate you've ever charged a lipo?,"""some"" is not ""all"". unless we can be for sure that that specific cell can handle it, anything below like 3.3V will damage it yea okay. makes sense I usually charge at 2C all the time, I've done 3C a few times cool. I'm doing 1.3~C because I'm using cheaper equipment. tryna play it safe. generate less heat u know damn. my slowass been on 1C all dis time I only do it because I believe I can do it safely. I have the charger practically right next to me when I'm working"
wouldn't that in your case make it more risky? Since you can't see if the liPos is expanding,"same, u should always watch your lipos when charging well same, and I charge it inside an ammo box its on the ground. im in a chair since you're near it u could stop it if it isn't sealed then it's good also yeah, if you get an ammo box. please remove the seal. otherwise :face_with_tears_of_joy: what does that have to do with this"
Wait are iflight motors good?. What do people normally get,I have iflight XingE 2207 motors and im 100% fine with them. On my Custom quad
this motor size is for 3s packs?,size doesnt really have anything to do with voltage. but yeah. i mean it mostly depends on the weight
So ive got flywoo x30 antiwater spray And i dunno if i should cover USB port on my FC ... Also what else should i not spray with it?,"1404 is a great size for 3"" props regardless of voltage. You need to tailor the *Kv* to the voltage you plan to run. Do not spray any plug with it. Unless you never want to use that plug again. Don't spray a barometer with it 1103 is too small for a 3"" prop, much better for 2"" or 2.5"" I dont think i have barometer on my FC (GEPRC f722 45A AIO) And every plug is plugged ... Thanks"
im in beta flight rn and hit flash firmware but its stuck in initlating reboot to bootloader. how to fix?,That happens to me and I can’t fix it either. Out of curiosity what drone is it
why are you trying to flash?,"new build, was following a guild i assume you're on windows Oh ok I see I was just curious cause mine was a Cetus X that did that. I just unplugged it but I don’t recommend that <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe>. close betaflight and open that. don't replug it"
I have a question when I am soldering my motor to my ESC is it fin that the motor wires are touching? Will it short my drone?,"Pfffft, I have 1404 4600kV motors on my 4s 2.5"".  No kill like overkill :face_with_tears_of_joy: Lol for sure! Motor too beeg is much better than motor too smol So I soldered a betafpv air75 together into a new 5 in 1 because my 4 in 1 died. It worked for a bit before losing rx, and then when I went closer to get signal again, it fell out of the sky within a few seconds and wont turn on anymore Honestly, It could do with a little more punch for it's weight, but at the end of the day, it's a Cinewhoop.. Only so good it's gonna get.. Best I'm going to get at this point is playing with prop angle. no the exposed wires should not be touching each other. if they even have the chance to, you're soldering them wrong Why does my drone do this everytime i try to land :DDD He looks like he is excited for next flight :PepeLaughGrin:. He does this at 0 throttle I think BF 4.5 has a new CLI command I believe it does help with that.. set mixer_type = EZLANDING Air mode and ground effect, it's normal.. yeah that's going to explode and die pretty much, those wires are way too big for those pads and you haven't cut them off nearly enough."
I've had someone convert a gopro for me to a naked version. I just been watching videos on how to make gopros power up from balance lead. The guy added a bec between the balance lead and the jst connector that went into the gopro. Surely that's not required?.  On the other hand I've seen people use leads like this eith no bec.,"some naked gopro adapter boards have an onboard BEC You can always add airmode to A switch and turn it off. I have done that for all my cinewhoops.. Perfect that makes sense. Ty. Yep I missed that in his info page! Why your paid the big bucks!!! He has the nameless rc bec! walksnail cant work with dji googles right only hdzero no, the systems aren't compatible at all"
dji only with their air units. if i put a receiver mod on my googles i could fly analog with them?,"depends on which goggles they are, only some support it"
Someone gave any feedback here about the newest tinnywhoop? newbeedrone v3 and the other from betafpv?,the newbeedrone quads are too heavy. the Air 65 is good
"Do you know guys if radiomaster makeing like transparent or carbon fiber case for pocket ? Swap cases got huge discount right now , like 50%",there are transparent shells for the pocket Not fully transparent. Like on Boxer. Without any color I guess the white pocket is a bit more frosty Omg mine does that too :face_with_tears_of_joy: yeah i have the v2 and i got the steady view x
"Hey everyone, is there a way to get an OSD with an TBS unifi nano 32 and a pwm receiver or do i need an fc with BF for that?","Depends on the motors' kV, voltage of LiPo and the prop specs really.  Easy answer, get both and see which works best. You cannot get an OSD without a flight controller.. Now, you don't have to use Betaflight, there are other options Oh oke thanks. Ig il just fly till ifly out of the sky XD Set a timer on your radio, use telemetry alarms, use a voltage beeper. You have other options"
hey im building my first fpv drone and im wondering if the analog or digital camera depends on the camera alone or the fc too?,"it depends on the camera and video transmitter. and what your goggles work with. if you have an analog camera with an analog vtx, you need an analog goggle. if you have a walksnail camera with a walksnail vtx, you need a walksnail goggle ok so it all works together pretty much with some fine print text attached. your analog stuff needs to be able to use the same frequencies, all goggles are 5.8 and every vtx you'll normally find also is. all walksnail stuff works together. all hdzero stuff works together. and DJI is a giant mess and pain in the ass so you'll just have to specifically search each combination to see if it works"
is it worth going this route than using BetaFPV's batteries?,avoid the blue betafpv batteries at all costs. they are complete utter garbage compared to folded cell batteries. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250 I guess I have to go smaller capacity but higher quality
Doesn’t betafpv sell 550mah folded?,"Shipping any sort of batteries that aren't BetaFPV here is pretty much impossible Yeah the BetaFPV Lava 550mah cells are folded yup, they'd know that if they clicked the link above. with all the info they could possibly want I clicked. but. It's not helping i dun even know what that is Basically, middle wast. east**"
can't order from China either?,"i mean I assume you'd want someone who can ship with DHL Aramex / EMS / DHL, yes Well the rxbt sensor always reads 6V Okay, so I guess I'm forced to use BetaFPV batteries. I'm gonna buy both, I'll give them a shot, I may just use the smaller ones for indoor flying, but I'm unsure how well will it fit in the 75 Pro battery compartment Uhh 2 inches exist, not sure if a 65 counts as one"
Why does the RM Pocket have an adjustable antenna? What's the point,"So when you pack it the antenna doesn't get damaged, it's a great feature and I wished they would have also put it on the boxer cause if you forget to remove the antenna (which wears on the sma) then the plastic bracket that holds the sma in place breaks and your antenna just wiggles around Not foldable, rather you can literally turn it 90 degrees Because the antenna doesn't have perfect spherical coverage. Linear antennas have null points where their reception is much weaker. Actually all antennas have null points, really Oh, that part, it's to better align the antennas, basically, you want your dipoles to be aligned to get the best range. And it also lets you put the null zone in a better direction"
"Hey guys, so yesterday I spent all day flying fpv and ran into an issue. Randomly out of nowhere my vtx wouldn’t work properly, I would have to place my drone on top of my goggles to be able to see the dvr. When I checked the beta flight settings in the osd the vtx smart audio wasn’t there. After a bit of waiting and plugging the battery in and out it would suddenly just start working again. Why the hell was it doing this?",I thought so in the beginning but I went over 40 mins without flying and it happened Add vtx temp to your osd.
how do i measure camera angle easily. do i need a tool or can i do it with a protractor?,"what's the difference between having props in pusher mode. and pull mode. cuz I've seen quads with inverted props and motors If they are anything like computers, below 70c° would be considered safe. 70-90°c it would likely slow down or shut down. 105°c+ shutdown you quickly destroy your motor shaft on regular frames. theyll fly the same (somewhat). just youll likely have less props in view since they can be lower I like keeping my motor shafts intact. sooo. thank you if the frame is made for pusher its fine. just landing on your motors is kinda suboptimal lol Kinda tilt the camera until it looks like it's about the amount you want it to be tilted"
i see my camera but i dont see osd any reasons?. geprc rad 1w vtx. geprc f722 45a aio. (Cinelog 35v2 drone),"Plug the drone into pc and open Betaflight configurator, tip drone until camera is looking horizontal, read pitch angle from screen.. Adjust as required, tighten screws. You have the video format set to HD but you're using an analog VTX how are you getting anything at all. unless its digital. which it isnt. (im very good at reading) It's possible that there's no valid SA signal from the FC because there's no VTX settings, so the VTX would default to its own settings from the manual controls :dracthyr_love_animated:"
What depends how far can fpv drone go?,"Everything. RC link quality, FPV quality, weight, size, power, efficiency so how would a kit with ev800d nuzgul dc5 with dji 03 with radiomaster pocket control you wouldn't get very far because you wouldn't be able to see yeah i guess it depends on how good your eyes are Yea the EV800D is not compatible with a DJI O3. So you will see this. https://tenor.com/view/static-tv-static-gif-19838894. Kudos to whomever else can see the image in that GIF"
i can see that there is something. is thast good enough?,I'll give you one kudo so what kit should i do with this nuzgul preferrebly to not be so expensive. and i could ve wear it with glasses dont get the o3 version. just get the nazgul xl5 eco. or whatever its called. something eco tho
so with basic version? not a dead cut isee. iflight nuzgul xl5 eco i think. it s 200$,"so what gogles. that i can wear with glasses also have you ever flown before no clue if you can wear glasses under them no but i was practicing on a simulator a lot you probably can. how much is alot Yea you can get glasses under the EV800D. I wouldn't call it comfortable, but you can do it"
so which glasses i should buy to wear with glasse? :Harold:,"You can get custom diopters made for just about every binocular goggle, so that's always an option if your eyesight truly is bad.. But most every modern binocular goggle has adjustments built in i have like -5. i m near sightet"
can i ask a question or should i wait rn?,Most go down to -6 I think. Shoot. Just remember to keep hitting the reply so I don't lose track they arent adjustable Box goggles typically have no adjustment you need to get custom ones made. or just wear glasses. or get better goggles i need a long range vtx that mounts on 20mmx20mm so which CHEAP goggles can i get. with this function
will there be any 1000mw options in this size?,how much are you willing to spend on goggles alone idk like i was thinking up to 200 :51eb15969e674b3f9a23ff3fdc30c0ba: Skyzone cobra x has cutouts for glasses yeah cobra x v2/v4 i guess. theyre 250. i think
alr. and how abt first drone?. nuzgul xl5 ecowill be good?,i mean yeah but you shouldnt really jump into the deep end immediatly Be the change you want to see in the world i was thinking about the geprc rad mini or diatone mamba ultra I feel like I just had this conversation. One sec
did i accidentally do a thread?,The RushFPV Solo MAX and Tank Solo both have 20x20 mount. Looks like the Mamba *can* be 20x20 mounted. I'm given to understand that the GepRC stuff's quality isn't as good
are there any better options? (ik i dont need anything better but im just asking),"Foxeer Reaper Extreme looks like it also has a 20x20 naa its too big. i need it to fit in a 3"" frame Well. You should have led with that this looks suspiciously like a rush vtx *They might be made in the same factory* :PepeSus: i threw a hglrc zeus 800mw thingy in the back of mine at some point. before @riksa bought it and then proceeded to fly it back to china never to be seen again"
can you check this list and tell me whats good in it? only the first 2 pages https://fpvmarket.eu/?s=1000mw+20x20&country=europe#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=1000mw%2020x20&gsc.page=1,rest in pieces hglrc zeus :(
i was going to buy the 800mw zeus. so do i buy this one or what?,"The RushFPV Tank Mini is 20x20 and goes up to 800mw. You could also VHB mount one of the TBS Unify Nanos, I can't remember how high they get. But 800mW should get you about as much range as you'd want out of a 3"" anyway"
mkay. can you tell me what range i should expect from it with good antennas?,"so wich one of cheap options should i buy It's really hard to say, even if I assume you have great antennas it can depend on your local environment a lot https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639. i dont think ive ever used that shopping list more in a singular day than today wich of those are the most advanced I think they meant which goggles. Oh maybe not np man thanks to ya both i'm very proud for my actions:saluting_face: Is it rotating. Something that is rotating. That is the only thing I see"
how do goggle antennas work?. theyre sending signals to get signals?. i dont get it,"Antennas on an analog goggle (and HDZero) only receive. On Walksnail and DJI, one of the four antennas is a transmit antenna that sends data to the VTX and the other three are receive antennas"
DJI has diversity TX no?,"I'm less sure now that you've asked. But regardless, antennas by themselves do not receive or transmit. It depends what they're connected to"
why do we have directional and omni antennas then if they dont send any signals? it seems like there isnt any difference,"Think of it like this. You can have an omni antenna that radiates outward in all directions, or a directional one that radiates in a particular direction yeah i know how they work So you have an omni antenna to cover the area that the directional doesn't cover. If you only have directional antenna pointing in front of you, you get no coverage behind i just dont understand how does the signal from antennas work. if they aint outputting any signals The ""radiation pattern"" of an antenna is simply where the antenna is sensitive. If you hook it up to a transmitter, that's where it will broadcast to. If you hook it up to a receiver, that's where it will receive from"
what makes it sensitive to a specific range?,"Sensitive in a particular shape of 3d space. The physical construction of the antenna determines its gain. That isn't measured in feet or meters, it's measured in signal ""noise"" or strength, dBi/dBm thats not what i meant"
Oh you mean frequency?,"Try rephrasing the question :yellow_heart:. I sound like an AI. As a Drone Community moderator, I can only answer questions as intelligently as they are posed. :face_with_tongue:"
when the power goes through the antennas what happens with the energy inside the antenna?. if it doesnt get outputted,"It radiates away as either photons or heat. Anything that isn't a photon is heat. Or, well, both. Sort of. RF is complicated"
how does a receiver antenna receive?,"Basically the same process in reverse. Photons hit the element and excite a current into the circuit The photons flying off a transmitter antenna get caught in the receive antenna and become electric current, basically. question abt propellers what does less propellers mean and vice versa for more OH I GET IT NOW. TYSM If you could be a little more specific so the amount of blades like 2 3 4 etc More blades means more thrust, but also more drag so lower RPM and more current draw. Fewer blades means less thrust, but more RPM and fewer amps Radio waves are photons of such high frequency you can't see them, if that helps further. Low frequency, but yea so if i want the air75 with 3 blades i have to change or is there a version with 3"
"Is it? lol, what an error on my part.....",Yea visible light is in the hundreds of THz. Just buy different props. You can change them easily Of all the things to learn today... what would you recommend
"one last queston: why are there so many receivers if all of them do the same thing? i understand that there is frsky, elrs, (...) and there are receivers for other stuff than drones but why are there hundreds elrs ones for example if all of them do the same thing?","Every company wants money, so they design and sell their own version of the hardware. They can make decisions about the quality of the components that they use, the electrical layout, the antenna quality, etc, all of which can change the overall performance of the receiver. Don't get confused between a receiver firmware and the physics of reception though. FRsky and ELRS both use radio frequencies to send data, that doesn't make them equivalent. The Air75 uses 40mm props, and BetaFPV sells a bunch of different options. Props are a personal choice, just pick a few you think you'll like and try them. They're cheap. https://betafpv.com/collections/40mm-propellers yeah ik that theyre different i just needed to tell a example ok ill have a look thks"
Did you read the spec sheet?,its a rush tank ult 2
"Hey I kinda wanna get into FPV Drones & a good friend of mine gifted me a self build FPV Drone I really wanna get into the hobby since I already made a A1+A3 license and find drones very interesting. Since I do not have a transmitter, I do know the drone has a FrSky receiver but since I wanna start out is it possible to use something else like a PS4/Xbox Controller to get started? Since I am a novice & don't want to destroy my little baby that soon and get slowly started into flying :). I appreciate every help & answer I am also willing to share all the details I know about the drone inc. Pictures! I once again, thank anyone willing to help in this amazing community :red_heart:","Sucks to be you, but the literadio is trash, new gimbals or no. You can use a game controller in a simulator, but it's not great. I'd get a Radiomaster Pocket ELRS, it can be used in a simulator and then to fly the real drone as well. then just get an ELRS receiver to replace the FrSky one in the drone and you're set I will look into this, thank you :)"
does a lower packet rate give higher latency and higher range or lower latency and lower range?,higher latency and higher range
okay ty. so 1000hz is for racers? or something like that,"sending less often (lower Hz) means that each bit can be sent for a longer time, making it more readable for the receiver, thus resulting in a higher range. pretty much"
and 50hz for long range?,"Most people default to something like 250Hz (not D250) until they figure out which way they want to go i fly on 250hz. it seems to be the most balanced one for my type of flying Yeah that's fairly typical. you get great responsiveness without sacrificing much in terms of range i think im gonna test out 500hz when i fix my drone and see the difference (if im even gonna feel it) and you don't have to worry about the higher packet rates interacting with the PID tuning. if you change the packet rate, make sure to apply the appropriate ELRS packet rate preset"
not only in the radio?,"Betaflight has to process the inputs that it gets.. It has to smooth them out and predict them a bit.. Its default settings work for up to 250Hz, but beyond that it starts to be problematic. (even 250 can be improved) That's why there are ELRS presets available in the Presets tab. for the various packet rates (for which it matters)"
wait how can i improve it? do i change the preset?. or its something more complicated?. oh i get it. okay,"Each ELRS preset has you pick the ""fine-tuning"". Race = least filtering (most immediate but unsmooth stick response)  Ultra Cinematic = most filtering (delayed but very smooth response)"
how does the filtering work?,"For example, this is how I would set it up for most of my use-cases:. Then I'd click Pick and then Save and Reboot"
wait so i should use race for freestyle? it gives the most precise outputs if that makes sense,"It gives the fastest response, but it is very harsh. it can make the quad feel... neurotic, twitchy xD. and it can increase the load on the motors and escs. I wouldn't recommend the race setting for freestyle :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
what does neurotic mean?. oh okay,"anxious, shaky hands, etc"
"For once I'm the one asking here... let's say I have 1103 8500kv motors. Those would do well on a 2"" freestyle-ish frame on 2-3s, right?","https://tenor.com/view/once-again-asking-gif-18234786473894858127 Personally I would use them on a 2.5"" 2s let's say that the motor wires aren't long enough for 2.5"" that's a lot of work though. there also aren't many good light 2.5"" frames here Eh, my 2.5"" runs 3S on 1103 7500Kv motors and it's fantastic There are a few, iirc you are in the eu and you have the kayoumini that recently released that seems pretty good. And you also have the armattan tadpole I had a 2.5"" toothpick on 2s 1103 8500kv and it was okay but not great, I wonder if 2"" and 3S would be more fun Maybe, I love my 2"" 2s with 11000kv motors, but you would need to find some fairly small batteries for it to not be a brick I found some 380mAh 3s HV packs. even smaller than 450mAh I was planning to use That should work well enough, I personally use some 450mah 2s, and it already feels kinda heavy (granted I have hd on it, and 1103 is on the bigger side for 2"") 8500kv is kinda meh for 2s, I hope it'll do better on 3s"
Race wire?. Flywoo makes some tiny ones,"I don't think they're sold here. yeah just checked the 4 main stores, nothing Might have to go AE https://flywoo.net/products/4-pcs-flywoo-arm-led-board-light-1-2-bits-4-15mm-1-4s <https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/impulserc-apex-race-wire-4pcs-5656.html> These might be small enough"
"Otherwise, why not solder more wire to the existing wire and just tape down the wires where you spliced in the new wires ?",Not anymore than racewires
rather how many batteries do you guys usually use on standard day when you flying?,"How on Earth do you even solder that…. *good, without all the solder bridging Carefully.. (middle one first). (then hit the side ones from the edges to avoid melting the middle one) how many batteries should i buy> I would just go from one side to the other. but starting in the middle does sound better Depends size drone and how much you want to fly 5inch with 6s 1350mah dogcom batteries A larger 5” will fly for ~5 mins per battery, and each battery costs $30. I have done more solder (re)work than I care to even contemplate. Path of least resistance is instinct at this stage.  Just left to right works if your hands are steady enough, and mine aren't anymore :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
"So if you want to fly ~30 mins, 5ish batteries might be good? 3 might be good to start tho so you don’t spend too much at once","See this is the part i am at now, i have bought everything apart from frame, props and batteries I have at least 6 batteriis for all of my drones yeah 3 sounds like a good middle point 6 for the 5"", 6 for the 3"", 6 for the other 3"" and like 10-12 for my whoop"
How often do tinywhoop batteries degrade enough to have to be replaced?,"idk I still use the ones I got for xmas. but I killed one or two from my bad charging habits I have one that I’m scared to use…. Then 9 I got in may. So technically 10 batteries, got like 5 months ago. I think I’m seeing slight degradation over time, but not too much to not fly so what charger to buy for 6s the M7 is pretty good, you do need a PSU for it though. the Hota T6 is also interesting"
hota t6 hmm. this also needs a power supply?,"yes but it can be powered from USB PD The Hota H6 has a built in PSU if you have a high power phone PSU, that's good There's this boy selling an m7 for 30 quid so i'll see if he still has it"
Is this screw to short for this motor?,I think it is. I think it is
"How long should it be, the same size as the blue thing it should gone up in?",You want the screw to engage all of the available threads without penetrating the stator coils. So another mm or two longer would be good
why do some motors have cw and ccw versions?,"That's an old practice. Once upon a time, we didn't use nylock nuts on everything, so some motors came with reverse-threaded prop shafts Once we all realized that nylock is amazing, everything went back to standard CW threads Nylock + steel shafts. alu shafts however.... *yeah that's dogpoo anyway*"
whats the difference? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/volador-vx3-o3-freestyle-frame-kit-flyfishrc-11330.html#/10112-color-tropical https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/volador-vx35-o3-freestyle-frame-kit-flyfishrc-11331.html#/10112-color-tropical,"3"" vs 3.5"" props (so arm length)"
ty. can i ask one more question?,"No you aren't allowed to, you reached your maximum number of questions, it will be 25¢ per messages now okay. whats your paypal bad for you i wont pay then"
what frame should i pick? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/micro-apex-3-frame-kit-7532.html https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/volador-vx3-o3-freestyle-frame-kit-flyfishrc-11330.html#/10112-color-tropical,I would pick the volador
can you tell me why?. or its just common sense?,Because basically everyone who got it loves it (except people who don't understand how screws work) Because it's awesome. And the micro apex doesn't support aios. Which is a big bummer
"I've got some LEDs (ws2812b) connected to my speedybee f405 v4 led pads, I can control brightness and on and off but that's all. I can't adjust colour or mode. help? it just lights up green","Aios are great on micros, saves a bit of weight and you don't even loose much durability at those sizes yeah i getting the volador I have a vx3.5. From a tuning/noise standpoint it's well crafted, it's pleasant to work on with some nice little design tweaks to make it all neat.  10/10. Will buy again when/if I break this one."
Are the skyzone cobra x goggles the best analog box goggles?,"Yes, and they are also the best value goggle Alright, just wanted to make sure (if you don't want exclusively box goggles there is better, for a hefty premium, but in the analog box goggles world they are the best) i alreadyu bought them so im excited Only analog goggle worth buying now. Unless you're going balls deep into analog for a specific reason, Walksnail is an objectively better choice. yea i prefer box goggles, i got the dominator v3's I dont like how small the screens are The fov isn't dependant on the goggles type I fly so much better with the ev800d that I have You have slim goggles with 50° fpv too. Agreed Like looking at a phone screen at the other end of a long hallway. :nauseated_face: O4x pros to name only one. Yet according to orqa for their race goggles that's a feature well I guess ill be giving slim goggles another try in the future"
do i need to change any parts?,I would have to get prescription inserts for them too witch is a pain in the ass Yeah it's just that the dominator v3 are garbage. Some 3016 props and a much smaller vtx. And a stack/aio -# How dare you speak lies… or how on earth do you like box goggles… I hate mine I think If I had better eyesight they would of been more enjoyable to use No they are just garbage. Also you need a receiver
what ones do you have? :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:,im asking what do i need to raplace wdymm they are baller
Virtual Retinal Display FPV headsets when?,"i have them too, I fly so well with them They are heavy AF in the front yea thats why im getting the cobra x goggles. they are a lot smaller That guy would be a good replacement, it is litteraly just a rushtank mini with a different shell https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/ft800-vtx-by-t-motor-10035.html. Cause lighter. And 3"" is small and they make you look goofy as hell every goggle will make you look goofy True but the ev800d are the goofiest Yeah, they extend a meter Infront of you I wonder how much torque my EV800D apply on my face… they are very front heavy the whole thing is like 300grams bro, go to gym I’m not going to the gym for my neck..: I’m stealing that lol"
guys what is packet rate on elrs radios?. i have it on 250hz-108d rn,sends your inputs 250x per second. more = smoother less = better range
Do i get any benefit from turning it up?. aah okay. is what I have it set as a good medium?,"its fine, most ppl will probably not notice a difference between 250, 500, 1000"
can i send a 25 minute video of me doing a live showing liftoff and can someone tell me what should i work on?. i dont have any other footage,"Not really smoother, but lower latency Yeah but you can't really feel the extra smoothness, but you could feel the lower latency No that's illegal, the bribe will cost 25$ dang it. its gonna be without sound because the sound quality is doodoo. yeah and its 480p. :Harold: then 25$ isn't enough. make an edit with your best attempts and maby someone will watch that"
why do i need to buy a 1$ software to read the file?. wtf windows?. what do i do now?,"Or else you could just scour the net and download one that isn't 1$. You send it on YouTube, then wait nah ill just download it in capcut how do people still not have vlc. come on Because it's not baked into windows yet capcut doesnt want to download a tiktok live video thats new"
1: Install Windows 2: Use Edge to download and install Firefox 3: Use Firefox to download everything else (including VLC). Did anyone else ever use Ninite for that?,"and then you get to regedit all the garbage that Windows has now away or the alternative path: overwrite Windows with a better OS :face_with_tongue: i dont have edge i deleted it in cmd funny because you can't fully delete it. ever yeah i deleted it. fr. its not there I mean, the smarter step 2 would be to have pre-loaded firefox installer on a thumbdrive Brave is literally Google Chrome but with added homophobia. it isn't better in any way Their logo looks nicer Brave uses Chromium, which I am allergic to"
Also since when do they have homophobia ?,"the CEO is a douchebag and they've even been caught inserting sketchy shit into brave Why do every nice thing have a shit CEO. Well I'm just going to ignore this reality because I am just too used to it Turns out the prerequisites for becoming a CEO also has a large overlap with being a horrible person opera gx is worse. its facts. its actual spyware See, this is why I stick with Firefox yes the browser no one has used for 5 years is spyware. no kidding Honestly I thought Opera died in the naughts Awful people makes for great fear managers They did fully die, but then it basically became a whole new company and then they just took the Opera name and put it on top of Chromium There is still a surprising amount of people on ytb being sponsored by them too im gonna send the clip tomorrow so you don't even use sponsorblock I use an adblock and the ""l"" key to fast forward thought it. Works just fine"
what is sponsorblock?,"it blocks sponsors. lol https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone It literally auto skips sections of youtube videos that are sponsored <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dearrow-better-titles-and/enamippconapkdmgfgjchkhakpfinmaj> it skips the video to a certain point or what. oh okay https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/consent-o-matic/mdjildafknihdffpkfmmpnpoiajfjnjd. there you go. all 3 what do i need that for To tell every website you go on that you do not want 83,614,187 additional cookies because cookies cause diabetes  and it saves you ~0.75 seconds from having to do it yourself i mean it kind of says. in the discord embed"
do you need it in a different format?,it has mp4 but i only can use it in vlc. explain the question in dummy terms. oh. okay
Hi Anyone knows if there is posible to use DJI SDK to work with mini 4 pro?,Stick tension is entirely a matter of personal preference bca at offcial page there is no support for this model You say that but it literally falls back down when I set the radio vertically. I love a smooth throttle So add some lithium grease to the mechanism inside the radio to smooth out the movement without sacrificing tension I'm going to order 5 gallons of it then.
"my meteor65s motors arent working anymore since i tried to ramp up the initial motor boost when arming because one motor didnt always start, what can i do?","wiggle the motor wire and connector, or swap motors to check if it still works only real solution is direct soldering it to the FC"
Does it just not spin anymore at all ? Or does it jitter ? (Even if it's just a tiny bit),"they jump up for a moment and then stop If he smoked an esc, direct soldering to the aio will not change anything https://github.com/bird-sanctuary/bluejay/wiki/Setup Try to swap two of the motors Unplug one of the working motors, and swap the one that doesn't spin with it. Then if the bottom left esc spins, it was just a crapped motor. If it doesn't spin with the new motor but the motor that used to be at the bottom left does spin on the other esc then you either have a smoked esc or bad esc settings i think its esc settings because i just flashed something on it and now it doesnt work. the drone worked before. and i just dont know what to flash now bluejay. tried multiple versions now Then go flash it again, don't touch the first bubbles, it will fill itself, just select version 0.21 and 48khz. So you know you have it flashed right, then send a screenshot of your bluejay settings"
flash this?. just making sure,"If you didn't touch the ""esc"" bubble, then yeah okay. esc-configurator.com That's just their color way okay new issue. the motors vibrate very slightly and after a second or so they all play three notes ""dee doo doo"" and stop"
will i feel a difference between 3s and 4s?,"Send a screenshot of your bluejay settings both quads will be 3"" Well, it will have 30% more power power. If the kv is the same. If you adjust it (which you should) then it depends. But since you can use higher relative kv with higher voltage (cause higher voltage means more efficiency) you will get more power Follow this  https://github.com/bird-sanctuary/bluejay/wiki/Setup 3s motors are 1104 4300kv and 4s motors will be 1404 4600kv That is a dumb size and kv for 3s 3"" i think i know the issue But that other motor would work pretty well for 4s with slightly lower pitch props the one motor doesnt start spinning so the esc applies more power, till the preset limit is reached. so basically my motor aint starting Cause 4600kv is fairly high, but would work well with like a 3016 props for example i have 3016 props in my shopping cart rn Ok. In that same article they tell you how to fix it, so just follow it Only gemfan makes a 3016 prop oh. thats why. ty for helping wait i think i just now have to reverse motor directions"
Are Radiomaster (Boxer) controllers known to work in Steam on Linux?,"all motors run but not in the right direction That doesn't change anything to the motor not spinning, but yeah they all need to spin in the right direction for the motor direction you use in betaflight"
so i gotta go to betaflight?. or where do i do that,"The boxer does work in simulators if that's what you are wondering its not a steam specific thing afaik, its just, does it have linux drivers and does it appear in the game Yeah I successfully tested it on Windows, but I prefer Linux Go on betaflight->motor tab check motor direction (props in or props out) then go back into esc configurator and change esc direction accordingly"
"if the specific game recognizes it, it should work? i would imagine linux has the right drivers for it but i dont actually use linux myself @arsCynic","It does recognize it ingame, just the calibration isn't doing what it is supposed to. I'll tinker a bit more, thank you hm strange. i bet it will work edventually. good luck yeah of course. it's just a HID device. works fine for me I'm using FPV.SkyDive"
"Hey, i lost the bolt on my motor and i replaced it with a smaller one, which makes it uneven on 1 of the motors. Would this affect my flight performance in any way?","Im planning on getting a corba x v2 , will I be able to use a battery pack (using C) without getting a 18650. Or even use it with an outlet how does a bolt make it uneven"
You can see the difference no?. The red prop has a smaller bolt,"thats a nut :PepeBigHmm: :double_exclamation_mark:. Mybad yeh doesnt matter may wiggle loose if it has no nylock insert that should be ok, but make sure it is plenty plenty tight as its not a nylock. i would order a replacement yup, just make sure it's in the correct voltage range and it comes with an xt60 adapter Those nuts were $5 for a bag of 10. I would rather my drone loose a motor then get scammed like that"
holy. damn. are you in the US?,can get 25pcs for 1.10€ from aliexpress lol ^. im sure you can find nylocks somewhere The drone flys completely fine to be fair but i would just be worried that itd cut out when im flying through buildings
https://rotorriot.com/products/m5-nylock-prop-nuts?srsltid=AfmBOoortqCtKThkJgP9hcsFpiHDYIke4pQOE48J8vZH4ocViBMcHSsM these are 70c a piece so kinda expensive but its rotoriot and its pick a color. i lied its black. but you get the idea,Hmm ok ill have a look at ali express and this too. Better safe than sorry if its tight it should be fine. hitting something with the prop may be more likely to loosen it. imo biggest problem is its just a pain being so small and maybe depressing the hex into the motor Yea thats what i was worried about
do you know whats the weight difference?,"you can figure it out, the weight is in the product description of the two"
what do i need to fly 3d ?,a quad. and enabling it in betaflight assuming your esc firmware supports it
do every hardware support 3d ?,https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/3D-Setup thanks :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
is 18g still too heavy?,"it's still pretty heavy, I would really recommend you stick with the one I linked or go with a nano vtx like the tbs unify pro nano32 v1.1 or happymodel ovx300 okay. im asking so much because i want to pack this drone with the most sht possible even if its useless. i have no idea why. i just want it to be a huge upgrade from the babyape yeah but since it's a micro, it will fly a lot better if it's lighter. and just taking a 5"" and swapping the frame will make it fly like a hot potato"
oh okay. im gonna stick to the vtx you sugested then. is it safe to mount a receiver with double sided tape?,"yes, that's how I do it on all my builds"
oh okay. will a caddx ant fit in the volador frame or do i need a bigger camera?,it will fit with a tpu adapter. but i'm not a big fan of that camera honestly
so i should get a bigger one?,"im pretty sure all modern blheli escs will support it. you need to make sure your throttle stick centers, and *preferably* you get 3d props but you dont actually need them from what i understand I would get a baby ratel 2 okay im gonna get that one then good to know i troth i needed 3d props"
"it will fit without any adapters, right?","you should go look at youtube comparisons, camera is heavily taste based. it's also a 14mm camera, so it would also need spacers oh. well i think i dont want to use a adapter yeah you can run without them, but normal props wont be as efficient or powerful in reverse"
what size should the camera be to fit perfectly?,"you would need a 19mm/micro camera, but you should just use a 14mm camera and spacers imo"
can you tell me a reason?,"14mm cameras will be quite a bit lighter, and imo, the image quality isn't that different if you get good ones (but again, youtube comparisons are here so you make your mind, we don't have the same eyes)"
is there a specific video i should watch?,"I would watch nick burn's videos if he made some on the camera you are looking for, since he used the orqa and batch 1 hdz goggles since a while now, so he can give you basically the best dvr you can get I hate that it’s genuinely important to know if analog footage was recorded on a Fat Shark DVR or not. Because it sucks so much"
Do you have a 3d printer ?,"Great, just ask them to print a 19mm to 14mm spacer. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5540993"
does it need supports?,not if you print it flat
okay. the one on the top?,"yeah. the others would probably work too One simply has to disable Steam Input. I think it was on by default and it messed up the inputs. Now it works just fine, thanks. lmao go figure. good to see it works"
what is this bottom part for. beeper?,or receiver or whatever you want to add in there
"Guys I have an esc with only a battery cable soldered to it, nothing on the motor pads. Can I power it up with a battery test it or will that cause problems?",Cheers bro. Bent a connector pin so wanna see what's what before moving forward
You mean it says 14.4V on the side or it's actually sitting at 14.4V right now?,"no the pack is dead dead, but yes its a 12 cell 14.4 v nimh batt pack If you have a smart lipo charger, it should have a NIMH mode"
is there anything else i need to do besides leave it at 0.1a for however long?. i think ill just put the pack to nominal and see if it holds it,Pretty much this. Just let it slow charge for a long time
"the walksnail moonlight says it can handle 25.2v (normal full charged 6s) but my batteries can charge up to 4.35v per cell (26.1v), im assuming i should *not* charge to 4.35v? or will it be fine","its only a 1v difference so it should be negligible, but honestly you may want to just contact walksnail/caddx with that question You shouldn't be running a VTX directly off of VBAT anyway. Especially not if you're going to be that close to the stated voltage limit Well I accidentally fucked the 9v pad last night. Long story short, shitty capacitor mount, leg snapped, shorted the fc, was very lucky to only kill the 9v pad. Rn my cap is mounted at the connector (better than nothing) and I have more caps on the way so I can properly mount it to the batt pads then NIMH aren't as catastrophic as lipos when they fail, but still quite capable of starting a fire. You'll likely see smoke first, as the cells rupture, but a good way to catch it early is to monitor the temperature of the pack. If it starts to get *really* warm, that's cause for concern"
"noted. my hota d6 charger ended up saying charge done thinking its a 2 cell nimh, any idea how to override cell count detection?. or do i need to go back to bench mode and just leave it at 5v. til it reaches 5v then go to 6 and so on",Yea you can use bench supply mode to get it up to ~12V
is it safe to put that much voltage in?. it has an option for 14.4,"You need to get it up to where the charger will see it as a 12S NIMH pack ah. ima be honest this is a pack for the original roomba from 2002 lol. so im more just curious if this pack can actually power the roomba Should I only charge my packs to like 25v or something atleast until I can fix my 9v pad or even a new fc it was literally at 0.00v, i now have 2.6 v and it holds so Back in the day I remember doing what I always heard referred to as a ""soak"" charge. Basically you'd leave a multi-cell NIMH pack on the charger at 0.1A for like a day. That re-balances everything and gets all the cells stabilized @DædalusFPV  is saying the voltage jumps while flying may bump it higher than that, and fry the vtx, so 25v may not be okay either. wish me luck"
Do you have a new/good capacitor on there?,"ill have my hand on it and watch the temp mainly, and only do 0.1a :thumbs_up: it's normaly for a NIMH to get a little warm anyway while charging. Just be wary of concerning heat build-up There is a new 35v 470uf(I think) cap on the xt30 lead. Came with the stack"
"i got a spark cuz the contact had 12v at it, i got spooked lol.... are we sure a fully dead nimh pack at like 3 v wont explode if given 12v 0.1a?","I'm fairly sure, but it has been quite a while since I worked with NIMH. It's functionally the same for you to step the voltage up manually from 3V-12V i cant have it connected and give it 12v cuz it says to not connect the batt, like if it sees voltage it wont let me start the bench mode. i may do tht just to be safer ish"
where are the vtx mounting holes placed in the volador frame?,"looks like im current limited which is good, i have it set to 12v 0.1a and its at 5.57v, will watch it as it SHOULD just go up to 12v over time as resistance lowers and voltage increases in the pack You're *probably* fine to charge your lipos to 4.2V/cell, but I wouldn't go above that until you can get the VTX on a separate regulator again https://www.getfpv.com/mateksys-micro-bec-6-60v-to-5v-9v-12v.html would this work Yea it would, I love these little things. At 24V input it will do up to 2A on 12V output, so that'll be enough for your VTX"
"Another thing to squeeze in this compact ass frame. I still need to find a good spot for my buzzer. I’d wire the batt pad to input with a ground, then connect vtx to the bec as normal?",Ok. I’ll get some on the way then
"I have tried calibrating my zorro, but there is still a  slight drift to roll. how to fix it?","I mean, I'd recommend trim switches only if you know exactly why the roll is happening and have tried every other avenue to fix it properly trim switches are for temporary adjustments.  Permanent adjustments should be done in subtrims. @DædalusFPV  at the current rate its going, my nimh battery will take 34 hours to hit 12v lol.... might bump it up to 0.3a lol. MIGHT, for now ill leave it. its 4min per 0.01v and the charger says its doing 6.88v Better that it takes a little longer and you end up with a healthy useable pack, IMO nimh voltage curves are completely weird i need to sleep tho and i dont trust this jank ass setup without my eyes being ON IT then unplug it and charge it the rest of the way tomorrow I mean the trim not being centered being the cause of the problem. Should've specified ah, in that case yeah, check the trim switches 6.89v! WOOOO. give it up for day 23! lol"
umm. went for the maiden flight in my room and one corner keeps launching a prop off. its just a 1.5mm shaft mount. any ideas?,"At the rear (you can of course put the vtx at the middle, but idk why you would) When i arm up my quad i dont see osd ... It just disappear :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: can you show a screenshot of your BF Modes tab (with hide unused ticked)"
Do dji v2 goggles come with a battery?,its not a threaded mount There are 3 holes in the prop The 2 outside ones are to screw it on with m2 screws i see whjat you mean. LOL The one in the middle is for the shaft It would have been impressive if it did hold on without the screws
should i startup motors in betaflight and look on my goggles?,Use the Motors tab to spin up the motors (without props).  See in the goggles if the OSD disappears. no it doesnt disappear. it only disappear when i arm quad
arming the quad spins up the motors. so I'm checking if it's the motor spin that's directly responsible. What video system do you use?  Should've started with that xD,"its cinelog 35 v2 (vtx geprc rad 1w / fc geprc 45a aio f722) @wendaty spin up the motors in BF motors tab, to a good amount of throttle and then slow down the motors one by one with your fingers. and see if the OSD disappears"
"Is this really bad, or can it work?. (the red wire)",Yikes. Apply heat until it all flows together and covers the pad
What tip are you using?,That's the iron. What *tip* are you using
Can I send a image on it? I do not really know the name,"It should be printed on the side of the tip, but yea you can send a pic That's not the worst one you could use... (though there are better ones). hm The one that was included It would be a PITA to solder the ground tho"
What solder are you using? @wilmer. yeahhhhh. that's not going to go well. lead free needs a shitload of heat and flux to work right. Ideally I would recommend leaded 63/37 from a reputable source,"Maybe rosin core too so it has some flux already But just to get through this particular joint, go to 400C, add flux, tin the tip, and then just.... hodl"
Are the walksnail goggles L any good?,"crank the temperature and pray it works or buy solder that's not garbage @wilmer Yeh, but not in grass etc"
"If I crank the temperature, do that gonna damage something?","You're at a higher risk of ruining the tip of the iron or burning a pad on the board. It doesn't mean that it will certainly happen, just that the risk is higher. I usually solder at around 380°C cause I'm impatient. but that's with leaded My favorite thing to do with leaded solder tho isn’t soldering. It makes a great snack I..... may have done that as a kid..... >.>"
"And you’re still alive, so what does that tell you? It’s healthy.","Looks better. The ground is gonna be like 5x harder tho you may be skipping one important step. tin the pad. tin the wire. then solder them together. saying cause the + pad isn't fully covered in solder Yes, flood the pad first"
So should I just remove it again?,"nah. it's good enough, but you may have made it more difficult for yourself"
Future in the process or what do you mean?,"I mean that you made the soldering more difficult by not tinning the pad first. so for the other pad, make sure to tin it first I did, but might did add some paste and then tin… the whole pad should have a nice shallow dome of solder on it. edge to edge"
Like this? (Left side),"Looks like a JST, but which one idk it looks a bit cold. but with unleaded that may be the best you'll get on the GND pad basically yes, but it should be a shiny ball. otherwise you're running way too cold. crank it up to 450 but only stay on the pad for ~2 seconds and see if it all melts The TS101 can't go that high iirc"
does the volador frame come with screws?,"even the tiny pads with the cap don't look wetted. oh @TS101. in that case just go to max the tip needs to be shiny, too. add a little dab of solder on it to before touching the pad/wire to help with heat transfer It will come with screws for its own construction. Beyond that there are no guarantees"
okay. will these spacers work with the screws from the kit? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/2mm-anodized-stack-spacers-10pcs-5538.html#/3515-color-turquoise,"Inner thread on those spacers is 3mm, so as long as the frame screws are also M3 screws (3mm), they'll work. If not, they won't"
"ty. the vtx should come with its connector, right?",yeah. cable+connector Yes it will come with its own wiring harness yeah thats what i meant. sorry for the misunderstanding
do people buy additional screws for their builds?,I always keep assorted sets of various screws. IME it is not uncommon to need to swap screw lenghts for one part or another. Or to need extras anyway. Last set of motors I ordered did not come with screws of an appropriate length. So there went 16 screws out of my kit
i think im just gonna pray that there will be enough screws. whats a keystone?,"In the context of Flyfish frames, it's a small block of carbon fiber that wedges the arms in place during assembly to reduce vibration"
okay. can i put a aio in a stack mount? if that makes any sense,"Yea you can, probably need a mount adapter"
"the specs of the frame say ""stack mounting holes"". does this make any difference if its a stack or a aio?","it's the bolt pattern. 20x20 and 30x30 are the usual sizes for a stack, and 25x25 is the usual pattern for an AIO. of course you can make an adapter that connects 20x20 to 25x25 Stack mounting holes: 20mm 20mm/25.5mm 25.5mm. it should work with a aio then ok so you can put a 20x20 stack or a 25x25 AIO on. yeah"
what does c mean?. and how do i calculate this value?,"No adapter needed assuming both batteries have XT60 That’s not that much over normal So what, you charged at about 1.8C that's not gonna destroy it.. Actually most packs can be _relatively_ safely charged up to 2C The best description of C I can give is ""fraction of an hour"" Charging/discharging at 1C should in theory take 1 hour at 2C it should in theory take 1/2 hour etc  If you have a 1500mAh battery 1500mAh = 1.5Ah  1.5Ah * 1C = 1.5A 1.5Ah * 2C = 3.0A  etc  Basically, you take the capacity of the battery, not in mAh but Ah, and multiply it by the intended C rate.. So for a 380mAh battery 380mAh = 0.38Ah So 1C is 0.38A round up to nearest so 0.4A and what does ah mean :Harold:"
you have a 380mAh battery from what I read. do you not understand what the 380mAh means?,"it's the capacity of the battery mAh is milliamps/hours, it's the capacity, it's a thousands of an ah, an amp/hour Ah = amp-hour a 1Ah battery can deliver 1 Amp of current for 1 hour. the m is just milli. same as millimeters vs meters these are like. very very pre-requisite things. that you should've known before getting into the hobby. https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/. have a read Don't confuse the C rating that's written on the battery with the charging C rate. btw. the C rating that's written on the battery is discharge. you can discharge lipos much faster than you can charge them. 1C is the standard charging rate. 1C is ultra simple take the capacity (380mAh) convert it to Ah (0.38Ah) ignore the h (0.38A) round up to tenths (0.4A) => 0.4A is your charging current"
i mean.. idk about walksnail.. but have you tried connecting that to a monitor?. oh i actually found a video just now  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uSrtffvU8c>,"it literally has a hdmi out. or you can use the caddx app on your android phone I have an iphone and it doesn’t work for me unfortunately for li-ion, the standard charging rate is 0.5C (half of what lipo use) unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer if you have a two-sided hdmi cable, you can just connect it to any monitor tbh seems to be the trend for anything not mainstream with iPhones and for figuring out the charging current, the cell count is irrelevant. Only the Ah capacity matters. i mean.. most small apps arent developed for ios cause compiling to IOS is a pain in the ass for the devs"
"If i want to connect it to my laptop for example, do i need to download a specific app?",hmm im not sure about a laptop.. it might show up as a second screen in your display settings
So for a 1500mah 6s battery and a 1500mah 4s battery the c rating is the same?. So i just need to buy a small monitor?,"yeahh. with an hdmi in port For charging, the C rules work the same for both of them.. At least as far as high power batteries are concerned no that's not really the reason at all compiling for IOS = not that big of a deal dealing with Apple's ridiculous rules = big deal"
"So if i have a 4s 4000mah lion battery, the standard c rating for charging is 1c? (4a)","As I said, for Li-Ion, the default is 0.5C, not 1C. unless you know that your cells are rated for 1C"
Oh sorry. So 2a right?,"yeah. most of the modern higher current cells are capable of 1C charging. but not all. so check the specs Apple charges like a 100 dollars just to get the chance to be on the App Store, on top of that they don't really easily allow free Bluetooth access without a strict set of rules and getting your app judged every time you make an update takes weeks. All these rando apps by Caddx and stuff are made with cross-platform stuff. > Apple charges like a 100 dollars just to get the chance to be on the App Store okay honestly that rule I don't mind that much as it's an easy filter for generated crapware i know, but they get to place random charges whenever they want lol with that I agree lol I wouldn't be surprised if it is also harder for a company in China to get something into the App Store here"

fpv montor or just a little screen?,"Just a little screen, i have a hdmi port in my googles"
cos most have hdmi in not out. got a preference where you buy from?,"Not really. Just want it to be good it is mini hdmi by the way. it needs to accept 1080p 100fps as a signal, or at least 60fps"

How many inches do you Think i should get?,"idk. 5-10"" is my guess"
Hi I have a pair of skyzone 02o goggles and they don't fit me vary well the main issue is the nose portion of the goggles is to small and puts a ton of pressure on my nose. I have looked around for foam cushons to replace the stock ones and cant find any. are there any out there our is there any other way to fix this? or i was thinking would it be possible to make custom foam insert things?,"not 1080 and also one of those is a touchscreen also not 1080p but should work regardless The faceplate for all of Skyzone's binocular goggles is the same, so you should be able to get foam listed for one that's compatible"
Is it that important that the screen will be able to run 1920x1080p?,according to @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) the goggles x will directly output whatever you have your settings set to in the goggles. so if you have it set to 1080p 100fps. it will output ONLY 1080p and 100fps. it will not adapt the signal for the screen or for the tv

Does this mean its a controlled airspace or no?. can I fly in this airspace?,@DædalusFPV 7.2v 9 hours lol
"So that means I can't fly my drone?. I'm just trying to understand this restriction rules. Because it says you can fly drones in Virignia, but I'm not sure which areas are yes, and no","Absolutely unequivocally no. Washington DC is under permanent flight restriction, no uas may be operated in the SFRA If you are inside the restricted area, you cannot fly it. There are apps you can download to show you the restricted airspaces on a map. Personally I like air aware and airhub portal"
"Ok I'll use that to double check. Cuz theres no way I can't fly a drone at all, anywhere in my area, right?","DC is one of the most heavily restricted airspaces in the country. Even most GA aircraft can't fly into DC (it's complicated). https://www.faa.gov/uas/resources/community_engagement/no_drone_zone/dc Mine weighs just 249 grams, and I'd just fly it in a neighborhood in an open clear field, under 400ft ofc. So it says its fine Looks like you might be OK then. Just be careful not to accidentally fly into the frz"
I see this airspace is devided into 2 circles?. I'm barley inside the second one. Is the second one the no fly zone at all?,"Correct, at least, not without authorization (which is *very unlikely*)"
why is that area like that?,It's the USA's capitol city The USA is the most defense-paranoid country on Earth
wackyyy. Aren't there bigger cities in the US with less restrictions too?,"Yes but those cities aren't the seat of our entire government. If a nuke takes out LA, we just lose a lot of people and a naval base. If a nuke takes out DC, we lose the head of every government function for the entire country wild. yeah not so much a worry in the Netherlands. a nuke and it's all gone. lol. including the ones stored for the US smh The NFZ around DC wasn't established until after 9/11. We weren't worried back then. But after the 9/11 attack... we kind of lost it a little. I'm not saying the NFZ isn't warranted, I'm not in a position to judge. But as a country we are so damned paranoid now it's scary, even from the inside"
Are there actual air protection systems in place?,"Unauthorized aircraft are literally met with military jet intercepts. They fly sorties all the time I've seen the US from about every perspective possible at this point I'm pretty sure they track every bird within 100 miles of DC jets on standby is pretty crazy Yea I mean, people are redirected all the time without the F-16s rolling, but it is definitely not unheard of. I am very close to an individual that is a corporate pilot, they've been flying in and out of the east coast a lot lately, and the amount of overhead is nuts just flying *near* DC"

"I need help with everything related to charging Li-ion batteries.  When it comes to charging LiPo batteries, everything is fine. I can charge my batteries between 1C-5C (I usually charge them at 1.5C to make them live longer), and within an hour, I have 4 batteries ready to fly (I charge two at a time).  But with Li-ion batteries, i meed to wait hours for them to charge (maybe I’m not understanding something correctly).  I have two Li-ion batteries: 1. 4S 4000mAh 21700 battery for my goggles - max charging is 1C 2. 2S 5000mAh for an external battery for my Zorro - max charging is 2A  I know that I can use them down to 3.0V per cell, charge them up to 4.2V, and store them at 3.7V.  So, for every flight where I want to use these batteries, I need to charge them to 4.0V per cell for example (to save time), then after i finished with them charge them back to 3.8V after the flight, and for the next flight, charge them again to 4.0v? It seems crazy to me that i need to wait so long to charge only 2 Li-ion batteries every time i want to fly.. Sorry for making it too long, i want it to be as detailed as possible","@MadMax @GaLfield_33  Airmode is turned on by default in Betaflight because it keeps the drone controllable even at low throttle.  Without it, at low throttle, the drone behaves as if it was drunk (at least when falling through air).  Betaflight has two ways of controlling airmode:  1) Configuration tab.  Turning airmode ON here (which it is by default) enables it permanently, and removes it from Modes tab.   2) Modes tab If Airmode is OFF in Configuration tab, it can be assigned to a switch via Modes tab. Hello. Is there a way to mirror PC screen to DJI goggles 2 Batteries take long to charge. Nothing new to see here.. At 1C, a battery takes around 1 hour to charge (from empty). Balancing and the slowdown near the end will prolong it a bit.. The answer isn't faster charging, the answer is more batteries.. Also, for Li-Ions specifically, they aren't anywhere near as sensitive to storing charged. compared to lipos. You could definitely just store them at 4.0V without any significant adverse effects (For disclaimer:  ‏I'm sending this message to a few other FPV Discord servers, not to get a quicker answer but to get multiple opinions/advice on what I wrote to help me form my own opinion on it ( *that's going to blow over like a lead balloon*. :KEKw:"
It wont damage them for the long run?,Just in case someone tells you to charge li-ions faster than manufacturer stated limit:  Bad idea.
How to  mirror pc screen on dji goggles 2?,"li-ions should handle storage charge mistreatment about as well as your phone's battery @GaLfield_33 Get a DJI cam and VTX, point the cam at your computer screen, and voila, PC mirrored to goggles If i will treat them like im treating my phone battery they are going to die in 2 days:grinning_face_with_sweat: *okay maybe not THAT badly*. but you get the point As for the rest, my answer still stands.. the solution is more batteries I agree with GG, you don't need to obsess over li-ion storage charging nearly as much as with lipo. I normally leave mine anywhere from 3.4-4.0 per cell unless I'm storing them *long* term. For *long* term storage I go off of whatever the cell's datasheet says the nominal voltage is (3.6V in the case of my packs) I usually go for 0.1V above nominal. but like, minimal difference The rated voltage of a cell. lipos are 3.7V. lihv are 3.8V. it's basically the average voltage through a discharge cycle. with a lipo cell, if you go from full (4.2) to empty (3.2) under a low constant load, measure the voltage at regular intervals, and then average it out, you'll end up with 3.7V"
what filament should i use?,"Tpu would be ideal, pla will work too, realistically almost anything will work for a camera spacer"

ty. whats the difference between destilled water and iso alc?,"One is water that has been distilled, the other is isopropyl alcohol. It's like asking the difference between a banana and a cupcake"
"they both get rid of salt and minerals from water, right?","Most iso alcohol you buy in a store is at least partially water anyway, but most minerals that dissolve easily in water will dissolve easily into *any* pH-neutral liquid. So, in short, yes"
I assume based on where we're at that you're talking about cleaning electronics?,I would always use the purest IsoA you can find. It flashes off super quickly so the electronics are left dry almost immediately after application I have dumped isopropyl 91% on stuff after I spilled a drink.. Surprised my tx16s works.

Figure you need to go around the whole thing, then add 50%"
no. im gonna buy gn3 4s 850mah. im not sure if i dont neef a new cable for connecting the battery too. i was going to use the one from the babyape but its super thin so idk. is using 2 battery straps a good idea or 1 is enough?,"For a 4S 3"" I like to use XT30 with good quality 16AWG wire. 1 is plenty, especially if you pair it with some Ummagrip or similar"
what do i do with the grip from the volador frame?,"I have no idea how good it is, but most of the ""grippy"" battery pads I've seen that come with frames are not grippy at all, and in fact are barely non-slip"
is ummagrip lite good?. or the normal one is just better?. ah nevermind. i wanted the grip to match the colors of the build but i realised that black is better. is there a way to check if a drone is waterproof without risking damage or i just need to wait for it to happen on its own?,I've never tried it tbh. If the electronics are already conformal coated everything on the PCB and components should appear shiny
Guys? Is BetaFPV F4 A5 1S Flight controller good FC?,"It's *fine* but I wouldn't recommend it I want it bc I can't solder. Found a lot of negative reviews on amazon betafpv's page like dead out of the box or trash gyro There's no time like the present to learn how to solder. It's an essential skill in FPV.. Motor plugs only add weight and decrease performance. But like I said, it's *fine* I still have to solder the camera And probably the battery lead It has already soldered BT2.0.

"In which way should I have the stuff that should be in between my esc and flight controller?

Set the rate type to ""Actual"" and the numbers make more sense.. I've settled on 60, 600, 0.6 across the board after spending months messing around with my rates. They need to be spaced out enough (on the screws) that they don't hit each other when subjected to shocks/vibrations.. No stiff sections (soldered/tinned) of wiring should touch anything else either.. (How to clean build 101).

what do i do if i have mmcx?. can i desolder it?,"I would suggest breathing… that’s something everyone should do Well even if you didn’t have it, breathing is smth you should still do"
you really want to go full waterproof?,i mean i guess you might have to do the mmcx connector too then
what about ufl?. i have one too on the receiver?. i want to go full cheeseburgerballs waterproof,"okay. i didnt even know that its possible to desolder connectors Of course it is, that's how they got there in the first place Interesting dolphins have to remember to breathe Pft- imagine breathing Must be fully conscious"
"With the analog radiomaster boxer edgetx, do I need to do any additional setup other than binding the controller a bnf drone?

Is Rush Tank Solo has 20x20mm M2 mount? What length screws should I use (for mounting on Volador VX3.5)?,"I wouldn't put the Solo in a 3.5"" quad at all tbh"
It's a 1W VTX. and it's also quite similarly priced to most bigger size VTX. or is there an updated one?. either way it's priced 50 dollars like all the other VTX also are,"Yeah, the solo isn't that big or heavy, it would work fine on a 3.5"". Some m2x4 or slightly longer would work since the vx3.5's mid plate is 2.5mm, but you can also just use double sided vhb tape if you don't have those screws on hand, it works really well If you need 1.6W of analog on a micro build you're doing something wrong Why wouldn't I want 1w of analog if it fits in the frame and isn't too heavy either, it's just a nice to have Solo is $65, Mini is $44. And even the mini is kinda overkill imo Not everyone can live with only 300mw I don't know what kind of flying you're doing but 800mW is the bare minimum I need. even on a system like Walksnail 400mW should go far enough anywhere you'd fly a micro again... what kind of flying are you doing It is very much a miniquad https://tenor.com/view/suicide-kms-gif-4481206. I fly in parks, around our house and large backyard, fields and forests I fly around the house, in parks, from within the car, big ol parking lots, foresty areas. I would not be able to go as far or even some places at all with less than 800mW. I don't know how close you fly or with how many obstructions or interference"
"You'd consider this a miniquad? In the same class as 5""?","I also fly around my house (where the 200mw of the hdzero whoop vtx is enough) but when I go to the field I need 1w to go where I want. Yeah, to me a micro is 3"" and under. And 3.5"" is when miniquad begins"
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/645118110663442432.webp?size=48,"also we're talking about this chonker. not a little toothpick hybrid It's just size. Micro refers to size, nothing to do with weight yes i am not the dumb A 3"" cinewhoop can weigh as much as a 5"" and it'd be a micro quad. 4"" and below is micro. 5-6"" is mini, 7""+ is macro (some might consider 7"" mini too if they fly much much larger stuff) you can't try to make factual categories and then throw in that there's still opinions attached Well, now that we entered in the realm of semantics we are never going to agree, and we are kind of straying from the original discussion 25mW of analog should go 1km with decent equipment With a high gain directional and no obstruction, but who cares about that when you fly freestyle with stuff in-between you and the quad With a decent patch even. No need for super high gain stuff A patch is a directional, and high gain isn't necessary a 21dbi 3kg antenna Well a patch is unlikely to be very high gain. If you say high gain it's most likely a different construction i really want a very annoying emoji to throw at this kind of stuff. just one that says semantics in big text Yes I know this is a very pointless semantic argument :PepeDent:. I won't change my mind on this at all though. 3.5"" is a micro. And a micro doesn't need a 1.6W VTX unless you absolutely know you need it no one ever disagreed with the second part, you've kind of changed it up from what you originally said Regardless of how you want to call it, having 1.6w of analog on a quad that objectively will want to go fairly far away to have space to fly is a nice to have, especially if it doesn't cost you much performance since it doesn't weight that much and if you aren't building a toothpick 7 extra grams on a 3.5"" isn't a big deal"
"Far away to have space to fly? You can fly a 3.5"" pretty much anywhere","Semantics² - The solo is 12g, most 400mW VTXs should be like less than 1-2g, so 10-11 extra grams My point still stands, it's not going to be a big deal on a somewhat chonky 3.5"", it will be a like 3% difference in auw weight if the quad is 250-300g, it's not that much But like a 400% difference in price compared to a 400mW option If he has the budget it's a non problem 400% VTX price increase won't lead to 400% performance increase. That money would be better spent on nicer antennas imo. But this is just getting silly lol, I think we'd be stuck at this for hours ur silly. that's the conclusion"

Oooook. What *batteries* and charger do you have?,duracel batteries and a big batterie charger. or phone charger i have usb_c. -* Uhh. Yea none of that is going to be sufficient to build a drone ik. so thats why i asked what a good starting buget would be
What size drone do you want to build?,"like a small to medium that is kinda reliable. bc latter il atach a cam to fil cars at car meets K, so a 5"". At least. This will all be in USD $120 for a controller $120 for a charger $30 per battery (several are needed) $200 for the drone build (can be cheaper, depending on hardware selected)"
i have a calculator ready to calculate in my currency. ok. lets see. what charger  do i need?,"Hota H6 Pro or Hota D6 Pro.

hey everyone. I was planning to use Tarot TL65B01 which is a 650mm frame.  I was planning to use 17 inch props on this. Is that feasible? Idk what they mean by SLR configuration (not recommended) and then list out the parts for a 14-17inch prop?. taken from tarotrc page,"i've got the Tarot 650 Sports and even 15"" are a tight fit. don't think the Iron man 650 will tak 17"""
"idk, why do you need 17""?","I'm trying to use a SunnySky V5208 and need the thrust for a 17inch prop at 6S that one seems to take up to 20"" in that case check the X4 (TL4X001). also has better folding mechanism"
yeah you could try that how much would the 650 be for you? cause i'm seeing the X4 for 300$. i mean the motors are already 4x 80$ :face_with_tears_of_joy:,well certainly not as cheap as the 650 frame :grinning_face_with_sweat: that is like less than 100USD at my local shop. and with the extended arms only around 140USD
are sleeve dipole antennas good?. wait whats a monopole antenna??. how many types of antennas are there?,There's tons of different ways to construct something that can be described as an antenna
which ones are recomended for 2.4 elrs receivers?,"Monopole antennas only have a single, radiating element.   A piece of wire is a monopole antenna. A piece of wire cut to a specific length to match frequency wavelength is a tuned monopole antenna. Dipole antennas have two elements, one radiating and one connected to the shielding. Usually in the form of a T antenna (most common on radio link hardware), or as a sleeve dipole (usually for VTXs on light builds, but occasionally seen on radio link hardware as well) λ refers to the wavelength of the desired frequency"
what dual antennna elrs 2.4 receiver should i get?,"Betafpv SuperD, Radiomaster RP4TD, HappyModel EP1 Dual (TCXO)"
ty. is there a specific one i should pick?. i cant decide which one,"They're all good. Pick whichever one is cheaper/better available depends on ur quad size as well im building a 3"". i want to moun the receiver with double sided tape"
my uhh fc went for a swim and it now doesnt sense voltage. is there a way to use esc telemetry on a blheli_s / bluejay esc?. for voltage atleast,idk i just want to pack it with the most amount things even if its useful im even gonna buy a gps for it more stuff you can break.. just saying
im gonna get the radiomaster one i guess. so im gonna get a rp4td and 2x tbs tracer sleeve dipole. that gud?,it comes with antennas Yea stock Radiomaster antennas are good. Gobs of range
i want to upgrade the antenna on my tx12smk2 too. is that possible?,T-style dipoles are much easier to mount in more optimal spots. I'd stick with those. Most likely yes i think the t antennas wont even work with the stock antenna on the radio but im not sure Radio systems practically always use linear antennas
is this considered a upgrade? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/happymodel-antenne-moxon-24g-9081.html,It's an option. Whether it's an upgrade depends on the use case Radiomaster's moxon antennas are a nice upgrade
I just soldered 4 motors to a aio fcesc and when i arm they dont spin. I can feel the motors 'trying' to spin. What could this be?,When i go full throttle the esc shuts down. How do i check

can i use truerc  antennas made for dji on analog goggles?,"Yes, but they're likely LHCP, while most analog systems run on RHCP"

Can I charge a 2s 450mah lipo with this charger?,yeah looks like you can.

What is the most common mAh?,"I really don't know what the most common is. It would be different for everyone's requirements 1100mah is about the right size for a 6s 5"" drone battery. you can push that up to about 1500mah Lipo, but that extra weight comes with a performance penalty.      a 5000mah would only be used on a big drone."
"Thanks so much. @stickfighter @Lorin Wingtips FPV @Imnotaminor I'm actually trying to promote FPV RC car racing to drone pilots. I heard it's getting harder to fly due to stricter regulations. So, why not FPV on the ground?  I could provide the RC cars with FPV kits and drone owners bring along their goggles and LiPos. That's why I'm asking about the LiPo mAh.","RC cars use higher mAh (above 2000mAh). But still works with 1500mAh or lesser. most use 2s to 4s, where drones use 6s mostly. I'd be more interested in like remotely controlled rovers. Or even battle bots. That sounds fun I thought 4s is common too. I also drive a few RC FPV ground vehicles"
"Do u do it for fun, crawl or race?","4S is common for small drones, and used to be common 10 years ago for 5"" and racing drones."
"Cool!. Is 6S 1100mAh 100C to 120C common these days for drones?  We can use 6s as well for our elite class RC racing. We use Arrma Limitless. Each race is only for one lap, so 1100mAh SHOULD be enough.","Yeah, that's common.. 26.66 gram 75mm 1s Walksnail whoop"

What canopy should i use? I dont have screw hole in the cam,Dont have a 3d printer...
what does adding expo to rates do? like ik what it does but i have no idea whats the use of it. seems like adding expo makes flying more unpredictable,Then the betafpv air canopy. It gives more resolution close to the center while being able to keep a higher rate at the edge of the stick
so it kinda allows to make slow movements more precise while keeping the rates the same?,"4-in-1 air aio from betafpv. i've never seen anyone remove the camera plug on the new air aios, so i'm wondering if doing so would break something No one bothered to do so because the weight savings are basically negligible with how tiny this plug is"

Should I be in horizon or angle when flying inside my house?,"yeah nothing. cant be, ive got 2 brand new ones, this thing hasnt even been flown yet. it must be the camera thats damaged if anything IS damaged, but even then i have no idea how that would be remotely possible things being dead on arrival can happen, but also, just check the mipi connector, unplug both sides and replug"
Sure? My ADHD got the best of me,"yeah no. that's not how that works and that is cringe af It looks fine, It's a nice build! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:   but since you asked, ... most of those parts are much heavier than they need to be. The Meteor 75 frame is chonky, the canopy is very heavy, your VRX still has the heat spreader on it, and that Flight controller is packing on a lot of unneeded grams too. Plus, that camera usually weighs *more* than the mini, if the mini has the back plate removed, because you often have to add a mount to accept screws. (there are other ways).  each of those things being a few grams heavier than they need to be adds up to a drone being 1/3rd heavier than it should be.   If you want longer flight times and better performance, consider swapping the canopy to anything lighter.  A Mobula canopy would shed a couple grams alone. Also, with a more open canopy, you should consider removing the heat spreader to shave a few more grams. If you can find a Molite 7 ***V2*** frame, you could shed some weight there, too.. That looks like what happens when your camera cable is damaged. it could also be a bad camera a third possibility is the VTX not getting enough voltage. they tend to have lines and scrambled images just before they drop out from being undervolted, ... but there usually some portion of image left."
"HI, it would be ok for an 20A ESC if the motor can go up to 18A full throttle or should i buy an 35A ESC just to be safe?","afaik the peak current on the spec sheet for motors is a decent bit higher than youd ever see in flight, because the motor pulls more current on a bench at 100% than it would in the air thank you, ill stick with the 20A ESC then"

oh wait im stupid lmao. i was tyring to change the packet rate in the model settings instead of actually in the ELRS app thingy. i change it to F1000 right?. and then what about Tx power?,"ELRS won't let you change packet rate when connected and armed (being bound is a different term that means something else). it is that way intentionally. correction: connected and armed afaik. maybe just connected, not 100% sure on that front i do not think it was armed the arming switch is what matters. not the arming state of the craft i just got home so im gonna go check to see if i can change it but it may be even when just connected, I don't have a way to test rn"
what do you need F1000 for? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. That's where you set the power...,idk i thought youd just set it to the highest just becuase you can you get less range. FLRC actually has a bit more of a significant drop in range than <=500Hz
i know theres a difference between packet rate and tx power but im unaware if there was a general rule of thumb for settings. is there a good middle ground for packet rates/tx power?,"250 hz and power set to dynamic I would say 150hz for cinematic/Cinewhoop, 250hz for freestyle, 500hz for racing Power should be set to maximum, if your RX supports Telemetry (99% of them do), set dynamic power to on just updated to elrs 3.5 i neeeed my capacitors to arrive so i can get the drone running again"
Did you snap its legs or what?,"I did that 2 times lol i ordered a pack of 10 Oh nice. Mine is sooo close to the props lol You can see the dBm value next to the packet rate, that tells you the minimum signal strength at which it still has a chance to receive. which you should also adjust in BF CLI (with a + 10dBm margin of error) But also you should have LQ in your OSD, it's just not as linear as rssiDBM oh yeah i was gonna ask, if i wanted  to set an alarm on my osd for the rssi dbm what alarm should i set if it says -108 Oh yeah You want both, neither one shows the whole picture Idk how you guys failsafe elrs tho. I lose O3 much sooner than ELRS in BF CLI (no GUI for it yet) you can set the rssi dbm alarm If you have a floor of -108, the general recommendation is to raise it by 5-10dBm +10dBm would mean -98 > set osd_rssi_dbm_alarm = -98 > save"
maybe i can get some 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 used goggles for 300$?,what do you think cobra x are i meant 𝓯𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 𝓾𝓵𝓽𝓻𝓪 𝓼𝓶𝓪𝓵𝓵 𝓵𝓸𝔀 𝓹𝓻𝓸𝓯𝓵𝓮 goggles. i just love how they look not really without sacrificing a lot. 450 sure. but at 450 you just get walksnail/hdzero looks over everything else thats a smart move. yeah i prefer hdzero over everything but goggles+vtx+camera+antennas=800$ and im a cheap ahh so im sticking analog for now. i have no idea how i got these numbers remember. Doesn't really lose value
So how would you get HDZ for 450? Or is that an hdz receiver with some other goggles,Aren’t the hdz goggles like $600 (more like 700 after antennas and battery)
Oh used goggles? Sry I didn’t read all of chat,"made up prices to make it look like better value :PepeSus: just like everyone conveniently doesnt mention that you need to buy antennas/batteries for it additionally. and you wont find used hdzero goggles, or if you do not that cheap I would love to either get some digital system at some point but I’m too broke… Goggles L + some random ws kit is probably the cheapest in total hdzero vrx is ruining it's only benefit: latency, and youre still stuck with low quality  but if you want the fancy goggles from whatever digital system: hdzero/walksnail is cheaper in the long term if you use them on many quads and ironically dji is cheaper otherwise"
so top right just stays grey in betaflight?,"i cant get my gps to work (ws-m181). ive wired it up all correctly, triple checked all of my solders for potential bridges and i continuity checked every pad incase one of them was fucked from my lil capacitor mishap. ive checked if it works with the battery plugged in and with just usb power (which according to my FC, it will power gps while on just usb power). the gps doesnt get any warmer, and it especially wont show up in betaflight (toggled the right uart, set right protocol, and enabled GPS and save and reboot and everything is disabled again, so its not recognized by the fc). i also checked to see if i flashed the fc with GPS and I did. theres no LEDs on this gps for me to check if its working either"
"i get voltage through all at the connector except the ground obviously. waiiiit. the wiring diagram for my FC said that the GPS would wire up to the 4v5 pad (in the diagram its 5v -> 4v5), could that be the issue?. idk if all gps are made equally","4v5 is just ""5v but also through usb"". and your gps does want 5v but in the fc specs it says that its a 4.5v output. and im only reading 4.5v from that pad i think it's 4.5v when on usb. and 5v when battery lemme measure with battery but regardless it should be fine with battery it is still 4.5v yeah should be fine. so you got tx to rx and rx to tx show your betaflight stuff i guess what exactly should i show. https://i.imgur.com/2QMLKnZ.png when i enable this and reboot (after setting UART 6 to GPS), it disables itself and so does the UART when i restart show what you're trying to save on the ports tab. full screenshot https://i.imgur.com/vRz9PCu.png okay but why do you have configuration/msp enabled there erm. i thought that was just a toggle switch. LOL. like to turn the UART on. no way man. thank you lol. it works no that is something entirely different lol it's enabled for usb because it's the configuration port. it's enabled for your walksnail vtx because it uses MSP to communicate i understand. i thought it was literally an on/off switch for the port does betaflight have an altitude hold feature. i dont have a GPS so idk if i could even use it if it does (i dont know what determines altitude). but id like to hold up on my throttle, stop, and then have the drone hover"
"what should i upgrade? babyape to a custom built 3"" for around 500$ or darwinfpv mini goggles to skyzone cobra x v4?","That's the worry. Even a straight 6s might kill that fragile thing :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. Neither. Save a bit more and get Walksnail goggles L *and* a new drone. i dont want walksnail. analog, hdzero or nothing *shrug*. You asked for advice. That's my advice. walksnail just isnt my type"
kinda. (no). so should i get new goggles or new drone?,"Then you have no need of HDZero. It's bloody expensive, and exists to serve racers short range, low latency feeds in an open, managed environment.  It can function outside that, but it's a specialist bit of gear really."
"Also what are you doing to make a $500 analog 3""?","If you can't see where you're flying worth shit, you're just gonna crash and break a new drone in short order. im packing it with useless features Even then how the hell does it get to $500 That's like $50 extra tops GPS is 20 sheets, cheap AF. Both my drones are super nice 3.5 inch digital drones. And both were under 500 oh sorry its actually 350-400 (They were like 450 but ya get the point) i had some other things in my cart I truly don't understand why people who don't race use analog Spec it reasonably and get a proper quad and Cobra X. Price. Weight Excepet the vtx cost, its literally the same (unless you go for the cheapest shit ever) Oh that, I misunderstood the first time Like, why not go digital. Of course"
Some people want to start with like a 400 dollar budgey. Is that really that big?,"On whoops, definitely"
What are you referring to?,"The whoop vtx board, + camera 3.5g"
Would you mind telling me what frame and motors and fc/esc you used?,Analog VTXs can be sub1g ... Or just integrated onto the AIO Yeah I saw the 5 in ones. That is pretty cool this + ummagrip and radiomaster rp4td I have a freestyle one on a grinderino and an xi35. I used an AIO on both
hello. I have no idea who but someone told me this is good +. (on this server I think). is this still the case ?. (I've burned a lipo already - in a crash - so I've been looking for some strong stuff),"Tattu is known to make good batteries and their r-line is their “premium” line of batteries.

Maybe we should reconsider moving forward until it's done properly it's soldered correctly. What. wdym wtf"
how do I fix the CPU load?,turn the pid loop frequency down It's best not to continue until we can actually see that it's done properly sure. but send a picture of the soldering alright. started for a sec then stopped wheres the picture of the soldering the heatshrink is on. my dads a welder welding is not soldering. can you send a picture even of just the heatshrink don't bother answering. they're talking in 4 places at once and have multiple people helping them been warned multiple times not to ping random people for help too this has been going on for 2 months yupp. the stubborness is unreal

can you circle what you're asking about?. The TVS diode looks potentially blown,"I assumed the component in the middle that appears to be a transistor To explain the situation. This is a old AIO from my first drone. I somehow broke it while first configuring/starting it with a battery , I got a replacement. but i want to try and fix it. After visualy inspecting it nothing burned up and after connecting it via usb this chip gets VERY hot. also when i plug it in the Blue Light lights up for a slip second and then turns off It's probably a voltage regulator @Geri [Germany]. The issue is, just because it gets hot, doesn't mean that it's at fault"
even when its burning hot?. i have the same board twice and the working one isnt getting that hot,"Human hot is a lot lower than electronics hot, if we touch something at 45°c for long enough you will get a burn, but electronics can just stay at like 80°c and be fine i know but as i said the same Working borad isnt getting that Hot. after about 3 minutes its a 90°C or 194 °F. now its at 100°C. 110 and still rising"
Do you have a fan pointed at it or are you voluntarily trying to kill it ?,"its should not get so hot after 3 minuts. It getting so hot after 3min of cooking itself doesn't surprise me, our electronics are not meant to be passively cooled. They will just cook themselves if they don't have airflow over them. So just point a fan at the poor thing as i said i have the same borad but working and its not that hot. Even after 10 minutes It's not a reason to try to burn it more its already broken. im trying to fix it. the working board has a Hotspot of about 50°C"
"""my house is on fire, I wonder if looking at it burn will make it stop burning"" But also, when you power it on, does the last 2 beeps are a high then a low tone ?",i dont have it connector to motors or anything i am powering it via USB If you only power it via USB you have no ways of checking if the 5v is dead since the USB is supplying 5v.. okay i can solder a xt30 to it. give me a minute can do.

I don't really use pit mode but it doesn't look like it? Maybe an antenna issue? Hard to tell. Send some soldering pics,"didn't take any, will have to strip it since it probably needs a fix anyway. Also: I don't either, its just that my gear likes to do so :face_with_tongue:"
what gauge usually?. And are the skyzone 04l good goggles?,"do i need to buy cables or do cables come with all the parts i bought already Most of the time, the parts come with wires (most of the time), so it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a set of wires I just got the ethix set and a roll of 32awg wire, it works for basically everything For high end analog goggles I wouldn't bother with anything other than Sky04X Pro. takes all your digital inputs like a champ... but then just go digital im leaning to it being the camera, i have 2 brand new cables that worked, all of this worked hours prior to the reflash, so im doubtful it could be naything else to begin with. you can see the OSD shows up so vtx is prolly fine"
"is there any sense in using a aio in a 5""?","i just went back and watched it again, that wasnt really an attempt at all, was more like a dive into the goal post If you're doing an ultra-light toothpick build, it can make some sense.

"will do, thanks, do you know if it'd be bad to charge them while using them? like should i go the long but maybe safer route of removing the battery and replacing the connector to use an external lipo or just use a powerbank to extend the battery life?","twin motor setup for a large endurance plane, wouldnt be going full tilt often. about 6kg auw. if that makes a difference No clue about charging while using tbh. I would actually be curious if they'll boot from USB power alone, without  the internal lipo connected huh.. ill have to see, ill report back if i find anything out :) Hard to say without knowing more about the design, wing load, etc"
"thats fair enough, but just as a general ballpark, would 6s or 4s be better for crusiing taking that into account. considering the props would be at the same rpm for crusiing speed 6s would make more sense no? 700kv seems low for 4s on that size","If you're doing endurance cruising, with no regard for a target speed or distance, lower voltage is better thats news to me. well, actually that makes sense 6S 700Kv on a 13 prop gives you a prop tip speed around Mach 0.65--definitely in high-performance territory assuming crusing speed of 15m/s fyi On 4S that drops to Mach 0.42, much better for efficient cruising hmm. yeah. ill go 4s for now and see how they compare to each other. i have a feeling you will be right"
What are you looking to do?,"idk. i like the way they 𝓵𝓸𝓸𝓴. especially the cinerace20. i should just get freestyle 3"" at this point Please don’t buy a drone based off looks… I wasted like $1000 on two drones doing that Get a simulator and see what style you like most.

Have you flown before?,"toothpick and tinywhoop 3s for a 3"" isn't great in general, and 6s on a 3"" is just dead weight, 4s is the happy middle ground. And saying *""3s ain't enough for me""* is kinda dumb since the number of cells depends on the size of the quad, putting 3s on a 65mm is very dumb for example i was talking about a 3"" when i said that. at least i had that in mind Well, the above statement still holds, you want 4s, not 6s or 3s on a 3"" The crux3 runs 1-2s and it’s prob one of the better freestyle 3” you can get, at least for the price Well, it's a toothpick, so it's a different class than a general freestyle quad. And the crux 3's motors would explode on 2s if you talk about the 1s version, and on the (older crappier) 2s version, running it on 1s makes it very underpowered just tell me what to replace to make it cheaper (pls dont ask why ive added a gps i dont want it) Oh, I just see it’s recommended in the beginner shopping list Welp, if you don't want a toothpick it isn't going to be a good option, we mainly put it there cause it's cheap and fairly durable while flying well, but not everyone wants a toothpick"
is it possible to make it at least 50$ cheaper?,"By not using a t Rex and a gps and instead getting a baby ratel 2 or a full sized ratel 2 Also you don't have any batteries in there And I would also recommend you swap the motors for some xnovas, great little motors. It's going to be hard to fly it without batteries im buying them off a different shop"
"I see, which batteries did you get ?. And you also need an aio",*which batteries are you going to get ive ordered a a airbot fenix CNHL MiniStar 850mAh 4s

"round, shiny joints are good, right?","okay so im getting batteries from the same shop. wait a minute. now i remember why i didnt want gnb packs. the frame comes with a xt60 connector and these packs use xt30. ik i can get a adapter. but i dont want to use one. in fact i have one rn The frame doesn't come with an xt60. Or xt30 for that matter. The aio maybe, but not the frame. But you can just solder on an xt30 to the aio im pretty sure the frame comes with a connector. im gonna check. ah okay. it comes with bigger models. 5"" and up i think Anywho, you can just get an xt30 pigtail i have one but it has super thin cables Nah. Make one. Not hard"
wdym?. i replace the cables or what?,"Buy the connector, buy the cables, then magic you have an xt30 pigtail. Not that thin for a 3"" XT30's are pretty heat sensitive though, when soldering make sure you plug the connectors together to prevent the pins from misaligning But you could replace them with thicker cables fairly easily"
before i order the parts i want to buy new goggles... sky04o pro or cobra x?,"Well, both will be good, depends on how much money you want to spend Going with the x and saving a bit to then go with digital isn't a bad idea"
"Did you try digital ? Cause while I also love analog, I wouldn't say I prefer it over hdzero","im not a racer i just prefer analog. i didnt try digital, i also prefer hdzero over everything but 800$ is way over my dreams. if you know what i mean by that How can you say you prefer hdzero over everything if you never tried it YouTube has lots of compressions, and hdzero is more about the feel than the image, which YouTube can't transmit. Also, you could wait for hdzero to release their cheaper goggles Carl announced it in his live stream with Jesse Perkins i think i still want the sky04o pro Why not just wait for the official announcement of the goggles. It shouldn't be far away"
okay. is h264 dvr better than mjpeg dvr?,"is practicing on an xbox controller ok Might've been, still though with enough temperature it could still happen with genuine ones I mean, sure, but the yellow ones take a lot more heat to get soft.

Yes Flying from my house to like 2000ft down the road with my DJI did not go well because of the connection quality Yeah and here you also don't have reliable rth I should get GPS rescue perfect before I try that out"
can you explain to me why does this drone seem to fly good then?. maybe it doesnt. idk,"Because this quad is dead weight city, the 2004 motors are way too big, 1604 is the biggest that makes any sense on a 3"" (1404/1504 has basically as much prop control with slightly lower pitched props, like some 3016, but with a lot less weight) he also uses a full o3 which is a chonk, and a full 20x20 stack with a fairly heavy 45a esc, which is very overkill for a 3"" when you use reasonable motors, and the battery is also somewhat chonky even if it could be worse (it's equivalent to a 850mah 4s, which is big for a 3"")"
"2004!?. 2004 on a 3"" is wild","Yeah, it's just dumb big this thing is over 250g for sure The quad alone is above 250g. Before you add a battery A decent 3"" should be like 200g with a battery, if not less that thing is a remote controlled rock If you want an example of a more reasonable 3"" https://rotorbuilds.com/build/33312"
How do I find out what kind of amps I can flow through my usb c-xt60 cable? The brick that it’s plugged into can do 140w power delivery,"Well, a USB c cable can only handle a couple of amps. Iirc USB c is rated for like 5a The page for it says it can handle 5a but Google says usb c is for 0.5a to 5a so idk how much I can trust the product listing. The brick gets slightly warmer than ambient running on 2a 20v. I guess I could try 5a. It’s not like 2a is slow tho yeah usb c is rated at 5a max but at varying voltages. you can do 140w max but doing 28v at 5a. you can not do 14a at 10v, which is 140w. google `usb c power delivery`. usb PD is a standard can anyone help me with why i cant get my tarranis qx7 to bind with my happymodel ep1 reciever"
which transmitter module and baud/packet rate do you use?,"ok im still a begginer so i have no clue but my transmitter is bound with another fpv drone too qx7 uses the frsky protocol, its incompatible with elrs receivers crossfire also isn't compatible with ELRS so what can i do to make them bind or do i need to get a new reciever"
yes. if i get Bandit Nano ExpressLRS 915MHz RF Module will i be able to bind them?,no. there are different module sizes and 915Mhz vs 2.4GHz what do i need to get to be able to bind them
a 2.4GHz ELRS transmitter module. like the ranger if you want to stay with Radiomaster products. have you done the Crossfire inverter modification on the QX7?,"i have the crossfire installed on the back of the qx7 that one idk cuz i bought my fpv drone from someone who built it for me so now im getting myself into building them so idk if he done this one but if i do it what will it help with the QX7 is basically crippled from the factory, it won't be able to use full ELRS functionality without this hardware mod which allows it to run the external module at higher speeds"
so if i do this mod i will be able to bind them?,"its not necessary, just recommended i haven't done the mod yet and could bind + fly (configured with lower speeds) You should be able to bind the receiver to the transmitter *module* regardless of this mod. The key point to understand is that this mod allows the QX7 to communicate with the *transmitter module* i will try to do this mod because untill now i cant bind them but if both ways didnt work ill change to tbs crossfire receiver"
I have a tbs fusion module on my dji fpv goggles 2 and i have truerc air x2 antennas plugged into the goggles itselft and not the module will it still work if i leave it the goggles or i need to plug it into the module?,"Tried it at 20v 2.2a per channel and the current hit 5.6a and the power delivery thing cut power. Couldn’t overcurrent this thing even if I wanted to. Charging with 2a per channel @20v works perfect tho Just flew my mob 8 and had a weird fail safe, after the crash i wanted to take back off but the camera was shaking and the drone was flying uncontrollably into the air i had to let it drop again. I got it and noticed that the whole stack is loose of the frame. Am i able to just glue the stack back onto the frame or is there any other solution"
Is there a channel for part 107 license? Somewhere we can ask questions or help others?,"#commercial. or. #drone-laws Thanks :folded_hands:, appreciate it"
"If I add the DGI antenna on the module, will it still work?","if you dont have antennas on the module, the module will not work. what would the point of the module be lol. something broke. gotta fix what broke. send some pics"
"im not sure, I don't have DJI goggles nor do I know what frequencies those work on. you should really just buy a proper analog 5.8g antenna.. if the connectors match i guess theres no harm in trying it? if its tuned for 5.8g it might work but im not sure what the dji antennas are tuned for","I glued it onto the frame and just hovered it in my room and it worked again i think it was just vibrating really strong cause it was so loose. Im gotta charge a lipo and hover a little longer just to make sure if it works it works, but clearly something broke that should be fixed lol I dont think the esc or fc got any damage probably not. but it might just be a screw you can put back in Yeah how is the mob8 stack connected to the frame if you know youre the one with the drone :face_with_tears_of_joy:. theres a screw on the front, back, and sides of the stack. in the corners I glued it and dont wanna touch it much they go through the camera mount, through the aio board, and into the plastic frame. im guessing they ripped out. your glue might break next crash if youre worried about touching it now xd I still got all screws. Idk if theyre in the frame tho they probably pulled out of the frame. you can try to screw them back in, otherwise youll need a new frame, bigger screws, or to glue the screws into the frame. not a big deal. grab a few spare frames next time you order something lol I do for have em but im in college now and theyre at home What are some good analog goggles for cheap mainly for tinywhoops cobraX seems to be what everyone reccomends HDO2‘s or cobra x. Yeah ill see if this glue holds decently if not ill try putting them back into the frame and glue it :thumbs_up:. if the board is not flat or oriented differently at all it wont fly right. the orientation is important for the gyro Its pretty flat and straight hovered very good im gonna freestyle tmrw and see how it works. Thats what made it uncontrollable when it popped off probably"
Anybody knows this measure on cinelog 35v2?. On props Guard for leds,it's more about the size of the lipo. unless you're comparing to a similar capacity ye comparing to another 4s lipo whihc is 850. The IR cells on that are like 6/8/10 etc..
The PDB should be fine... what props are you planning to run?,"You're going to burn out those motors 320kv. These oneshttps://robokits.co.in/multirotor-spare-parts/brushless-motor-propeller-esc/brushless-motor/tarot-tl2954-4006-320kv-high-power-multicopter-brushless-motor Ah alright that's better. ~~Clearly not a legitimate Tarot motor, but w/e~~ nvm found it Ok, thanks for the help"
are there any nd filters cheaper than the tbs ones?,"the cells are paralel, too the charger doesn't know how many packs are connected that's why it's important to have the packs are the same voltage when connecting and to plug in all the main leads first and give it a moment before connecting all the balance leads"
"Also, just to confirm, since I'm charging 4 650mah 4s batteries, it would be 2.6A at 4s?. Good to know, thanks!. First time trying this and I would like to keep my house in an unburnt state",You should ask this in the Betaflight discord
Also which version of betaflight are you using?,"Ok this happens usually when SmartAudio/IRC Tramp isn't working. In the VTX tab, does it say: Device Ready: Yes. On the right side of BF. Your battery should be plugged in while you check this. If your FC isn't talking to ur VTX, you'll not be able to switch channels using Betaflight/OSD ye it says Tramp ready. I can do that"
is this soldering wire good?,"yes, 60/40 type lead solder. but the amount won't last you very long XD is the brand well-known where you're from idk. its some old wire i got from my dad I'd test it on a practice board first. see if it flows well at all i have a flux bottle so i dont need it to have a flux core not the point. but that's good. make sure your flux is non-corrosive just clean ur solders anyways a brush and some IPA makes the solders nice and shiny thing is most people fall victim to the ""I'll clean it up and finish tomorrow"" and by then damage is done its like that welding saying ""a grinder and paint makes me the welder i aint"" and NO ONE tells you that flux can be corrosive. you'd think that'd be incredibly common knowledge thrown in everywhere but no. it's willd when i did soldering for work the #1 thing was to clean your solders, you didnt pass QC if you didnt. maybe we just used a special type of solder that had corrosive flux in it. but otherwise flux is sticky and gross yeah usually workplaces use corrosive flux. that's just normal. probably way cheaper we almost never ever used paste or liquid flux tho. if you were using extra flux you were probably doing it wrong. it was never cheap shit solder, the stuff we did was highly specialized aerospace/military/aquatic stuff so it had to be *perfect* that's usually true when making new joints anyways"
motion sickness or what?,"I don't get exactly motion sick, it just feels weird, as if i'm getting overstimulated or there's too much going on i kind of get that i guess. maybe turn the brightness down, make sure you're sitting and have your head pointed forwards Brightness is all the way down on my Cobras, and it's nearly impossible to have my head pointed forwards with a lanyard that is almost wanting to suffocate me. I have an idea, not a very good idea, but it's an idea. I'm going to 3D Print a longer lanyard out of TPU"
"hey guys, does anyone know if the mach r5 sport is a good option for a beginner? ik its way too fast but i'll prob manage","use an external battery pack for the goggles and don't use a lanyard lol Already doing the first, but let me get to printing the lanyard It's really not a good option for a beginner"
Is it okay if I poke a Lil hole to vent lithium gas buildup over time? I've got a mavic air battery which is the biggest of them all and has been serving me well for 2 - 3 years now. Still works fine but is big,"Absolutely not. Get a new battery I'm just talking about the skin tho If they were supposed to vent gas they would have engineered a hole into the battery. The answer is **no** that is... not in any single way how batteries work. what kind of troll post did you read Ive seen YouTube videos of kids doing it. Its an awful idea I just see lithium buildup on some batteries Its not just buildup that gets cleaned 1 has Been serving me for 5 years eveb. And has slowwwwllyyy been expanding Batteries are completely sealed, they don't get ""buildup"" of anything. They expire battery crystallization is an irreversable aspect of lithium batteries, not to mention the rest 5 years is a pretty long life really"
How much is okay then?,My quad batteries usually last like 2 years
"I'm not sure how long lipos last but this ones a li ion batt. Still holds charge well tho. Soo when is a bulge too much then, like when should I throw it away?","Dispose of it safely. Honestly if it still works fine I kind of just keep using them. But in reality yeah the safest options just get a new one How do I dispose it. I can't just discharge kt When LiPos turn into spicy pillows, you give them to the people that deal with such things, before they burn your house down in your sleep. Often places like Best buy have the battery disposal box I'm in Switzerland. You usually have to discharge them before putting them away. But you can't really safely discharge them other than using the drone. Which I can't use rn. Cus my phone is bugging Anywhere that sells batteries has to take dead ones for disposal then IIRC, EU rules. You should ALWAYS put your batteries no matter what in a lipo safe bag.  You live in switzerland, Housing is hella expensive, let's not have another ban on drones.. And find a lipo recycler, and depend on them. Aight.. It's on half charge so Stop going back and forth, we've given you the safest options possible. Lithium is no joke. Storage charge. It should be sorta stable there. No I'm talking about discharging it now. Not using it. Ok. Out it goes"
What voltage pack is it?,"A headlamp bulb will flatten it permanently if you leave it connected, provided the pack isn't higher...  Alright. **Two** headlamp bulbs in series in your case.. **One** headlamp bulb will be fine. I would probably just fly it when you have the time. Its unlikely to just spontaneously explode, its more common for them to catch fire while charging or discharging I can't. My phones usb isn't working with the controller rn Discharging being of course, what the motors will do to it in a drone.. *derp* I could just leave it on idle. Turn it on and let it discharge but that would overhear the drone. Overheat Hence the headlamp bulb suggestion. I don't know which pin is what Obviously yes, but im not particularly worried about a flaming drone as much as i would be about a flaming drone *inside a house* It's a resistive load with a built in ""it's dead boss"" indicator.. Google does. Old car bulb, two bits of wire, bosh. Slowly discharging battery with a light to tell you when it's dead dead. Literally #2 on the warning label ""Never disassemble, puncture, ..."" It voids warranty. Disassembling it won't do shit as there's just another box inside. Sorta That is not why that warning is there. When you realise how hot and fast they burn. Ik. Aight I gtg but ima discharge it. Using USB. Just found an usb adapter You will shit your kecks upon realising what that warning is for first hand, this I can bet folding money on."
does your boxer have elrs?,then you can bind any tinywhoop to it that has a elrs reciever in it. i dont know if your able to get mobula 6's in the elrs version
What is the difference between a 1550mah 4s 100c battery and a 1300mah 75c 4s battery? I have a 4s system with Mamba F405 installed.,250mAh and 25C :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Will my system work smoothly?,"C ratings are mostly bullshit if you're comparing them between manufacturers. Honestly they're mostly bullshit even when comparing different products from the *same* manufacturer. It's all just marketing lies with a tiny little sprinkle of the truth.   So in effect, don't worry too much about the C rating difference.. I assume based on the size that you're working with a 4S 5"". If so, go for the 1300. I have a question how do you set up FPV drones like the complete thing because I was thinking of getting one, but it looks very difficult to set up and it doesn’t even come with the headset and it doesn’t even come with the batteries you have to put it in so the first time is a bit tricky, but then its a piece of cake. there are easy guides to follow and we can help you read https://oscarliang.com/how-to-build-fpv-drone/ It isn't hard if you're willing to learn. If you get a BNF model most of the work is already done for you. Getting a separate controller and goggle is not a big deal. Lots of video guides to help you my first drone took me like 3-4 hours in total from nothing to flying I have an FPV drone in my site here I’ll send it. TCMMRC 5inch FPV Drone with HD Camera for Adults, 220mm Racing Drone With F405 60A, 4S 2207.5 1850kv Motor, 800TVL, Freestyle Racing Drone DIY FPV Racing Drone  https://a.co/d/gu7SFZ8. That’s a drone I wanna get. But I know it’s not as easy as plug-in play. I have to plug in the batteries and antennas and then plug it into my windows computer and then I have to connect it to the FPV headset and controller. And I have no clue to do that with that specific model drone Oh god don't get that, and don't buy from Amazon"
Where should I get it from them?. And what’s a good FPV drone,"there are plenty of FPV specific websites. but first. get a radio (controller) and a sim (simulator). practice while learning about FPV and building/fixing them Yeah, I’m currently playing a simulator with an Xbox controller. I know that sounds stupid because I don’t have a radio so. Definitely start with a controller then And I know how to do that takeoff for you. Go on the tip of your wing then The muscle memory on a gamepad is all wrong https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 I started that as well waiting for my radio to  arrive. we don't even know his budget OK, but I’m sure I’m great at flying a drone. I’m just scared about the part of setting it up that looks scary. he might want to drop money on good shit. nah All the controllers in that list are decent you got plenty of guides and we are here It’s like building a computer oh yeah right. I was thinking you sent him to the overall list. like a PC yeah. there are like very few parts Yeah, I was looking at the list. I’ll just choose a pair of controllers and headset and then a decent drone. all are quite simple to install Except you don't have to solder everything together in a PC eh, soldering is not hard at all Yeah, I know the only few parts that are complicated is putting in the battery and that’s really it"
putting in the ram tho?. super hard,It isn't lol just daunting for new peoples
"Well, I’m gonna go take a look at that list and then see what I like.. How is that hard? I’m a PC builder myself and it’s quite easy.","I remember when CPUs had pins it just goes to show how easy it is to solder wires as I said, I went from parts to flying in about 4 hours of work. my second drone took me like 1h30m"
"I have ratel2,mambaf405,xıng2,radiomaster rp1,mamba1000v As you say, then it wouldn't be a problem if I used a 1500mah 25c battery, right (in the country I live in, batteries are not passed through customs and some sellers can bring them in limited quantities and the products I want do not come). I couldn't choose between 1300mah 75c and 1500mah 25c battery, which one should I choose?","And one thing about FPV drone picking I had to go to three different websites technically four because one of the websites are sketchy for one of the suggested goggles and that is crazy. I wish you was this one website where I could buy it all four different websites just for one little drone crazy. Like at this point, I might just get a radio and stick with digital FPV Yeah, it was like some offbrand Temu website or something"
"But then I found the same goggles on a different website that was actually good looking so. United States. Also, should I do what I said up there at the top? Of the messages and just get a radio and do digital FPV.. Because at first, I was just joking, but on second thought it doesn’t like a good idea","All of these sites are known good Zorro Radio Controller (M2) – RadioMaster RC  https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/zorro-radio-controller. Your Shopping Cart  https://www.racedayquads.com/cart. HappyModel Mobula7 1S Micro 75mm TinyWhoop FPV Racing Drone BNF ELRS F  https://www.fpvfaster.com/products/happymodel-mobula7-1s-micro-75mm-tinywhoop-fpv-racing-drone-bnf-elrs-frsky-2022-new That's legitimate, I've ordered direct from Radiomaster before Those are the websites where I got this stuff from. Ok. But like I said, do you think I should do just digital FPV because like I said I was joking at first but now that I think about it sounds like a good idea This is in Australia, that's a problem Because you don’t have to worry about battery or none of that This doesn't work lol It's not the same. What you're describing isn't just a ""digital"" drone, it's a camera drone like DJI. Which is absolutely garbage for real FPV flight. Even the stuff DJI markets as FPV is just terrible for real FPV flying You know, maybe this isn’t for me I should just stick with production quality drones like the ones that aren’t made for high-speed flying and all that There's nothing wrong with that. And flying with the goggles is a perfectly fun way to enjoy cruising around I know it just seems really cool and I really wanted it but it’s not really for me I guess You can work up to it. The beginner list is there for a reason, full of hardware that's been tested and proven I wish there was just one website for it all and like a decent drone or I can just search up a YouTube tutorial and thousands will pop up Welcome to a hobby that's a niche within a niche (within a niche). You won't find world-class paint brushes on Amazon either Yeah, that’s true. But I won’t give up. I will spend weeks of researching if I have to.. What is your recommendation of a decent beginner drone that has like 1000 YouTube tutorials and how to do it and it’s easy to set up for beginners Start looking at some of the playlists Joshua Bardwell has on his youtube channel literally every FPV drone is the same to setup. and you're currently in a server with thousands who have done the same. so please Well, there’s not one software for every F PV drone Betaflight is on 99% of FPV ~~drones~~ quadcopters And I’m just here because I wanted to know like what’s the steps and what you gotta do because it takes forever. Oh, for real bet they even be putting betaflight on boats now"
"I’m just not used to this kind of stuff because you know like I’m used to like having half 1000 software for multiple things. And also, why do you suggest not getting an FPV drone off of Amazon? What’s the difference? I looked at the reviews that had actual photos and most of them said it was great so.","Betaflight for the flight controller, EdgeTX for the radio, ESC-Configurator for the ESCs... that's really it. TMMRC has a habit of lighting itself on fire because the hardware is so cheap. Same for Eachine quads. Also Amazon's pricing on RC gear is always ridiculous Oh, OK. Well, I really wanna drone like that, but that won’t let itself on fire Because not gonna lie that drone that I put in the chat looks terrible Take a look on any of the websites I listed above for BNF drones that they offer. There are plenty of options."
what do you want to do with a drone? And for how much,I just want you to know for entertainment fly around. It looks really cool and yeah and I don’t really care about the price either. Probably around my neighborhood and in abandoned buildings
indoors? Around the garden? Larger backyard? Park? Bigger spaces? Mountains?,Probably just gonna be in abandoned buildings and around my neighborhood like I just said
with or without an HD camera like a GoPro on top of the drone?,"No, just a camera for my FPV I'd go with 3.5"" or 5"" then, 3.5"" is better if you want it to be a bit more lowkey but there aren't as many good pre-built options"
What the crap do those numbers mean?,"Quadcopter sizing refers to the diameter of the propeller Oh ok. All right, well I’m gonna go choose some decent quad copter setups  and hopefully they’re all on one same website. And yea very unlikely to happen I know have you seen a YouTuber name Nick FPV I’m trying to get a drone like his. His YouTube channel is what got me into this. And I literally want the exact same drone and headset that he has i was thinking of nick burns smh Like I’m trying to get the exact same set up and everything he has That's 100% a custom build. Looks like he has a bunch of different controllers and goggles too So you telling me I can’t buy that from a retail seller You can buy all the parts and build one yourself, but you aren't getting that off the shelf Bro, I’m struggling here to figure out what FPV drones are there ain’t no way I’m building one You can get something similar off the shelf your low self esteem is severely limiting your capabilities here Well, you know if you see one of his videos he has goggles that have like these black things sticking out of them in the gray. I know there’s a the antennas so.. Yeah, I know I just can barely put together LEGO so I don’t know how I’m gonna put together an FPV drone Looks like the DJI V2 Goggles (not the DJI Goggles 2, which are different). The V2 are outdated anyway. Again there are *lots* of tutorials, and lots of people here to help. Just slow your roll a little and start learning all the different pieces. Vitroid's site that was linked earlier is a great place to start OK, well my brain is having an overload and most of the time I just have these things like five seconds I really want them next second I move on and like nah  that ain’t for me so i’m probably not going to really go full in into this. I’m probably gonna stick with my monkey brain regular camera. Drones. And like I said digital FPV exist software ever like a hyper realistic app FPV game. I’m probably gonna copy it and get a radio as well so but thanks for trying to convince me. TrypFPV has great graphics. Idk about hyper realistic, but they're good"
"All right, thanks for letting me know. I will buy radio as soon as possible and then yeah do you know what I just had an idea why can’t there be an FPV game where you need a VR headset just like an FPV drone where you need some goggles. Because if you seen what FPV drone looks like from the inside, then just make it in VR I’m a genius does that exist?",You could just as easily display the game inside a VR headset or pair of goggles (as long as they have an HDMI input). I've done it myself. The PC just sees it as another display output
"Well, I use a Meta Quest and a cable USB A to USB-C cable so I don’t know if if I can get that to work but probably so. I’m gonna search up YouTube tutorials on  to do it though. Does it work with every FPV game or some?",Yea I think you can use the Quest as a normal screen for anything at this point
Do you have a video on how to do it?,"I don't, but I'm sure you can google how to use a Quest as a computer monitor"
Or what does it look like? I need to know what the inside of an FPV goggle looks like. Because if it’s just like a flat screen inside a goggle and I can totally do that,"that's what it looks like FPV Goggles are very similar to VR goggles, except that both eyes see the same image--there is no parallax offset to give you depth perception. Think of it more like sitting in your own private movie theater So like that one VR app called big screen. Just a smaller screen in front of your eyes it's not VR tho. it won't seem fixed in 3d space. it will always be like strapped to your head So like if a phone was strapped to my face and it was looking at the drone feed There are other reasons why that's a bad idea, but sure Ok well I’m gonna figure out how to do this and yea so thanks for trying to get me into this, but I guess it’s just not for me. I’ll stick with the digital stuff.. Never mind, I just saw a video plenty of them of how to connect your oculus to your FPV drone I just re-gained a whole Lotta confidence of doing this. Because I don’t need the goggles anymore I just need the FPV drone and the controller, but it might still be hard to set up even harder since it’s an oculus headset"
"oh you will need the goggles. VR goggles can't substitute them, only for sim-ing. like how will the video get from the drone to the oculus?","Analog to HDMI out maybe, or USB-OTG. Latency hell I have no clue. I don’t know how the dude set it up.. Yeah, in the video it was very static That's analog FPV for you But I’m gonna go set up FPV in VR and yeah yeah, that's a good first step and you'll see how much you'll like it @sim"
"oh ok. also the vtx is not binding, i am pressing the vtx button and the light turns red, then i long press the vrx button and get beeping. maybe a firmware update?","Yeah, I found an FPV VR game. I just don’t have any money to get it so can someone buy me the game on steam (jk but seriously though if you wanna buy me the game on steam, add me my name is volcanoye12 so add me and then give me the game and I may pay you back no promises). So I’ll see how good that is can someone help me with betaflight firmware not updating because it failed to open serial port always firmware update. lol. like 99% of the time welp that didnt work.

i installed my camera upside down :( is there any way to flip the analog video feed?. the camera is tiny whoop pinch,"i cut the wire too short. it's got like some heat shrink around the base of the wires so i'm not sure if i can replace the wires. but yes, good idea :Harold:"
"where do i solder on the camera, elrs, and vtx?","well, you go take a look at the pads on the camera, receiver and vtx, then look at the pads on the aio, and solder accordingly (i.e the elrs rx will have a 5v, gnd, tx and rx pad, you solder the 5v to 5v, gnd to gnd, tx to rx, and rx to tx)"
okay tysm. cam is the same as video?. THE NAMES ARE SO HARD TO READ. thank got theres a soldering manual for this aio,"go on airbot's website i have no clue what capacitor to use. i have a 1000microf 35v and a 220microf 16v Well, it depends on the voltage you use What size/kv motors do i need for a 3.5inch frame like the valador vx 3.5 For kv I think it would help to know the voltage you plan on running 4s. (im the same person) Ok:face_with_tears_of_joy:"
or is 4s on a 3.5 to low?,I mean that seems perfect. 5” used to run that
so you'd recommend 4s 3.5inch over 6s 3.5inch?,"I’m hecka new to this so idk is gonna be digital so on the heavier side i gues (just the extra weight of the video system) But I would guess might as well go 5” for 6s oh haha. i sold my 5 inch 6s build, i have no space for it. like to fly it. ya know I was just asking what voltage cause I knew that was somthing someone else would ask when doing motor KV so I figured it would be easier for them to answer whenever someone more knowledgeable than me came around:face_with_tears_of_joy:. Oh ok understandable, i shouldve mentioned it yes haha If why you’re doing 3.5 is space then I would think 4s would be better. But what do I know:face_with_tears_of_joy: true haha. im putting together a parts list but idk what to do for motors ya know"
is everything soldered on correctly so far?,Also tin the wires first. And tin the pad. Then melt together
do i solder on the elrs to tx rx 2 or tx rx 4?. okay,"Doesn’t matter, you change the settings in BF okay ty. why tf is my temperature at 200°c :skull:. yeah its at 350 now. this is why it was so hard to do it. yo why is ny temp going down by itself. somethings wrong Lmao yeah. I get worried ay 90c"
ive turned it off and on and now its fine. where does the camera solder on?,"Top left, V-I is  ""Video In"", V-O is ""Video Out"""
on the cam i have video gnd and 5v. so i use video in?,Cam Video -> AIO Video In okay ty. i think that everythings done. im gonna brush it with some iso alc and let yall know what happens when i connect it to my pc
"Hey, can i charge 1s lipos with the same charger as i use for my 6s?","Yes, though you'll likely need some sort of adapter to plug it in. Multi-cell chargers require both the main and balance leads to be connected. In 1S mode it might not, but if it does you'll need a 1S charging adapter Ahh okay, ill have a look. thanks for the help! If you need to charge multiple 1S batteries, you can use a 1S charging board which will make all of them appear to the charger as if it were a multi-cell battery The 16V should be fine what is this. ik its a capacitor but. its not rated the same as the other ones That's a 390uF 20V cap Maybe, I'm trying to find its ESR rating"
should i go for 4s or 6s on my 3.5 inch? like does 6s have less flightime?,"It doesn't matter, flight time should be about the same. Personally I think the higher voltage doesn't add any beneft in the case of a 3.5"", but some people swear by it. Yes you can use it too, ESR looks like it's 25mOhm"
less then on a 5inch? would it be comparable to the sag of a 6s 5inch?,"IMO yes, 4S 3.5"" and 6S 5"" should ""feel"" similar, electrically"
okay. now what would be the mah range for 4s? with like 1604 motors on like 3500kv range. like could it caryy a 1000mah for cruising and 500 mah for freestyle?,1000mAh would be about the upper limit IMO. 850mAh is a nice middle ground. 650mAh if you wanna be light and nimble
so. see if i have a. 20x20vtx. and my fc and esc are 30x30. how do i mount that vtx. on the bottom below all of them or on top somehow?,"okay and last question, is a decent fligh time achievable on a 3.5 inch thats like 300grams without bat .... It has a 20x20 stack mount in the trunk. That's a heavy girl"
how do i make my aio know that its tilted 45° so the gyro works correctly?. does the longer leg of the capacitor connect to positive?,"Betaflight Configurator > Configuration Tab > Board and Sensor Alignment Adjust ""Yaw Degrees"" until the model on the Setup tab moves properly when you move the quad in your hand. The colored side of the cap body is the negative side. I can't guess without knowing everything you want to put on it volador 3.5inch frame, walksnail moonlight, speedyubee mini stack, uncertain about motors some ep1 elrs reciever and a capacitor All things being variable, I would guess the dry weight would be not more than 250g Speedybee stack is like 13g and the moonlight is 38.5g with antennas. My walksnail 5” “ultralight :winking_face:” with a moonlight and 20x20 stack is 328g using a GPS, 720mah 6s, triblades, and the ummagawd 2fiddy frame which I have no idea how it compares in weight to the volador You can also fairly easily build it to be ~250g auw"
Should I risk running these 5.1s? Ignore the mangled antenna mount I’m gonna reprint it when my new printer arrives tomorrow,"ahh thats also nice for regulations and stuff! You can put a ziptie over the antenna mount to tighten the antennas together if you want, the vtx clearance is fine, just make sure there isn't any wires the props could catch, cause they will end up catching them. Regulations don't care about your dry weight, they care about your auw Ok. If it clips the vtx it’s not like it’ll damage the vtx anything further than cosmetically. Might drop out of the sky to a broken prop but that’s fine true, in that case, frick the police!"
can someone send a screenshot of the motors tab from bf? i cant do it myself rn and i need to see something from it,"This build is so scuffed because of this dogshit print Yes metal is stronger than PC, but it's still fairly unlikely it will hit the vtx, and worse case scenario, you will end up with self clearancing props. I would just worry a bit about that antenna mount. And the prop will not get damaged significantly enough by touching the vtx to make your quad drop out of the sky"
anyone know which are the stack screws?. I am guessing the long black ones. but then what are the metal ones,It's the ones that are long enough to be stack screws
Shit like. the black ones?,"Idk, I don't even know what frame you have, but just try both and see which one is long enough"
why doesnt my soldering wire stick to the power cable pads?,"fluxxx. not enough heat I'm assuming you are having issues with the ground pad, and that's just because the ground pad is essentially a big heatsink going through the pcb, so you need more heat keep the solder iron on the pad a bit longer yeah im using the smallest one i have Go grab the biggest one you have then For the esc pads you want a chonkier tip the use of ""stick"" is also concerning, you're supposed to have a solder blob on the pad that you put the wire fully into using 480°c fixed the problem"
if in doubt apply more heat. you building drone right now to?,"If you're using 480c you have a terrible tip with no heat transfer. 350c should be perfectly fine unless you're using a conical tip Flew great without zip tying the antennas for fucks sake man. i've already fucked it No damage to anything, made sure I pushed the drone really hard fuck this shit. stack screw is stuck in a press fitting, fucked 2 allen keys. now what"
buy high quality screwdrivers i guess?. i mean this is a solvable issue nothing is ruined,"i've fucked the stack threads as well. tried to hold it with a wrench and twist the screw out. still nothing. *stack screw threads Reminds me of how I have one of my demibot's arms locked forever because they include weak 10.9 grade screws with it. If the right rear arm ever breaks, I have no idea how I will replace it without just using another frame, or how to tighten it if it comes loose where the fuck can i get new stack screws. and press fittings On any store. Just make sure you get some 12.9 grade screws"
actually. you know what size they are?,"Sorry I left my bionic eyes at home M4 is basically never used in this hobby, and it looks like an m3 screw"
Can't you just leave it on ?,hardware store and various sites its hitting the frame and i cant put the aio in
Flip it over ?. Or use longer gummies,"if i use longer ones the screws are too short. im just gonna flip it over Also, just make sure you have a reasonable spacing between the frame and aio, iirc the gummies airbot includes are pretty tiny If you don't have a hot air station, cut it off and then desolder the pins"
if ive connected one motor should there be the startup sound?,"that press fitting is so fucked now. theres no way it would even go back on the frame. and its still fucking stuck Yes, once you plug a lipo in. It will probably be pretty faint tho oh my gawd no wya. i broke it. im pretty sure i broke it"
"okay so, I have rust on the bell magnets and the actual motor magnets, how would I remove that?","same fucking feeling man, this shit is stupid as hell oh it magically got fixed. i think there was a short somewhere. ive resoldered it and now its un_ucked. wait. only 1 motor works. ive soldered on 2"
So only one motor spins ? Does the second one jiggle a bit or does it just not move ?,"And show a picture of your soldering. That doesn't answer my question. And it's pretty likely either your soldering sucks, or the startup power is too low ive havent used flux on it yet Why do you have solder on your mosfets"
Why does my RM Pocket constantly corrupt it's own SD card??????,"because im doodoo at soldering Well remove it, and check if you didn't short your motor pads the fact you plugged it in with random metal all over the thing isn't a good sign"
Did you try asking it nicely to stop ?,it doesnt want to come off You also have some here. You should seriously check the entire board for other bits of solder you sprayed over the board
respectfully what even causes that to happen. shitty quality solder?,"it doesnt want to come off fr slingshot and little practice And it seems like you have a capacitor missing here, on every picture of the aio I found there is a cap here https://tenor.com/view/disappear-gif-24972837 The more you look at this board the worse it looks there isnt a short its just a bad picture ive checked it rn finally managed to get that screw out"
Are the 1504 motors from darwinfpv any good?,Darwinfpv in general is pretty bad
So i buy a different brand?,Cause their products are crappy with low quality components
What size motors should go on a 3.5inch? Are 1804's to big?,"Yeah, for motors look at T-motor/xing(iflight)/xnova/rcinpower I would recommend you go with some 1604, cause it's lighter and you don't really loose anything, T-motor has some nice ones with their pacer line, but 1804 will work fine They are made as cheaply as possible like emax and such, but added on top they genuinely downgrade parts that they shouldn't and they overwork basically everything. The result is that literally everyone I have ever seen get something from Darwin has had it go up in flames or stop working, you can find quite a bit of it in this Discord alone. It's broken by design. they're the reason oceolo just above is having to do all of this soldering now too They teach you to repair your electronics right out of the box they fell for it even though we told them it'd go up in flames. lol Alr, i cant seem to find manny 1604's though Would it be better to eventually move to actually normal quads after I get over the learning curve and phase  instead of just sticking to tinywhoops or is there nothing wrong with whoops"
"So it turns out, the press fitting on the frame is a bit fucked, the threads aren't right on it hence why it got stuck like that. Whre can i find new press fittings?","Again, T-motor pacer 1604 are very good nothing wrong with tinywhoops, just fly what you enjoy and try out new things if you want :p. tinywhoops are awesome Thing is, normal quads are literal murder machines. Micros in general are awesome, there is no ""normal quad"" (that is just discrimination from the mini quad people), I have a 5"" on my wall but most of my flying is still with micros, there is no better just preference there are some differences in behaviour as you go up in size, but 90% of skill translates."
miniwhoops are easier. macro whoops?,"i can never get the name right. 3""-7"" are downright easier than tinywhoops ducted stuff generally has a little more of a constrained behaviour than unducted and I don't feel like wanting to go to jail because I crashed into someone at sunrise -# Yes, yes, don't re-educate me, I only fly when there's absolutely NO ONE around, triple checking every hour Oh, they are 'cheap' aswell!

That attitude isn't helping you. Thats ok. But not light"
I don't think so.. :grimacing_face:. so i need to flash it allover again?,"just `diff all` in CLI, `Save to file` in the bottom right, flash it again, go to the CLI, open up the file you saved, copy everything into the CLI currently flashing, ill update soon thanks!. :sleepy_face:. new prob"
have you flashed it before?,"yeah ofc but i had this problem a long time, i don't remember how to fix it. tried impulserc and it didn't work"
can you show what options you're using to flash?. and what shows up in device manager. well that's weird :thinkies:. try a different cable,the cable i use works. its the same cable i use always try replugging it until it doesn't fail the request then. if it's usb-c maybe flip it. speedybee fcs are known for weak usb-c ports that break. so be careful
Does anyone here have a portfolio website? Just looking for some inspiration,it *should* be okay if your buzzer is self-powered. goofy aio to not have a buzzer pad though
maybe?. depends on how your aio is designed,i would expect LEDs pad to be more capable than others but i will try the LED ones :slightly_smiling_face:

have you got bidirectional dshot turned on?. (asking because I want it to be off),I'll try that.. I'll keep you posted. Oh. Off. Alright. gotcha
so not that issue. what does esc-configurator show?,I'll send a screenshot. here. this is that it looks like
Do I click read or write?. Settings,you don't need to do anything here for now
I have not flashed it yet. Do I click write or read?,you don't need to do anything here for now
Alright. What do you mean?. What should I do?,"answer my question :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. and unplug the battery for now No, some motors spin in a dif direction iirc you have some motors that spin up and some that don't"
I have not flashed it before. Can I flash it now?,I have no idea what you're trying to achieve Trying to get all the motors to spin
I need to understand how the motors on your drone behave. Do the same motors spin up/not spin up?. Do they spin up smoothly?. Do the other motors twitch?,2 motors spin. 2 spin smoothly. 2 others try to go but they cant Okay. go back into ESC Configurator
"So I have bluejay, I should not have bi directional dshot?","on the left you have startup power Change it to min=1100, max=1200. and then write settings"
change Demag compensation to medium (or high? idk) and  RPM Power Protection to 10x,and click write settings
Do I click low or high?. ok. done,"now completely power cycle it (no USB, no battery). and try again if the motors run"
Its the motor direction. How do i fix that?. I never took apart my motors,"hey sorry. i was asleep. starting to spin. but not spinning. IT WORKS. OH MY GOD. TY. when I go up it's not going up. the motors are just spinning. i'm putting throttle in well that's motor directions or props being wrong. you might need to raise the idle in BF a little to get them to spin up reliably First of all in BF Motors tab, make sure that ""Motor Direction is Reversed"" is ticked @Call me Night Hawk. if it wasnt, change and save. (it helps whoops whoop). Then, there are motor wizards in there. you should either have props off, or the drone secured against flight somehow Alright. Thx. Oh sweet. Ill lyk hey i want more fps and less lag on my googles i have the dji 03 air unit and people say dont get googles 3 because of the signal loss so what should i get out of the dji goggles 2 v2 or Integra When i do the wizard the motors dont spin Typical my aio the extra plugs touches the frame and won't sit flush! Lol.  It would appear these 2 plugs are for receiver and analog cam.  I am using a caddx vista polar, so I'll be conneting it via the digital socket it has and I'll be soldering my receiver.   Any harm in desoldering these 2 sockets Nope. If you don't need em, take em off.. Mass reduction too.. The other option is longer screws, and extra gummies on the screws first, to raise the AIO up a fraction.. Some gummies have longer bits on one side too. Cheers I'll do that!! Nah can't use longer screws. As it would touch the vista unit.   Off they come+ all the motors work. @The GGManiack. i reordered it. it's still not going up though. My wizard is not working. not letting me use save and reboot"
For changing motor direction?,"Wizard in betaflight. motor reordering That can be buggy, use esc-configurator.com"
thanks. how do I fix it?. How do I use esc-config?. Do I just reorder the mots in that?,reverse. says failed reading Needs the battery to be plugged in
ok. says failed reading still. How do I flash it in betaflight?. Is there a way to do that?,No. Get to the same page like you did here ok. saying this. saying failed. dude. wtf. how do i fix this. im in make sure your battery is sufficiently charged @Call me Night Hawk
it is. here. it's there. what do I do now?. do I make the motors reversed?,U see where it says motor direction on the right next to each motor. Drop down menu you can change it. Change the motors you need then click write setup or save. You should hear your esc restart Please props off :p when working on esc
Do i click flash firmware?. To esc?. Or write?,Along the bottom. Write setup somewhere So when ever you make changes to esc. U save it by write setup. Flash firmware is to update its entire firmware.
Great. How do I know which motor is which?. like this?,``` 4  ^  2    |  3     1 ``` you can see a better diagram in BF Motors tab
Did u not change it via the esc?,I did. what do i click I am running out of brain cells I think I thought you already did its spinning in the wrong direction. I clicked reverse on 1. then I clicked write
"ok, does it spin correctly now?",then i went to betaflight and tried the motor. no
"I should click reversed, right?. Yes. I am","You should pick the opposite of what was there normal -> reversed reversed -> normal i'll lyk. one sec. still not working I clicked reverse. and writed it. and then closed out of the tab. and took out the battery. and usb. then plugged it back in for betaflight. then I went to motors and tested it see if changing it to normal fixes it ok. got it. its working. ill see if it takes off now. dude. i send a vid well, so you're doing something wrong. send a photo of the drone oh i see. the props are making it go to the ground. not up yeah. I wanna see the props"
Ok. Do I change the spinning of the motor?. esc. to reversed?. From normal,you could've sent a much better photo but this will do ig
Ok. How do I change the spinning of the props?. Would that fix it?,"huh. ok. im waiting. sorry first of all this. tick it. and save cause that's how your props are set up now, let's guess that all of the motors are wrong. so set them all to the opposite of what they were. normal -> reversed, and vice-versa write setup. and try again write settings and try if it works the props are kind of spinning. and then i hear a beep. then it stops"
is the battery charged..?,"well, ugh. go into BF Motors tab whenever I move the right stick to the right the power goes up well that much is expected if you think about how it works.. in BF Motors tab, spin up each motor individually, and figure out which way it's spinning.. Compare it to the diagram also check if theres hair or something in your motors it hasn't flown, ever, afaik they work. i'll try a new battery"
"did you check the spin directions?. -_-. if you ACTUALLY know that the battery is charged, then why would you need to change the battery?. or were you lying to me?",And I've run out of f*s to give Sounds like the back of the motors are rubbing on the frame or something to me. Some resistance to rotation that shouldn't be there.
what sounds? :neutral_face:,"A metaphor, from the reading of the problem. how could you know that there is some rubbing Spinning a while then stalling out. But only 1 motor is spinning Motor screws too long, or frame is rubbing on the back end of the motor shaft. .... please grab some context before responding any more (from personal experience, y'see) I don't wanna be rude but like.... bruh. it's a brand new whoop, motors and props are untouched.  The FC has been touched in many firmware ways without proper caution... My absolute bad. Let me re-read, but go further back. :yellow_heart:"
@Call me Night Hawk what's the motor issue now?,"The screws were to tight. Just unscrewed them Oh, what have I done. :Harold:"
did you touch the motor screws? @Call me Night Hawk,Then they were not the issue I touched the screws that hols the frame to the body change this to 8 @Call me Night Hawk
"Can we get another pic of the drone, top down, all four props in view please?","Just to triple check the props. I feel I ought to do a proper job, after making things more confusing, like a tit. :yellow_heart:. Right, props and BF agree, confirmed. @cyberFluke the FC was flashed or wiped, and the ESCs were flashed to bluejay, which is known to be a lil bit troublesome with the ESCs on this board, when it comes to idle at least so we kicked up the startup power. and now trying the idle% too. ofc the motor directions were also wrong lol later. it can be turned on any time later right now I don't wanna deal with extra issues that can happen on this fc. (CPU load, DMA conflict, etc)"
"So what should I do?. Well, anything in betaflight?","check one thing for me - board alignment in BF Setup tab, there is a 3D model of the drone make sure that when you rotate the real drone, the 3D drone rotates on the same axis. if you tilt the real drone forward. the 3D drone should also tilt forward (Relative to the forward arrow) yes. it does that. also, i have my pid to 2.00"
if that has something to do with it. what?,"What did you do and where uhh, that's.. fine. not ideal but fine for now"
ok. What should I make it?,"4.0kHz if CPU allows. if not, this, or 2.0 Do not change *anything* unless asked to going forward. It can make diagnostics very difficult. :p Gotcha. It's a mobula 7 it is now running a mishmash of firmwares that it was never meant to run. I'm considering guiding you on how to make it stock lol. but not rn. ran out of time"
You should. how do I make it stock?. That's seems like a good option,step 1: figure out EXACTLY which mobula it is just type out what to do if you dont have time step 2: find a config backup from the manufacturer step 3: figure out what firmware version they used (you can usually find it in the backup or its name)
Flash stock manufacturers downloads for that machine?,step 4: flash that firmware and restore that backup I can try and help from here if you're out. :thumbs_up:

alr. Do I plug in a battery?,"wait, I missed something.

Only add a little motor power. you can frag the motors doing this if you're not careful. they work. they spin the right way Excellent.. Click Stop motors. Then disconnect from the USB, and disconnect the LiPo. Alright... it should arm via radio at this point."
Do I start the radio?,"we need to still do a few bits, but make sure it arms.. Yep Radio on, then LiPo on drone.. Always radio on first."
it's on. do I throttle up?,"be ready for it to go yeet only 2 motors are spinning. I GOT IT. I GOT IT ITS WORKING. btw, I don't have an OSD You can play with OSD stuff to your hearts content. Don't add much though, it can overload the CPU. if the motors still have startup trouble, I'd raise the startup power a bit more in esc-configurator"
Try enabling bidir shot at this point?,I'm toying with the idea of dynamic idle @cyberFluke. but I have no clue if it has enough CPU trying to real the esc. one sec. brb That's what I was thinking I'll leave ya to it then :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. gtg sit in traffic
For esc config. Do i plug in lipo first then usb?. Or the other way,"In BF configurator, motors tab. Don't need lipo for this he's asking about my recommendation for the esc config I think for the startup power. (to fix the startup issue)"
wrong reaction. What do I do?,"I'm doing this from memory, so I nee the screenies to make sure I give you the exact right instructions :winking_face: FYI Lipo first, USB second.  You want the drone to explode without the USB plugged in, in case it has a reason to explode.  (unless you already know that it didn't explode the first time) enable Bidirectional DSHOT. yep. lemme check something Yep. That's right.  9N**12P**  Number of poles in the motor. Now open ESC configurator and connect. Read settings, then gimme screenie so I can see what we have scroll down and lemme see the rest. right. disconenct. BF configurator again.. PID Tuning tab DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN HERE.  This is complicated shit that can ruin your day if you'renot very careful. PID Profile settings.. You jumped ahead. Again. I saw it in a yt vid. I did not click anything. Ok Set **your** dynamic idle to 35% and let's see how we get on. I'm using my 2.5"" cinewhoop for comparison now, FYI."
save and reboot?. Great,"disconnect. Radio on, LiPo on, see if it arms properly."
Can you use the fatshark dominator with analog quick question?,"I've seen on the website that it's analog and digital but I've only seen walksnail digital reviews. That's why I'm unsure its the bottom left. that is not working https://www.reddit.com/r/fpv/comments/120iap8/fatshark_dominator_hd_with_analog_vtx/ Hd02 is the other lne. The one I'm talking about is the fatshark dominator Assuming you mean the Avatar/Walksnail/Fatshark goggle, no there is no analog input possible only 1 is on when its armed. when I increase power 3 of them work. and 1 does not"
Do you know what's going on?,It's the idle throttle soeed No I'm not really paying attention to your issue right now Increase your idle throttle by a bit until all the motors spin on arming. DO NOT SET IT TOO HIGH OR THE QUAS WILL FLY OFF. Damn We now know it's on the right firmware.  The motors are spinning ok in BF.  They're spinning the right way.
Yes. So what would the problem be?. Only 1 is rotating,"Seems like they meant a module to go with the dominator Bluejay needs more startup@cyberFluke Nope that's the old Dominator V3 from 2015 Was just looking up other people's numbers, I don't have a whoop to hand to get ballpark figs from :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Fat Shark is *ass* at naming things ESC configurator, no lipo. ok. i'm in esc config. without a lipo @cyberFluke that needs lipo Fat Shark expensive stuff"
read settings. on an AIO?,Ehh... Depends on the board
So. I plug in a lipo?,"If it reads the settings, we're ok. if it won't, you'll need a lipo read settings, give screenie. increase minimum startup power to 1200, and max startup to 1300.. then write settings. won't go to 1200. only this increase the max first. There it'll have to be then.."
"d/c, radio on, replug lipo. arm.. result?",COME ON MAX. LETS GOOOOO one sec. I just plugged in the lipo. radio is on. i have to bind it again. 2 mins bind the radio to betaflight
But why? It was just bound?,He's doing secret stuff! https://tenor.com/view/john-cena-im-watching-you-i-am-watching-you-wwe-watch-out-gif-25856329 waiting for it to bind. do you want to go in vc. and see. and help i'll show my cam. voice 1 unplug the lipo for a few seconds if it isn't binding.
nothing on the radio?,"i just binded it again. forgot to hit save. hopefully this works DUDE. its not binding Connect to PC, BF configurator, reciever tab.. Give screenie.. You keep doing extra stuff, and it's making this so much harder than it ever needed to be. A while back, I thought English wasn't his first language"
Should I make the pid lower?. it's at 2.00,Do **nothing** until and unless you're told to. ok. I'm not. doing anything. im frozen
"Every time you twiddle something without being told to do so, you fuxx something. We then have to try and figure out what it is you've fuxxed so we can unfuxx it. You get me?",Yes sir.. or ma'am. I understand.
"Hi, could someone help me setup ESCs in esc-configurator please?","then type ""set expresslrs_uid = 0,0,240,96,125,211"". hit enter radio said telementary recovered yo. when i bind drone. it beep non stop Put it down, see if it arms pls help its pavo20 pro. i did plug battery 3 times trick it beepeed for so long. so i plugged battery out. scared it gonna explode"
How does it do if you try and arm it?,"only 2 are working. omfg am i supposed to set up o3 first it's ok, we're getting there got it. it works. thank you man. I appreciate it"
Will it hover as it should?,"Now, before you do **anything** else, I would plug it in again, go into BF configurator, Presets tab, Save Backup.. Save the file as ""Working Settings"" and put it somewhere safe, like email it to yourself. Seriously, do that, these drones sometimes forget their config@Call me Night Hawk Once that's done.... Go fly :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
"Hi, could someone help me setup ESCs in esc-configurator please? It's showing ESC 2, 3 and 4. Why is the first one missing?",hi how i connect o3 to goggles pavo20 pro. first time fpv pls help
"Anything happened to the drone before this? Crash, attempted firmware flash etc?","not at all, I havent even flown this drone, this is my first build ever"
That's not a great sign.  Can you get me a pic of the ESC?. A 4in1 ESC board I'm guessing?,I have speedybee f405 V4 stack Ahhhhh.. You might have a DOA ESC. Gimme some pics so I can see the ESC though. Your vendor is going to want the same thing for the return if it is as I suspect. Check the FC to ESC connectors. For bent pins. And the cable for loose wires but the other 3 motors work perfectly fine A 4in1 ESC is literally 4 ESCs sharing one board. It's not that uncommon for one of them to be broken. But it's more common for the wires to be the problem
As above. The cable that links the ESC and FC needs checking as do it's connectors.. A failure there will create this outcome.. @50ShadowsOfBlack How you getting on?. Don't give me puzzles and then leave me hanging.... :p,"do i need to download elrs onto pavo20 pro. pls help. i cant conect to radiomaster pocket. what are these 2 It was loose and now it reads all 4, thank you One of the motors are not spinning now. @cyberFluke Go into ESC configurator with a lipo on, read settings, increase max from 1300 to 1350, write settings and try again. thx. It cant go any higher"
What options do you have in the motor timing dropdown box?,"i fixed it. thank you You're doing it again.. At least say what you did to ""fix"" it, so we know what has worked, to help others in the future. i gave it 20 seconds to get the motors spinning. then disarm and arm. fuck. I just crashed. and broke it https://tenor.com/view/no-words-speechless-dismay-gif-7582357 yea. its not turning on"
"https://tenor.com/view/awkward-stare-umm-jim-halpert-the-office-gif-3428167. Nothing when Lipo in, nothing when USB in?",usb is power. shows a light
does it connect to BF configurator?,"Yes, I fixed it. the solder was messed  up This is learning at it's most raw I guess. Press on, and good luck, for all our sakes :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
Do I need some type of heat shrink for this? It is: https://droneit.se/product/tbs-unify-pro32-hv-mmcx/,I've never seen anyone heatshrink it
"Excuse me?. Ah, you edited it.","You should get a warning message on the OSD telling you why it won't arm Nope, nothing its only specifically my 5” freestyle, everything else is fine. Havent had a clean arm with it in days Double check you have warnings visible on your OSD hello can anyone help me ihave problem with betaflight cant flash firmware its stuck and doesnt load"
what flight controller is it?,"download and run ImpulseRC Driver Fixer i did and cant search for its like keeps searching for it  fc so want to know its like usb problem i kinda tried like 5 different usb oh, the driver fixer can't do those properly yet I think. give me a second.

How bad is using a motor from a different brand then the other 3 motors i use?. Same kv etc,if it's the same size and kv it won't be noticeable
"Thanks. Vitroid,i have a question specificly to you. If you were going to build a volador 3.5 inch (digital) quad, would you make it 6s or 4s?","if I specifically was making it I'd go with 6s because I have the appropriate 6s batteries for a 6s 3.5"". other than that it makes more sense to go 4s. then again, 6s can be fun to not much detriment Okay, thanks for your time"
"Bare goggle, or accessories?","I'm not even sure you can buy them new anymore. They're decent enough, depending on the price let's say goggle with some antennas and such If it's the goggle plus receiver and antennas, for 150 quid I'd say that's a really nice deal"
"hold, goggle and receiver?. so the goggles dont come with receiver?","I mean, when one bought them new they came with Skyzone's receiver installed, but that can just as easily be removed/replaced, etc rh. eg. eh ffs. i'll just buy the skyzone cobra x v4 next paycheck I mean, I'm sure the seller would be able to confirm lol. For 150 that really is a good deal. IMO he says to give him an offer. i feel he prolly wont accept 150"
Have you considered buying the walksnail goggles l? There like $200 and you'd have a digital system which is way nicer (except for latency) then analog.,"My build is already on analog setup, i will go analog for sure Alright! Analog is nice aswell. I was just making sure you thought about it"
does someone know rubberquads email name?,"Not sure, contact them [here](<https://shop.rubberquads.com/pages/contact>) all good man, thanks also for the recommendation i need to send a picture tho. they said that they have a email but i cant find any info about it Me neither... Use that contact form to ask for their email Hi can someone help me please, have the nazgul XL5 ECO Elrs 2.4Ghz with the BLITZ 1.6W VTX and I only get like 300m of range before it starts to get really staticky which I thought seemed a bit weird since my previous drone which had a max output of 400mw could go 300 meters before getting really staticky as well and I tested them both at the same place with the same controller and goggles. And I did check to see if the VTX power light blinked 4 times and it did so it should have been at 1.6W. ngl they are really cheap ones but they worked decently well for me. They are the emax transponder 2 goggles linear antennas have quite a bit of loss when trying to receive from circularly polarized ones. on top of the receiver in that thing being really bad, it's not surprising"
"Raceband channel 8 and I tested it on raceband channel 4 aswell but they were pretty much the same. I guess, but how was I able to get the same range with the 400mw vtx?. I thought youd expect to get a bit further",400mW sounds a lot like a tinywhoop with a linear antenna. and the VRX still it was the tinyhawk 3 plus freestyle which I had before. which is why i still have those goggles
is this saying to put the capacitor in these 2 holes?,"I don't see any holes You can put it either in the little holes or parallel to main lead The little holes are there for the cap leads, so yes"
the cap goes between the negative and positive?,Yes but polarity matters so check that. So you don't blow it up you will quite literally have a violent explosion if you put the cap on backwards
long leg is negative right?,The colored side of the cap is negative
<https://youtu.be/rr7bPmGTQUk?t=25>,"If it's a black sheath, the negative will be white and marked with minuses which side is the colored side. lol"
does the solder look alright for the motors also ?,not to mention the esc itself going up in flames IMO you should try to shorten up the exposed wire element I could do but that would require resoldering of all 12 pads
If the polarity of the XT60 isn't reversed why would the ESC blow up?,"I don't actually know honestly, haven't thought about it much. but there's plenty pictures of it happening in here lol Yes it would. However, consider that a joint that is comprised of too much solder is actually going to be weaker and have more resistance. The way they are now will work, and IMO they aren't *egregious*"
"cool cool. so. it willb e. capacitor in first, then battery leads?",That's how I would do it I usually do it the other way around honestly I've never been able to get the cap in the tiny holes if I flood the pads for the main leads first :face_with_tears_of_joy: probably a skill issue lol that's what I always do
Could you provide a little more detail?,"i just bought a Nazgul5 V2, and i have a radiomaster pocket"
What have you tried so far?,plugging the battery in and out 3 times and binding on the express elrs thing
If there a bind button?,i see a boot button. idk what that means I think so:face_with_tears_of_joy: but I’m used to aio on tinywhoops Don’t press boot. That’s a whole different thing. I just looked it up If its brand new then it should be in bind mode every time you plug in a battery i bought it second hand but the dude who i bought it from still had his controller connected to show that it worked
"And is the controller and drone the same elrs, like 2.4ghz or 900mhz?","Just go through the process of adding a Bind phrase through the Web UI on both the receiver and the transmitter. Don't mess around with bind buttons that don't exist or trying the power off trick I'm going to take a guess that it probably needs to be updated That's also a good reason to look at the Web UI idk to be honest he put his own elrs module on it You should probably check that then because if they aren't the same then they won't be able to connect. We aren't talking about the version, we are talking about the frequencies the receiver and controller are on because if they aren't the same then they won't be able to bind"
What elrs frequency is the controller you are using?,"Ok, see if the receiver on the drone is also 2.4ghz I'd ask the guy you bought it from just to make sure. Cus it could be 900mhz what solder and tip are you using. that didn't flow at all and that means the pad is cold and/or not enough flux The joint on the right looks pretty good. The left one is serviceable but could be reflowed joint on the left was alright when i tinned the pad, left one gave me lots of trouble. put too much solder on, managed to get the wire to actually touch the pad just there so i said leave it at that. i will say it is about double the size in terms of height than the one on the right well like. you can do a pull test Pull on the wire. I would assume its rigid as hell. the wires and cap aren't going anywhere you can also do a swing test. Grab the drone by the pigtail and swing it in circles violently  # /s. /s means do not do that don't pull on the cap lol. that poor thing Give it a ""tug test"". Just, a nice little tug. If it doesn't move, it's fine. No yanking"
not going anywhere 100%. right. now the fc i guess?,:misc_nod_bugcat_slow:. but you can try and plug in the ESC first to see if that blows up do i need a smoke stopper
So once i plug in a battery will the motors just spin or will the esc light up or such?,"you will hear magical tunes. produced by the motors Which confused me so much of how they did that:face_with_tears_of_joy: Ik the motor precision is crazy ""switch warning"". mmm challenge accepted. what about ""welcome to edgetx"" Kids these days don't know about ""You're gonna learn something today"" Joshua Bardwell used to cold-open *every single video* with the concept and then ""I'm Joshua Bardwell, and you're gonna learn something today"" yes. i still dont understand :loudly_crying_face: thought he still does I thought he stopped for a while In fairness, I haven't watched Bardwell in a very long time Still does a lot of the time Well I guess I look silly does bardwell even make videos still smh I went to double check the phrase's exact wording so i clicked on whatever first video I found last upload was a few days ago was saddened when there was no ""learn something today"" nor intro music Yea he definitely dropped the intro video clip a long time ago actually a few hours ago last upload worth watching... 3 years ago"
https://tenor.com/view/growing-old-getting-old-grow-old-old-man-becoming-old-gif-17885988. i didn't even give that bardwell part a second thought when making that. what changed 3 years ago?,"no intro music = not worth watching. unfathomably based opinion Honestly I don't even really know how to answer. I think I just got to a point where I spent more time annoyed at his content than I found it helpful or informative. It felt like he always missed something important, or oversimplified in a way that was actually unhelpful, or just really wasn't that interesting anymore. And it's not like I just got bored of FPV, it was him specifically huh. that's too bad but understandable. tbh I haven't really followed his ""latest"" stuff, just binge watching PID filtering stuff long ago the old videos were def more interesting to watch idk why my family was a little concerned that I was spending my free time reading graphs :KEKw:"
maybe its just that you dont need him anymore? you know what i mean?,Yea that's probably it ascended to a state of higher knowledge etc i feel less bad for my soldering job I'm just scanning through the last year of uploads and there's nothing here that I don't know at all on my mob 7 now. :loudly_crying_face: you wont learn something today i guess my job was not bad. i used my old shitty android it was literally the worst soldering I have seen in months because my iphone was dead.

can anyone help me with my motors spinning the wrong way causing my drone to go into the ground?,reverse them in esc-configurator
is that in beta flight?,"no. It’s online, just look it up Ok so my 2nd and 4th motor are sinning good but the other 2 arent. spinning https://esc-configurator.com/ ik i found it. someone please help. i dont know whats happening and my drone wont take off"
what's up?. @Carrying the boats. I'll try to help. Can you send a vid?. What you have tried?,give me one second please ok so it started by me replacing the props and then it wouldnt take of so someone recomened to reverse the moter derection and now its just doing spins when i try to take of
Alright. Can you send a video?. Ill walk you through it. https://esc-configurator.com/. Go here.. And put a lipo in your drone. Then attatch the usb into the drone. Click connect. And then read in the bottom right. Then send a screenshot of that page,"Ok. Should look like this. Let me get on my pc. One sec. Max the minimum and maximum startup power Send a screenshot. Make ""RPM power protection"" 10x. and demag compensation. to high"

"I know the general advice for charging lipos is 1-2C, but does the same apply for LIION batteries? Should I be charging my 3500mah pack at 3.5A?",Check this out. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144575623315075164 It doesn't. some li ion cells can't be charged at 1C safely. you just have to check the specs specifically for yours. or buy only ones that can charge at 1c. it should say on the pack too I agree with emilia. I used li ion cells and i hated it. I stick to lipos. And its not safe to charge at the same rate as 1C oh fml it does say right on the pack. 1.75A charge. Just gotta use my eyes lol gang i need help where does the capacitor go ik it connects to the main power input place but in a tutorial they add wire and move it to the front is that needed or can i just directly solder it behind preferably you add it directly onto the pads with minimal wire or even leg. remember that capacitors are polarized and thus have a + and - side the longer stick is positive right I wouldn't rely on that. look at the markings on the capacitor oh lol. i didnt see those for most of these they'll have a whole white strip on the side with a bunch of `-`. which is negative of course
is what this guy did good?,yeah that's fine. you can do it in any way you like. just try to keep it to the max length of the capacitor legs. not any longer alr thank you. any tips to fix the soldering of the power cables. looks kinda ass
"I assume that flat spot on top of each cable's joint is from where a spike of solder had formed?. all of those look like either cold joints, or I think more likely, not enough flux (or alternatively, there was initially enough flux, but the iron was kept on the solder for long enough to burn off all the flux and lead to that overheated look",so if firmware is incompatible what is the worst that would happen
"Hey, I was wondering I want to slap a fpv camera onto my f1 rc car and I was wondering if this camera would be compatible with the current goggles I have?. https://www.amazon.com/AKK-5-8GHz-Transmitter-600TVL-Antenna/dp/B06XV7G439/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2T8ISCOTRS1SY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DutoOeEa8jX62uGQHOiEHJkblLbwf77bW0axblcdDLAbOltU8ClVLBlOQcM7HMqIiG9OhW-cLInTEvcQD0q4Ec09gIDLBkwdC5x0RtN6kV2y7if63fB_Oqce0kPiCMen0rHWet2Sl41yafZdVnnFntdZPk_hvsYfRYdB0ajZLr1NHdgC9jFmdKIrtxfWRytJFzJg-ZqPwvpAh4M93Z0cS2EcWrWueFH42vwEHvTfrSSFwPw2fhyqS6uZrkcCOxt3ujF5GtE_8eqtvCg2TaEsHcCrjVuY3vbc2qjA-oW3U1M.2WUU3e7DH42JitwVE_nGem6hSn_gziTCHmDqU2K7b_4&dib_tag=se&keywords=fpv+camera+and+transmitter&qid=1728098860&s=electronics&sprefix=fpv+camera+and+transmitter%2Celectronics%2C125&sr=1-6#customerReviews. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000134327513.html. Ty!",Im currently building my fpv drone. should i connect fc and esc and motors. and stop and do a smoke check. or should i just get the vtx and Rx on are you confident in your soldering
If it's incompatible for what ? Bidirectional dshot ?. Because DJI decided to use 5 wires,"Besides making it loose 0.6g (it's actually somewhat significant) it also reduces the resistance drastically so you get more power and flight time (the motor connectors we use are some ph2.0 3 pin, and there's a reason why we don't use ph2.0 for our battery connector anymore) the board on the M75 pro is absolutely microscopic, I will see if I can do it It's an f4 5a 1s, it's not really that small, only really annoying thing is the number of smd components right next to the plug, so if you go just brute force and try to remove the plugs with pliers you could break one off  And you can always just solder above the connectors and leave the board's connectors there"
I could always use hot air no?,"if you know how to use it without making every component next to it slide, then sure. you can also remove it with your soldering iron I could just set it to 100c, remove the plastic, then continue with the iron at the back. and then set the wires in place i'm not sure about how putting it at 100c will help you to remove the plastic"
"Hey guys, I was looking at the [GepRC Vapor X-5 O3](<https://geprc.com/product/geprc-vapor-x5-hd-o3-freestyle-fpv-drone>) and they claim 14-19 min flight time with a LiPo 1550mAh – 2200mAh. That seems waaaay to high. Is it true you can get these times or they're just lying basically?. Even iFlight claim 7.5 minute hover time for their Nazgul Eco which is similarly specced","Yep. You *might* get to around 15 mins with *very* gentle cruising, with the right props and the largest LiPo it'll conceivably carry.. But those are pie in the sky numbers, for sure."
So for regular freestyle with a 1600mAh and a Action 4 I would get around 5 min max?,"Give or take, yeah. You could extend that by shedding mass, obvs. but that always comes at a cost. Nothing in engineering is free.. Most of the mass on a quad like that adds durability, for example."
Still just green after 1min. 3 Times trying to give it power. Dont the crux35 elrs have wifi commect?,"Let me check, for wifi you don't need to give it power 3 times"
Have you applied it after updating?,that´s the old cli. now i saved and loaded old. cant seem to find elrs wifi from the drone
cant i see the reciver in the cli status tab?,"Interesting, so it seems to be serial based according to the ports tab. But then on the receiver tab the protocol should be set to CRSF and not SBUS board_name CRAZYBEEF4DX And telemetry should be on. Ok yes this is serial based, good. But the receiver protocol should be set to CRSF in the receiver tab"
"Oh wait, there's a caveat, it seems like this board is 900Mhz ELRS. Do you have a 900Mhz transmitter module?","hmm so the drone might be 900Mhz. radio is the zorro elrs Yes, it is 900Mhz. That's 2.4Ghz yee, so i might seem to be a quite big problem It's rare to see 900Mhz in bind-and-flys nowadays we´re trying with ""newly"" bought drone. so probably we just orderd the wrong one then You don't need a new radio, you need a transmitter module that you can put on the back of the radio 900mhz instead of 2.4 But this is strange, because on the happymodel page they say 2.4 Should ve 2.4. Should be right then"
So we did connect to TX via wifi and added bindingphrase. do i need battery or just fine with usb cable?,"USB cable should be fine. But don't power it 3 times quickly, just one time and leave it. Just plug it in normally. But don't connect to betaflight Ok, let's wait for 1-2 minutes and see if wifi appears"
should the light be constant green?. i saw in manual that it should double flash?,"Not sure, that might be the flight controller light, not ELRS light. But it should blink slowly, and then start to blink fast when it goes into Wifi still blinking slowly"
"Wait a bit more. Ok, is it still blinking slowly?","receiver status led is solid. this ""red"" one is blinking slowly"
"Ok, can you send me the listing where you bought the drone from?",That's what I'm trying to figure out

Integrated ExpressLRS SPI receiver or Frsky SPI D8/D16 receiver. ?,You don't have SPI receiver. You have UART ELRS receiver
hmm that means?. where did you see that?,You have the V2. Here it says they switched to UART
The new ELRS V2 version comes with CrazyF411 ELRS AIO flight controller built-in UART ExpressLRS receiver.. exactly. so just usb to elrs program then?. not wifi?,"Well, yes. But the issue now is that your ELRS is stuck in bootloader, we have to fix this, but I'm not sure which ELRS target we need to flash"
should i impulse rc and then update again in betaflight?,"No it's not betaflight. At this point betaflight is fine. It's the ELRS part yea ok. cant seem to find wich ""Device"" i should have Yeah, probably it's this. But I can't say for sure"
since it´s stuck it wont make it worse by trying?. wher did u find that one?. updating elrs,"Ok, once done, unplug and plug back in your usb. And see if it starts blinking"
then i need to use latest. then i might need to update radio aswell. since it´s 3.3.1?,If they're both on v3+ they should bind

Make sure to pay attention to that too Just re-flash the transmitter and receiver to the latest version. And add binding phrase. Makes life so easy Why do FrSky receivers have their bind buttons planted inside the cover. Why not just make it like. A regular bulging button I guess no, not on a 1s whoop"
"Why does my Rm Boxer say this when i try and load my model for mob6? Also, any help with binding them would be appreciated.",Why does davinci give me this after I try to import videos from my avata 2 H.265 is not supported by default. You'll need this https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nmzlz57r3t7
what should I change it to because h.265 or any other codec isnt supported. davinci can work with this too?,"Yes I'm pretty sure. H264 is supported by default on all platforms. But I don't know if avata supports H264 on 60FPS, just get the codec it's $1 ye imma try. thanks for telling me, I will see if it worked"

"Like, it's corrupted or what?. Yes, use EdgeTX buddy to reflash firmware and SD card contents. <https://buddy.edgetx.org/#/sdcard>",Thankyou:folded_hands: :folded_hands: davinci couldnt use it without the extension you told me to get. bro cooking with all the help today :chefkiss:
"Oh ok, so now it works, right?. When were you on Mallorca? Where did you fly?","ohh quite a few places. if you want we can talk in dms its easier and we wont fill up this chat Ok, sounds good :slightly_smiling_face: It doesnt allow me to reflash it The radio should be off but plugged into USB"
Ohh. @Yaros if i do this does it go back to factory settings?. Cause i kinda messed it up last night,"Hmm not sure, if I have time I'll try to find an SD Card dump of defaults"

"hmmm. when you make a new model, does it prompt you to select the craft type?",no. no craft selection Wiped all settings from SD and downloaded new and replaced... Still no diffrence You can't just find RUD in Mixes if it isn't in Inputs. You have to set the stick itself up in the Inputs page first
"I have -5 drift on my roll, and -1 on my yaw on the RM Pocket, why?. Trims are centered","Yep. Though I did notice, when I calibrate, after a use or two, it goes back to the same"
does anyone know the name of the connector thats on the radiomaster boxer liion holder? i wanna be able to charge these things faster. i just need an adapter for it,Cant get any reaction in inputs either Can you send a video of what you guys are trying IMO i just charge my radio overnight.... Drone  getting eta but no R
"It's whatever balance leads are. If you swap that box out for a LiPo the radio runs off the balance lead, see?.. You can make the box charge like a 2s pack by splicing an xt30 connector into that balance lead. (Or make an adapter that is basically a balance lead extension with said xt30 spliced in as above)",my gimbal movements arent recognized in betaflight. im using the radiomaster pocket
"i’m looking to upgrade to HD and have decided to go the walksnail path, should i get the goggles L or are there better options?",goggles X are good end-game goggles :misc_nod_bugcat_slow:
Aren't Lava 550's (BT2.0) basically the same batteries shipped with the meteor line up? They're both BetaFPV,Yo does anyone know how i can get my tools back. My dad accidentally downloaded the files for the tx16 onto my boxer when trying to flash it and everything is messed up. Lol It's all on the official guide that you should follow for EdgeTX Oh. Right. Ok ill look again. It doesn’t say anything about a factory reset yes you just flash it. factory reset doesn't exist
Do you possibly have the link to flash it with?. Or is it in the manual,"<https://manual.edgetx.org/installing-and-updating-edgetx/update-from-opentx-to-edgetx-1> in the FAQ read the 1s batteries thing, first sentence. lava cells are greprow/tattu cells and are folded. the blue betafpv cells are complete garbage and not worth using really. like they work but you're losing flight time and all that"
Not even temporarily while I get Lava batteries?,well yeah of course temporarily. just expect to be amazed at the new ones Anything for mods on this its the syma z4w

what is that? so i can check,it doesn't. and it doesn't matter for you I think
so should i get the radiomaster?,it comes with better antennas so sure. and bigger pads so easier to solder

Alright confirmed im an idiot we good"
What are you using then?,"where can i find preset tunes for a 3"" In the betaflight presets tab ardupilot. tweaks tf out so i might just throw a trash tune and autotune it"
True.. Can you help with my question?. ^. I enabled OSD in betaflight. I dont see any OSD in my goggles tho,"I enabled osd to my drone. I don't see it in betaflight.. 1.. None of those batteries..

Ill just get a O3 With soldering, don't rush Yea not to long but also not to short ----  I'm a little confused, I've got two 3 position switches on my Pocket, thing is, I am using one for flight modes and I'm confused on what to use the other one for. including that one button in the corner too I can't bind my Crux3 to my radiomaster pocket. I already connected it once. but it's not connecting now"
Or use a blowtorch... :grimacing_face:. What temp was the iron set to? Surface of the sun?,"### And I also highly recommend not using a piece of the earth's core. Too high. And held waaaay to long. It's honestly impressive that you managed that with only 370°c With good solder and flux, 320C is more than sufficient."
Trying to cook steak?,"For small scale stuff, I work at 290C, to give you an idea. Oh :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: Use low melt solder and lower temps than steak in a grill.  I prefer 275c with 183c solder. So, yeah. That ESC is about done. It may be repairable given enough time, patience, and the right tools, but as it is... :Harold: Thats not a ESC thats a Air Unit Again. With time and tools though... Shame I'm in the UK, I'd have had a pop at cleaning it up for you.. That might be salvageable you know.. Get a fibreglass pencil.. Gently gently over the pads to get the burnt detritus off. If you want i can send it to you. i would pay shipping Not stupid. Inexperienced, ignorant maybe. Both can be cured with education and assistance, we can do that here. :yellow_heart: I mean all they really need is the power lines and thoose I'm sure could be injected elsewhere.. Probably salvageable in one way or another. Definitely, just a matter of how far you're willing to go. definitelybut i im to inexperienced"
"If you have no other options and are willing to pay shipping, I am willing to have a go at cleaning it up for you. :yellow_heart:. A local ""makerspace"" might be a cheaper and quicker option though?",Yeah or a cellphone ETC repair shop may be willing to take a crack at it. That's not a bad plan either. Just need the pads cleaning up and/or conductors soldering to the pad endpoints. The repair shops in germany do a sloppy job
"Can you get me a few more pics of the thing, so I can see what's what a little better please?","jup can do but give me a sec No rush, ping me when you post em :slightly_smiling_face:"
"It's starting to get on my nerves. I messed up, okay, it happens to everyone, but does everyone have to make fun of it now?","Nothing to be ashamed about, you should've seen my first solder joints. My god, would've given someone a heart attack Thanks, but 180€ down the drain still hurts. I get it, things happen, but it's hard to laugh about it right now. banned in the EU. only lead free solder Lead free will still work fine, just a little harder to work with. You also dont get shiny ballz.. On the upside its not toxic I shouldn't be sharing this with you, but I dug up this 63/37 solder from the depth of the european black market, use it wisely https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/tbs-etain-100g-08mm-6318.html Thanks but i wont work with toxic lead solder it's not toxic tho. it takes a couple extra thousand degree celcius to have lead fumes"
"Hi, so im setting up my radio again, what should i select here, surface or EU?. Or air","Literally just have airflow at your workstation and you don’t have to worry about solder fumes well it's flux fumes that you will get, not solder fumes, much less bad, but you have it with both leaded and unleaded"
Do you want to fly with or against the law?,if you fly EU you are limited to 100mW I guess i should probably play it safe being a naughty boy and blasting 1w. because litterally no one will care
What does it mean by limiting mW? Like how powerful my drone is or the range of the radio?,"how powerfull the signal is and really tho, no one cares. you can blast 1w if you want to, so long as you are not litterally showing your radio into a police officer's face it's fine Uk. Police suck here. Theyd definitely confiscate it just fly in a field where there isn't people around. if you aren't bothering anyone, no one will care"
do you live near a airport?,so you wont go up to 1W
"looking for a 65mm prebuilt, should i get the hummingbird v3?","About 1 and a half km absolutely not, newbeedrone bnf are crappy and overweight, look at the air65 if you want an analog 65mm alr thanks. i’ll take a look it's fine then, but again, if you want to fly anything outside of a whoop or a micro, you should go fly in a field anyway Ye lol i aint the best pilot at the moment well then again, people won't care as long as you don't bother people, all you need to do is fly safely sorry to break it to you but you arent even allowed to fly there Ye thx for the help with the firmware. Im sure a 5” wont do too much damage lmao. Jk Since March 2019, the UK has expanded the no-fly zone around airports. This area consists of two main parts:      A cylindrical zone with a radius of 5 kilometers (3 miles) around the airport’s runways.     An extended zone along the runways, stretching 5 kilometers in both directions from the ends of the runway. This zone is 1 kilometer wide (500 meters on either side of the runway)."
do you think they will care if he flies a 65mm in his backyard ?,"And a whoop. I got a few drones well, for the miniquads, just go fly in a field, for the whoops and micros you can fly in your backyard without any issues I mean, you can fly your 5"" there if your neighbors are deaf, and you don't fly stupidly high"
----------  @cyberFluke  did you see the pictures?,"Was busy with other things, but yes. Just having a look now.. The problem I'd have in having a shot at repairing it is that I'd have no way of testing it. I fly Walksnail myself.. I don't have anyone to fly with here in Sheffield, let alone someone with DJI goggles to check it's working as it should :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: (regarding your solder question, I use 63/37 flux cored solder. Last stuff I bought was actually TBS branded, as it was cheapish. Turns out, it's actually really good stuff.) yeah I linked him some tbs solder already Get a fibreglass pencil and gently go over the pads to clear away the debris. I reckon there's still enough there to solder on.. I would get some of that TBS solder too. It's easy to work with, far more so than lead free stuff. The lead free stuff is tricky to work with even for an experienced technician.. It's not going to harm you in the quantity you're using."
"Hey guys, ive done all of the reseting stuff and it STILL gives me this loading screen. The only thing i couldnt install was the firmware, that kept giving me an error.

do anyone know what model of transmitter is compatible with fatshark dominator hdo3?,thx. got a good deal on them so now looking for a transmitter to pair it with got them for like 400 bucks still in box never used Ehm. New their cheaper i aproximated. did not pay usd. it was around 4k sek so. let me check. 385 with 4 antennae that is still a bad deal i'll go back on the deal. i have't promised i'll buy them I would honestly be picking up either the Goggles Lite or the Goggles X at this point are there dji 03 alternatives that fit in pevo 20 pro probably better to do a banggood purchase Now that i know you havent got them i can tell you that those goggles are bad Get the proper goggles x or use the goggles l (like me). Goggles l are $200. And their so nice. Yeh watch some reviews 459 on caddxfpv. i have watched some and they seem alright
For the goggles x?. Or l,I was not recommended them
Here. https://caddxfpv.com/products/walksnail-avatar-hd-goggles-l?srsltid=AfmBOopZAnyrUDELGzY7h_W6OVtlBd0MmqPFvuE8tfaS8j5krB9P6gPY. Why not get these?. Or do a buy once cry once and get the goggles x,"i have tried a friends box goggles and they don't balance nice on head. don't remember what ones he has ev800d. and they aren't comparable in the slightest These are wayyyyy better. And shorter. Sometimes they hurt my nose though the hdo's are just a bit outdated, they are the first generation walksnail stuff"
will this setup be flyable?,"Asinine that they're listed as HDO3 yeah disgusting and misleading. but that's the fatshark way now i guess * don't get a stack for a 2"" * don't get crappy cheap motors * don't get crappy unsupported ELRS receivers the apex frame only supports stacks then don't get it. and get an actual original frame"
is the info on their website false?,"the actual ImpulseRC Apex was never made as a 2"" design. someone took the name and basic shape and smooshed it down to 2"" size. I quite like this one https://www.rotorama.cz/product/alfarc-cub-aio-88mm-2 fatshark makes analog goggles and they name them all very similarly, so when you randomly name the next one (which looks the exact same) as a continuation and randomly have it be walksnail. it's misleading yeah that's very misleading"
and are there any motors from aliexpress worth buying?,they should have made another name for them a lot of good motors from good manufacturers can be bought from aliexpress they name literally all their goggles the same thing and a lot of them also just are the same thing. they've basically ruined their image with their dumb naming their marketing team might not exist @cyberFluke I'm having trouble binding my crux3 to my radiomaster pocket or be severly incompetent it's incompetence sadly lol. they've been overtaken for a while by other companies but they don't make anything new. feature or whatever wise. but they do keep releasing new goggles. their newest being `HDO+`
Did you update your radio and reciever recently?,i cant find any good ones for 1s If not then do that first tbh
I don't think so?. How do I update it?,#youtube. #joshuabardwell for a heavier frame like that I probably wouldn't go 1s. and the speedybee stack can't even do 1s
"do you have it?. ough yikes. I dont understand how you couldnt have known that you didnt need it honestly, wasnt it listed on the job application?","Can anyone help me  I need cinewoop kit but I can't find out which one of the vtx should I use to connect to my DJI v1 goggles and my DJI fpv controller At most the original air unit or the Vista (air unit lite). The V1 goggles do not work with the O3 air unit I think. And it's best to use a proper radio with an internal ELRS transmitter module, not the DJI radio but i dont want it to be a rc brick ah im just gonna buy the bassline frame i guess Does pnp work with dji @JefFPV (AUTEL Pilled). it genuinely sounds like you've screwed over the company, and you are 100% in legal trouble @Buster9pcj Also please fix your profile, otherwise you won't be here for long. I hope I don't have to explain why. If you're gonna spew nazi slogans then at least spell it properly"
"idk. the ant nano is a 14mm camera, right?","8500kv is pretty low for 2"" 2s"
theyre 11000kv. also what batteries should i get?,"I would get the lava 2s 450mah for a 2"" 2s"
If I were to change out the motors would it then fly good ?,"Hi I wanted to ask if it is an good idea to turn an crux35 into an volador vx3 Not really, the crux35 uses 3500kv motors, which is a good choice for a light 3.5"", but for a 3"" that's really low, 3800-4600kv is what's usually used for a 3"" at that point its cheaper to just build from scratch or just stick with the crux35. you can probably get a different 3/3.5"" toothpick frame if you dont like the crux one Not really, as others have explained.  The Crux35 is a great little drone (I have one myself), but a freestyle machine it isn't.  The Volador is a freestyle frame, heavier than what the crux's parts will comfortably haul around.  I'd also recommend the VX3.5 over the VX3. The extra half inch makes all the difference :winking_face: Is it possible to build a 6s 2 inch indoor cinewhoop. I find 3s too less power"
Is the TBS UNIFY PRO32 legal in sweden / europe?. Or do I need to set it up somehow for it to be,"Someone did, but it just created a chonky potato (I didn't see it fly, but it is a pretty bad idea, just makes a chonk) But you could always just go to a bigger plateform and not just try to slap 6s on"
"No the prebuilt version uses 1504 motor  4600kv. These are 4s only.. Quick query regarding props and tune for those tune gods in here!.  The drone is my Betafpv PAVO25 V2 (the BNF version) not my own build. I run these props on it GF D63 3-Blade and the tune that comes from  BETAFPV. No issues and the motors are STONE COLD!!! after a flight.  Today I tried using the GF D63 5-Blade props on the drone. It had wobble through out the flight, not major but in certain point of the flight hard to control. At the end of the flight the motors were fucking H          O        T!!!!.   I never knew that changing the props would do this.   Attached is a image of the tune that BETAFPV have done. Would it be the master multiplier that would reaslistically need to come down a bit on the 5 blade?",can i use 6s on pavo25 I am in the process of building a 6s pavo 25 v2. Literally got all the parts. Just waiting for time to make it i mean the prebuilt. also on edge tx how to make it say airmode off. and airmode on. i cant find it in tracks
I have whatever comes with it. Do you think i need to flash it to be able to bind to my radiomaster pocket?,"The Mobula 7 has an SPI ELRS receiver, which means the ELRS major version that it uses (2.x or 3.x) is dependent on the version of Betaflight you have flashed on the flight controller If all of this stuff is new to you, it's a very good idea to go through everything and make sure it is on the latest version. EdgeTX for your radio controller, ELRS on your transmitter module (internal in the radio), Betaflight (and ELRS in this case) on the flight controller yeah, i agree. I built a 5 inch, but i wanted something smaller to fly in tight spaces lol. i guess i'll flash it then Once Betaflight is on the latest version (4.5 has ELRS 3.x built-in) and your Pocket is also running ELRS 3.x (3.5.1 is current latest), you will be able to bind them together"
"ok. also, will it keep the tune when i flash it, or should i use the preset i saved?. also, should I full chip erase or not?",I generally don't unless I have an issue. It will not
"Is it a preset tune or a custom tune that you did?. Either way, you should do a CLI dump before you flash so that you can restore your other settings","it is a preset tune. i just got it yesterday and i'm trying to bind it. both preset and cli dump has been saved Happymodel probably has a published cli dump anyway. I don't apply presets to BNF builds, the manufacturer normally makes a tune for them"
"saw the grey goo after a crash today, how big of a problem is it?","if it's a solid, then I wanna say it's just some glue for securing the coils. it *doesn't* look like some piece of plastic just got lodged in there. looks like it was intentionally applied as a liquid glue Yeah I don't see how it would have gotten into the windings like that in a crash @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) my crux3 is not working. 1 of the motors are not spinning"
Didn't we go over why you shouldn't just ping people whenever you need help like 20 times and not later than last week ?,"heres some other photo, it looks like its leaking"
Liquid or solid? :KEKw:,"If it's liquid, please don't do that with your motors Try spinning it individualy in betaflight. And listen. Does it 'try' to spin or does it just do nothing at all yeah if it's solid and interlaced with the coils, it's likely just some manufacturing glue, unless you got glue on the motors at some point. either way unlikely to happen due to a crash"
Does it beep when you plugthe quad in? Hold the motor and feel if it vibrates when plugging in,It's there on purpose. Carry on. :yellow_heart: my usb port broke off :loudly_crying_face:. what do i do
It doesnt beep when he plugs quad in so yeah. That means zero power to that motor no?,"Motor or esc is fucked cry and either hope you will never need to use betaflight ever again, or try to solder it back on or he just doesn't have enough startup power Just maybe reflash ur esc or maybe something is blocking the motor by changing the esc settings"
does he have lights that turn on ?,"It does. Just checked. Yes. Only 1 motor is not working The motors make the beep sound so u wanna feel if the broken motor beeps/vibrates. If it does its atleast getting power well, go on esc-configurator, bump startup min power by 10, check if the motor spins when you arm, then try again until it spins you should also reflash your esc before trying that, doesn't cost anything to try iirc the x12 already has bluejay on. flash bluejay 0.2.1 at 48khz"
ty. And any tips on how to get good range with your goggles to your drone?. And your radio to drone?,"not having stuff between you and the drone, and using decent antennas and vtxs"
What antenna do you reccomend for EV800D?,yeah i just set my rates but and my switches but this shit is so annoying
"the ev800d's receiver will be the bottleneck, it just sucks, but you can get a singularity and a truerc x-air/x2-air. is it from a speedybee fc ?. yeah, then close, try to arm, check if it spins, if it does, problem is fixed, if it doesn't, then start over","iflight. i tried to solder it on but the solder was litteraly not sticking, idk why because they usually use shit lead free solder on smd components. then read my message again. no need to keep it spinning like this and just stare at the motor that doesn't spin, just try to arm it, see if it spins, if it doesn't, bump the startup power a touch"
"Ok, thanks. Can I put the startup power to max?","if only you could actually read my messages until the end I just bumped the startup power. I did that. I just did not say that ok, then just repeat until it works"
you think that will make it work?,I have been litterally repeating myself like 5 times now ok. i'll try again. still not
"My steadyview gets dangerously hot with a battery pack (2S) on my cobras, why??. It's literally almost too hot to touch. I almost got burnt, I'm even thinking of making a 1s3p pack",because it likes to be hot not really. the steadyview just runs really hot. just keep trying until you either get to the maximum in which case either your motor or esc is fucked or it spins again Why does my radiomaster pocket lose battery faster then its charge when it is not in idle mode because it outputting signal which takes up alot of power.
controller not having channels/mixes set up correctly? does it work on another one?,likely an issue in your transmitter itself. yeah ^ in some transmitters you need to setup which outputs are what switches i'm not sure. it works fine on my 5 inch
Did you not just have an entire thread dedicated to fixing this?,that was for binding lol. i made a copy of my old profile and that fixed the switch problem so please disregard that question. thanks for the help earlier lol
"I'm looking to replace the GPS module on my foldape4 (4"" sub-250 long range) and I'm seeing a lot of people attach their GPS module to the battery strap. I haven't seen it before but it *seems* like a much better spot. Are there nay big downsides to mounting it there? Or is at the back under the VTX antenna going to be smoother going? Will it even be a noticeable difference?","imo the battery strap location is more likely to get damaged. I put mine under the VTX antennas. Granted, the VTX creates a lot of interference so I have a way to power up and warm up the gps before I turn on the quad. after the gps has satellites locked, you can power up the vtx and it's fine. youre going to get more vtx interference with that sort of mounting, but imo it doesn't really matter if youre going to warm up the gps first anyways. I do that because the vtx makes intereference no matter what, but ive heard varying opinions on it strap mounting should easily give you 25 sats even on M8 units. just don't land on its back"
how do people do the wiring though?,just run it down along the strap. that should be right above the stack anyway maybe i could make it with a plug so i can take it off for freestyle. that would be cool right. there are FCs with plugs
"For what, trying to see what drones are in the airspace around you?",To make sure I don't get into collisions for fully-automated flights. I'm working with the city fire dept What you're asking for does not exist for drones yet.
"well, for some (most?) you can get Aeroscope","Aeroscope only works for some DJI drones, AFAIK. A Remote ID receiver would be the best way to go, but a see-and-avoid implementation would be needed and some others. and DJI drones are the vast majority of what you'll encounter in a city @meow you also need to be aware that not all full-scale aircraft have ADS-B out, and if you want to have any hope of avoiding the ones that do you'll need an ADS-B In capability. But not all aircraft have ADS-B Out, so you can't even detect them autonomously. Be advised that fully autonomous flight is completely illegal without extra super special permission from the FAA. The waiver application you would have to submit would be... extensive. Ah, so some dynamic object collision will always be necessary ~_~ The FAA does not consider collisions to be necessary. They actually would like you to avoid them. You should spend a *lot* of time reviewing the existing regulations. And studying for a Part 107 certificate It will be the fire dept piloting the drones, I'm assuming they have that down"
so can i use this for analog camera also?,"no, analog VTX's are wired differently than digital VTX's"
"Is it normal my quad (Meteor 85) gets hot just by having connected the battery, even without doing anything with it?","There is no guarantee that anything will use the same connector, you need to be prepared to solder. analog VTXs do not get connected to a UART the same way a Vista does i genuinely cannot find a good high quality picture of the diagram. soldering is ok but I am confused on what wires would go where"
Not even this giant one on Skystar's website? https://skystars-rc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/F405HD2-KO45-BLS-spec.png,Yup. The VTX produces a lot of heat and relies on the airflow of the drone in flight for cooling. If left for too long it's possible to burn it out oh. it's a nice vector graphic as well. how lovely
"So the camera will wire to these here ports regardless it seems, right?","Yes, an analog camera must send its video signal into that CAM pad. No other option, unless you skip the FC entirely and wire it straight to the VTX.  But if you do that you don't get any OSD. It depends on a lot of factors. The beeping is likely a Core Temp Too High warning that you'll see on the vtx. It will usually throttle/shut itself down before doing any damage, but it's possible after probably around 5-10 minutes. seems like the video, gnd and 5v will need to be soldered to the fc I just successfully tested it with my goggles for the first time, what a relief, the camera still works perfectly. Thanks for the reassurance"
what does this warning thing mean?,watch out what voltage you're putting on it or something. who knows
Is that different on smaller drones? My tinywhoop the camera goes straight to the VTX but I still get osd,"On AIOs where the VTX is integrated into the board, the camera signal is still routed through the OSD chipset before it goes to the VTX chipset I have an external vtx, it has five wires coming from the FC on one side, three wires from the camera on the other In some cases the VTX wiring actually has a CAM passthrough to pass the camera signal back to the FC before it comes back into the VTX Oh ok. That makes sense It's weird and dumb, but it does simplify wiring a bit on tiny builds how would you connect this RX - TX TX - RX 5V - 5V GND - GND"
with pins or something? and the ep1 board just hanging over like that sort of?,"@TheOneThatFlies you could use pins i guess but I would just add some wires... Unless you're going for the smallest build possible, don't do it like this... it will break sooner than later use wires and twist em"
"so my vtx has smartaudio, I guess this would connect on the fc to the tx6 port here?",and obviously 5v in i would use the 5v instead of the 10. straight forward stuff rush tiny tank. a bit underpowered for the size of this fucking thing but yeah that one is 5V iirc now my dilemma. do i connect cam. or do i connect vtx. if my camera will be hooked up to the fc VIDEO-CAM just passes through the VTX. the VTX just acts as an extension wire for the camera in this setup
"so in that case, if my camera is connected to the fc only and not the vtx, i would use the video-vtx option?",just to make a visual explanation:
failsafe means that it lost signal. HMM. I wonder about something. What ELRS region did you flash? @milo. ISM or EU?,"in Betaflight, go to CLI tab. send this command:  get expresslrs. and post the result here. > set expresslrs_domain=CE2400 > save @milo not in that way. i guess everyone EU or not tends to just flash ISM here, all the time yeah I forgor about that. back when we were dealing with the whole thing. it was almost 2AM >.> save is a command @milo where did I write /. in CLI, send these two commands:  set expresslrs_domain=CE2400 save @milo Alright done it. Thanks code blocks are forgotten I had some trouble with how discord copies from them and into BF CLI. in some cases the line ends got stripped. so I stopped using them so wack. haven't had that before"
Can i use flux paste instead of flux pen ? Sorry noob question,a flux pen just contains flux in a liquid form. a flux paste is flux... in paste form. you care about it doing the job of being flux. not as much about its consistency. so use it :slightly_smiling_face:
what kind of flux exactly did you get?. can you show your BF Modes tab (with Hide unused selected). and Receiver tab (wanna see the right side),I havent gotten any but nearby hardware stores only offer flux in paste form usually it's more convenient to get it in a syringe or similar form. if available tho Ok ill look around thank you very much make sure it is no-clean flux. because this looks suspiciously like something that isn't. let alone for soldering
@storex10 which tutorial told you to use flux? cause with correct form and resin cored solder it's a crutch and shouldn't be neccesary for general jobs,"@milo tag me when you respond. flux is helpful especially if you can't find great solder.... which can be a bit challenging nowadays in the US you can find mg chemicals and kester solder just straight on Amazon yeah, that's why i said it's a crutch. helpfull but will lead to wonky form and in the EU you can find TBS solder and some others, but stuff usable for electronics is just not carried by general electronics/hobby/hardware stores anymore there's a few countries that have mg chemicals on amazon. then there's specific webshops. and there's always mouser/digikey/farnell/reichelt/whatever that'll carry similar stuff too. it is doable but way harder i guess"
aight. @milo what phone have you got? Android or iPhone or other?. cause you can use an Android phone with a USB adapter :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: (or even just a USB-C hub),Ill get back to you tomorrow as the pc is in use for the rest of the evening Ive been using the same cup of brazing pipe flux for half a decade lmao Im on iPhone unfortunately. But wow its so difficult to fly a the whoop. Ironically more difficult than the 5”
"Less mass, less momentum. Makes for a twitchy machine, doesn't it?",Yea very drifty aswell. Found myself using the flip-back-over mode alot Turtle mode. Yeah.. Careful doing that with cheap AIOs. You can melt ESCs if you're not careful I’m kinda new to fpv and I wondering if I were to buy a pre built drone with DJI 03 would I be able to connect it to a DJI  rc
Which remote?. Theres a few different,I believe v2 the one that comes with the DJI FPV Yea that should be fine Unless they have made a different rc Yea the v2 was made partially for the o3
Maybe?  Depends how overspec the FETs are. :PepeShrug:,Ehh future me can deal with that. For now i shall enjoy unlimited flips
"But why not use 3.5"" props?. You already have a big pile of 3"" spares or something?","volador3.5 it is then, thanks!"
"Guys, ‏do you thin its a problem that there is a difference between each cells in the battery? (And im not talking about a 0.1v difference)","Especially since 3"" is a lot smaller than 3.5"", 3.5"" is 30% bigger (in surface area, which is what matters)"
Is radiomaster pocket supported for liftoff? Can not find it here: https://www.liftoff-game.com/support?topic=3&category=1&post=44,yes. any modern radio is supported by any modern simulator
"How do I use pit mode, and 10v?. And what does Non inverted signal mean?",That's fine after a flight. It would be mildly concerning if it was a full battery and you had some cells that discharged themselves a couple .1v away from 4.2v
are you using a FRSKY receiver?,"then it's not relevant for you. as for the VTX, based on how the solder bridges are soldered, you can enable or bypass real PIT mode. with real pit being a on/off switch for the VTX power. usually controlled by some USER mode in BF"
"for 10V - you either bridge it to 10V or the other voltage (too low of a resolution, can t tell). ""that""?","sorry, I did mean PIT Mode yes but which part of it. first, there is a solder bridge which lets you pick between A) switchable power (real pit functionality)  B) constant power. second, there is a solder bridge which lets you pick between A) 10V B) idk, can't read it"
"""idk, can't read it"", do you mean the text on the image?","yes. it's kinda hard to tell the numbers in the 5 pixels :KEKw:. If you have switchable power enabled, then you need to configure it in BF as per the board manufacturer's instructions.  Sometimes it's pre-configured in the BF target, other times not.  It will appear as a ""USER"" mode in Modes tab. - ""Frsky, SBUS&SPORT Non inverted signal is needed when connecting S.port on UART-TX"" - ""Use pit mode for VTX, USE 10V for +VTX"" that is the text on the image I can't tell what the other voltage is. and honestly I don't care what it is either :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. I'm just telling you that it gives you a choice. up to you what you do with that. I guess that it's 5V. but that's just a guess.. btw ""Use pit mode for VTX, USE 10V for +VTX""  This isn't a command, telling you what to do. it's information about what the pads allow you to do. (very bad english)"
"""Pit von 5V 10V"" - https://skystars-rc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/F7miniHDpro-spec-scaled.jpg. What do you mean with ""solder bridge""?","there are 3 pads next to each other  How you connect them (with solder) determines what happens ```   10V  +VTX  5V     []  []  []  (not connected at all, no power to +VTX)     [====]  []  (10V going to the VTX)     []  [====]  (5V going to the VTX) ```. @wilmer. I have the 5V and 10V swapped in my example (if you look it with correct text orientation)"
"Okay, but is this only for the V and the other ones for the PIT mode?",The principle is the same
?. my example shows all 3 variants,"as I said, my example has 5V and 10V swapped compared to the image. the image is set to 10V. since 10V is bridged to the middle pad Hello, I am looking for a hack for mavic pro to be able to ignore NFZ Sorry buddy, you won't find that here."
"mobula6, mobula6 2024, meteor65, meteor65 pro or air65?",yea I have 15 sets of them :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: Meteor 65 Pro or Air65
can you tell me why?. im just curious,"The Air65 is lighter, and both have a serial ELRS receiver instead of SPI The Pro has more power than the Mobula im gonna get the air65 Lawl, fair nuff.  Means you can afford to be a bit rough, have a pop at some moves you wouldn't try usually :yellow_heart: hello my friends i have a problem flashin my ESCs because they need BLHELI 32 that their servers are down what can i do Not much with BLHeli_32. You'd need to flash AM32 if you want to do anything newer with the ESC at https://esc-configurator.com/ it says failed read esc 1,2,3,4 esc-configurator doesn't do BLHELI32. you need a specific configurator for it. or go through the process of flashing it to AM32"
Is it okay for my battery connector to be held like this?,my motors reach maximum speed while my throttle is only at middle
no not really. with props on?,how else cound i mount it then I assume you don't want to shorten the lead coming from the ESC. so turn the battery around and have them connect on the side under the straps Don't exactly know how to do that with how long it is from the esc no like. flip it the other way around. leads pointed to the front
"Hello everyone, I don't know much about drones, but I have a GoPro and I would like to film with the GoPro mounted on a drone. Is that possible? Do you know which drone I should buy?","take the battery, then flip it so that the battery leads point to the front of the drone I always do, that’s the main reason I have so many :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. Keep snapping them all yeah but preferably on the side. don't have a better picture lol yea facing the battery forward wont exactly allow the cables to fit, just the way the iflight has this thing routed, i cant get it close enough so it literally isn't long enough to do this nope. not without pushing the battery to the side. and i cant pull the esc lead out anymore well just don't hit your drone on the battery lead when you crash i guess ill fiddle around a bit might be able to get it a bit safer I don't see the problem, as long as the wires cannot move into the path of the propellers crash directly onto it and there's nothing to save it from pulling hard on the pads of either. you can brace the esc one with a zip tie I guess I wonder if the XT60 lead should be re-routed out the side of the frame instead of out the back probably a better idea. and also if you crash on it now some weird bending is going to happen. it'd probably just unplug but you would've still hit directly onto the batteries xt60 where it's soldered"
Is it fine to bend antennas 90° like that?,"no that probably damaged it. might be done for who knows, probably not yet What does this red dot mean on my vifly whoopstar 3"
whats the cheapest parts list that will be enjoyable on this frame? https://rotorriot.com/collections/bubito-collection/products/rotor-riot-bubito-35mm-frame,It means its actively working
"Ahh thats good, do you possibly know how i can drain a battery? I accidentally charged one to 4v","If you plug the battery into the charger and set the charger to storage mode, it will automatically charge or discharge a battery to get to storage voltage I have a problem with my blitz M10 GPS which got pre installed onto my nazgul XL5 ECO and for some reason it takes like over 1 minute to turn on as in like I plug the battery in and the GPS light turn green however in betaflight the GPS icon doesnt light up until like a minute later.. And its supposed to take 1s or 26s from cold start nope, it happens outside and indoors.. Like when I am outside the satellite number doesnt appear until over a minute after I plugged in the battery.. When I would expect it to appear imideatly or within 26 seconds"
How long does it take things to get for things to go off back-order for getfpv?,"However long it takes for them to get things in stock. And since FL is about to get smacked with a Cat 5 hurricane, I imagine they will be preoccupied.. So right under the VTX antenna, not ideal. i mean it was put there by iflight That doesn't mean it's ideal for GPS performance, that just means it's convenient to manufacture."
Why does the GPS icon not light up in betaflight and it takes like a minute for the satellite number to appear in the OSD?. after plugging in the battery,"The GPS needs to acquire lock on a few satellites first. GPS antennas are incredibly sensitive to interference. Try unplugging your VTX, see if that speeds up acquisition when you say lock do you mean fully locked to a satellite. because even when I unplug the battery and plug it straight back in it takes another minute to start. I though that it would like save the satellite data and reconnect quickly In order to get lock, the GPS antenna needs to be getting good reception from *at least* 4 satellites, if not more. It *can* save the data, but if you are not getting a lot more than that, it doesn't matter I end up getting like 21 satellites after a minute or two"
"And if you power cycle the GPS at *that* point, does it still take a minute to get lock again?","Then you have some interference that needs to be identified. Or you have a defective GPS receiver, but the former is more likely So this doesn't mean the GPS is broken, here's a vid of what I mean when I say the icon doesn't light up until after a minute or longer. I've never seen the GPS icon not light up straight away before with my other drone so this just confused me."
why does this feel overpriced as _? https://rotorriot.com/products/bubito_diy_build_kit?_pos=1&_sid=f49c580aa&_ss=r,"because it is. and half the money spent on it will go towards giving drone parts to war zones, since it's rotorriot"
also why people prefer betafpv over happymodel?. in the tinywhoop class,are you going to fly it only outside i have a tinywhoop already but i want to get a second one. idk then you need prop guards. 75mm is a good in-between size bubbyfpv didnt need prop guards i mean. don't know who that is but cool. that bubbyfpv doesn't hit into walls or furniture. i guess because happymodel fucked up the 2024 mobula https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/546421137077305398/1241829322692493423
ah okay. also should i get the meteor or the air?. im still not sure which one i prefer. ive heard that the meteor has more power but its way heavier,air. dunno how the meteor could have more power if it has the same kV motors and is heavier the motors are 0802 compared to 0702
"i dont. so if i have a 65mm already i should just buy the air75, right?","The meteor65 (non pro) is a chonky potato, it doesn't actually have much power. You could. Oor, you can go diy"
what about the pro version?. eh idk,"It's just as chonky but has more power, I still wouldn't buy it tho"
do the air75 is better than the meteor75 pro?,"Yeah. The 75 pro is a chonk too, motors are enormous for nothing. They really should have used some 1002 or even just 0802 motors on bi blades"
okay. ty. should i buy tri blades for the air75 or no?,"Nah. Tho you could get yourself a set of hq ultralight 40mmx2. (the new one, the old one isn't particularly great imo). triblades will reduce the responsiveness on 0802, and you won't even gain any significant power because the motors will just be a bit overwhelmed For some reason when I try to flash my blitz F435 flight controller with betalight it says ""No response from bootloader, Programming: FAILED"" I have tried a lot of things to fix it but none of the applications I have tried can find the device in bootloader mode. what shows up in device manager Nothing unless I turn on show hidden devices and that STMicroelectronics virtual COM port is there even if the flight controller isn't plugged in. under ""other devices"""
you have a lot of stuff plugged in lol. does the cable work for just connecting other than flashing?,yeah I can connect to betaflight and configure it probably drivers then
how do I update them?,you can use the impulserc tool. <https://impulserc.blob.core.windows.net/utilities/ImpulseRC_Driver_Fixer.exe>. or you can go through STM's site and find the DFU drivers. oh wait. it's not STM is it. well try the driver fixer It is STM. i already tried both of them but they still cant find the flight controller in DFU. I tried them again anyway just now but its still the same it's not stm. you have an artery atf chip. <https://www.arterychip.com/file/download/1760> i don't know if that's the correct file
do you have a win 64 version?,"it's not. it's this one. <https://www.arterychip.com/file/download/1764> then the ""Artery_DFU_DriverInstall"" is all you need"
How should i set up the arm channel. Should i dod it up to the yellow line. So only 2000?,"your ARM channel is set up a bit wrong, but not enough to matter I think..."
Does it just not work at all or is there more to it?,show the left side too. with the radio turned on Thx it actually worked Aux 11&12 seem to be glitching It keeps saying low rx signal
"well, how much glitching?. AUX11 and 12 show the signal strength (the old way)","if they're moving around a little, that's normal It keeps loosing telemetry. Yea that's so odd. on the radio, open ExpressLRS menu. and send pics of the very top and very bottom of it On betaflight it says disable  the hardware adc filter. And mine is on global. Ill just rurn it off need to see the bottom too. *also ow my neck* Mybad my phone sucks:face_with_tears_of_joy: on the drone, send this in CLI:  get expresslrs. and post the result. Hm. Mild confusion. y this no worky It only works with 2 of my 4 batterys"
wait wait wait wait wait. the batteries affect it?,Yes. Sometimes it arms. Sometimes not https://tenor.com/view/huh-cat-huh-m4rtin-huh-huh-meme-what-cat-gif-13719248636774070662 When it doesnt arm it just says failsafe which. which drone is this
"iirc. SPI ELRS. in Configuration tab, what PID Loop rate is selected? @milo",Yeah okay I thiink I just ran out of brain cells for this. I'll have to invite you over to here https://discord.gg/expresslrs There's some other big brain ppl in there
"But before i go try asking them, what does rf signal low mean?. Thats what my radio keeps saying",that just means that it thinks that the drone is losing signal Hm. Maybe the elrs antenna needs tightening
honestly ELRS should work at a short distance even without an antenna >.>. I'm wondering if there is some LBT issue. Would you consider flashing the radio's ELRS module to ISM firmware instead of LBT?,"Is that what is causing failsafe idk. I just wanna make sure that it's not some bug in LBT (EU firmware). because those have happened before This Eu firmware is so bad considering it is manditory LBT is just a stupid regulation that put no thought into something like RC links, and it is a nightmare to implement as it sounds like As for the radio, you'd just go through the standard ELRS flashing process (ExpressLRS Configurator)  as for the drone, you'd send this in CLI:   > set expresslrs_domain=ISM2400 > save. the number of people who actually use it is kind of a running joke in the ELRS community. ""and for our 12 LBT users, we fixed some bugs"" Yea… My dad is kind of scared of getting the equipment confiscated. If i was in charge of the pc i would’ve definitely chosen the better stuff"
are you from germany or some similarly over the top regulated country?,"I'm from Czechia and unless you're blasting 1000mW right next to an airport, nobody gives a flying f* don't think anyone in the UK cares. got plenty FM pirates to catch anyway, they definitely won't care for testing. and yeah you're a drop in the ocean anyway :face_with_tears_of_joy:. rogue 50W wifi transmitters are much more annoying (they screw with weather radars). and I'm not interested in the transmit power. I'm interested in getting rid of LBT (which is a big part of the regulation, but if you're not blasting at 1000mW, noone will know)"
I will sneakily get that firmware onto my boxer someday. Could Lbt be the reason for the failsafe then?,"there have been bugs in it that have caused odd behaviour before. also you can flash ELRS over wifi yes. https://expresslrs.github.io/web-flasher/ you can use this to assemble a firmware file for wifi flashing. and then put the ELRS module into wifi mode. connect to the wifi with your phone (turn off mobile data :winking_face: ). and flash it. Guide is here, as always:  https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/rm-internal/"
Wait but will this reset my bindings?,"just this time, ""via WiFi"", ""Manual upload via AP"", and you'll be using the web flasher instead of the PC configurator. if you enter the same binding phrase, no but you will have to flash or reconfigure receivers as well. with the whoop it's dead simple. two commands in CLI. with standalone receivers, it's the same wifi flashing process (you just pick the correct target for the receiver and put the receiver in wifi mode) Ahh okay, ill keep this in mind thanks If you want to keep LBT, like the other 13 people that bother using it, jump into ELRS server and ask around for help. idk what's wrong with your drone. ran out of ideas for now unfortunately Ill go ask my dad n see what he thinks. He doesnt believe Not quite. Not using lbt why. like what's the point of not believing. test it he's the radio police This is only for the purposes of diagnostics if needs be. Beliefs are useless in the face of having the ability to test something. LBT was broken not that long ago. and with how few people use it, it's possible that it broke again To be fair the pc is a pain in the ass to boot up who cares. use the phone Ima try this wifi thing"
anyone have any idea what’s going on? charges normally for the first like 10 seconds before slowing down like this  didn’t happen when i charged them last night  all dji batteries and a dji charger  (ignore me playing war thunder),"How do I connect these Dark magic and a sacred ritual called plugging the connector into the socket my meteor65s vtx seems to be heating up really fast and really bad since i converted it to openprop are you. y'know. air cooling it 3d printed frames, my favorite haha. at least its not melting Analog nano vtxs just run hot, but it's not an issue while flying well im getting bad vtx signal on my goggles. its really shit"
"Can we have a dvr, also, what goggles are you using ?","1. whats dvr 2. betaFPV VR03. sorry, noob here A dvr is a recording of the video feed, which is kind of essential for diagnosing vtx issues, cause most of the time it's just people that try to fly with 20 trees a house and a panda between them and the quad and not understanding why they don't have much range anymore okay. imma record smth And we need a dvr of your actually flying and having the issue, not very useful orherwise hmm went surprisingly well but its flickering the whole time. it used to be way better before the conversion. That's just analog breakup. It's normal"
"k, so before the goggles couldnt even find the right band. is that just regular overheated vtx?. thanks for the help and ur time also","That's just the ev800d being the ev800d, it's better to manually select the band and channel, you can set it easily in betaflight, then set it in the goggles and forget about it. I would recommend you use r8 for indoors since it goes above wifi frequencies You can just leave it on r8 alright. asking for my 5 inch There isn't really any significant difference between the different bands Vtxs do output more generally on lower frequencies, but it's not really that significant on most vtx so don't worry about it. So just choose either r8 or r1 and forget about it and band-wise. i am on fatshark rn R8 is *raceband* 8. Band is raceband i meant one of the five, sorry Anyone know why the internal storage of my walksnail VTX  wouldn't show up on my computer and phone Connected everything with no luck, tried powering on and off multiple times ok raceband 1 it is cuz my friend uses 8 You could use raceband7, it's still fairly far from wifi and raceband is designed so none of the channels bleed on each other. It's very dumb btw that the others do overlap a little if you have wifi 6e. you can give up wow thanks!. in oscar liang we trust Solution : only use ethernet. Cables are the future"
I wanna build a 3d printed fpv plane for summer so which stl should i use? And will it be easy to fly or should i practice a bit with a simulator if theres one? (I only flew a dji mavic 2 pro last 2 years ago lol),"you're going to need a good transmitter. please do not end up buying anything other than expresslrs. radiomaster/jumper. you'll have to pick what kind of plane, and you probably want to talk in #wings Oh sorry bout that and thanks. Now lets hope i remember this in 9 months later even after having it on my notes :loudly_crying_face:"
"hey guys, using the avatar hd walksnail vtx and the goggles x. is there anyway to include audio in records using the goggles?","you'd have to buy a microphone and mount it on the drone. none of the digital protocols can do audio Or just get a hd camera that has a mic. Better footage and noise Yea I want to find a good audio recorder, don't want to carry a whole extra camera same here. how do those action cameras get such ""nice"" audio with all the wind I wish they had a mic though, I miss hearing the props in my ear"
Who said i needed it on a drone?,I need help my radio dont wanna corectly calibrate on uncrashed i try a lot of time besides the extra weight on the drone I feel like having a extra camera like a gopro is better. you can use it on other things than just the drone and it offers better quality then DVR or onboard recording
just keeping it by you to record audio?,Airplane with a pan tilt mount for the Walksnail Moonlight
Good day all! I apologize if this is a stupid question.  I have some 6S batteries with a single dead cell.  The charger and battery testers show the batteries as 5S now.  Would it be safe to charge and use them without physically removing the dead cell? Thanks for any feedback.,"You need to completely disconnect and bypass or remove the dead cell. If you leave it electrically connected, the chances of it lighting itself on fire when you try to charge it with the rest of the battery go up *dramatically*"
y? is it cuz of the weight,"because of everything Thank you for the response. I will definitely remove the cell.  Thanks again best tinywhoop aio currently, light frame. all that would u pick it or the 75mm 75mm because i want to option for it to fly outside better. 65mm if i suddenly cared about racing or very very tiny furniture spaces"
i already have a mob 8 so prolly only using for indoors. speaking of the mobula 8 why does it have such weak motors compared to other whoops?,"it's good to have a backup for when it breaks tru tru. though i’d probably learn to fix them i have no clue to be honest it just seems like an insanely silly drone i was so confused when i saw a 65mm had double its power and i thought it was powerful motor size also matters mmh ic. still doesn’t make sense to me though is hard to explain for me mob8 runs on 2S batteries, most smaller whoops on 1S rpm is motor kv * voltage, so it ends up being roughly the same speed for both ah i didn’t know that. thanks"
its doing that out of box??,what target did you flash it with I haven't flashed it yet yea. no. it was working before you sure youre connected to it and not in the virtual mode on accident i resoldered the motor wires cuz they were not proper now it not working yeah try reflashing it. make a backup tho
"when I connect a battery to my drone and turn on the goggles (im usuing the googles x), I can see the current battery voltage on the goggle's screen. However, after using the battery for a bit and it drops to, lets say, 4.0V, when I replace it with a fully charged one, the goggles still show the voltage of the previous battery as if its still connected to the drone. Does anyone know what I can do to fix this?. and It doesnt matter when I disconnect the battery and replace it, whether the voltage is at 4.1V, 3.9V, 3.5V, etc. when I switch to a fully charged battery, the screen on my goggles still shows the voltage from the previous battery, and it treats the new battery as if it’s the old one. This means the voltage reading starts from the point where I disconnected the old battery. For example, if I unplug the previous battery at 3.7V and connect a new one, the screen still shows 3.7V, as if I just unplugged and plugged in the same battery",you are supposed to bend it
"Good afternoon everyone, I joined discord, I would like to start this adventure but I need to know what would be my first drone to buy? I didn't want to spend a lot of money right now, which one do you think I should buy? Thank you very much for the help.",im talking about the betaflight one. this one yeah but it got those bend marks on top. its bent where it shouldnt be
Are you wanting to fly FPV or do you just want a camera drone to cruise around and take decent pictures?,"It's fine, you can't really remove them anymore anyway"
"Does that element ever update for the new battery, even if you go fly?","yes after i connect and disconnect both of the batteries(the googles and the drone) until it works Why don't you try just plugging in the new battery on the quad, and arming it. See if that triggers the OSD to update Though, weirdly, I would think that when you plug in the new battery, you would see the Betaflight logo show up as it boots"
"Start here: https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639. My understanding is that Betaflight erases and redraws the entire OSD on Walksnail, so it's incredibly strange that only one element is stuck. When that happens, are you able to toggle the flight mode switch and see it change?",Everything is working fine besides the battery voltage. I will record it today and ill tag you here
which grips should i get for my radio?. theres so many of them,"just a shipping question, i live on small island, that doesnt really have access to lipo batteries in house, if i where to buy batteries from lets say getfpv as an example(i dont know if they do ship batteries) do those batteries then come by boat, or do they just not send them internationally at all"
"2.5"" 6s build using 1404 2900kv motors.  Will rubycon capacitor 35v 270 microph be alright?","So I bought the dji mini 4k, though I can't download the app since it's made for ""an older version of android"" (I got the samsung S23 You can bypass that. Should be a option to install anyway @DædalusFPV look. (Its the same battery)"
Good question. Should i choose the first one?. Ch1?,"getfpv doesnt ship batteries to non mainland US iirc. if you order them from the manufacturer directly they might. just itll take a while since they gotta go by ship most likely hmm okay, i tried cnhl, they dont ship here either, ill look around Pick whatever one. Honestly that might be your issue, I'm not sure the public channel would fully function as expected :persevering_face:. Still… youre running a hV. whats your max cell voltage set to under battery & power in betaflight Oh yea I forgot about that :p. im like 120% certain thats the problem 4.3+V per cell would for sure throw off the stock setting. @GaLfield_33 MrSlowFood saving the day change the max cell voltage in the battery and power tab to like 4.4v Oh greate.

Hi! I have got a DJI Mini 2 SE and i want an upgrade. What drone should i get to get the best resolution for filming ? (price range 0-1000eur). Sorry for my bad english,"Waffles is a very oblivious American and it's funny xD. I meaaaaan, the further away you go from Czechia, the fewer of them you see :angry_face:. Idk what you mean but it sounds like an insult there used to be infinite skodas in the netherlands. wonder what happened people in wealthier countries upgraded. and the cars got shipped off to less wealthy countriies (incl back to Czechia lmao) they were around in germany a lot longer The eachine wizzard one. Nah im jk you almost got a warning for that one I`m looking for a camera drone my sis still drives a 1st gen octavia and she's been considering restoring it Unfortunately the chassis is getting a bit soft now :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: *Well, to be fair, she used it to flip a land/range rover*. *and the octavia only incurred minor damage from that incident* loll. surely there's footage of that she clipped the trailer that a rover was towing while trying to overtake it. and the whole thing ended up with a rover on its side xD. Horrifying and impressive at the same time the front right fender, front right light assembly and a bit of the body underneath was mangled on the octavia, but otherwise it was fine. ish. it may have tweaked the chassis just enough to start cracking windshields that sounds like barely anything yeah like for the amount of mayhem that happened, it's minor Powering on an ESC without a flight controller connected is safe right. I don't see why it wouldn't be but I just want to make sure generally yeah, as long as you don't have props on the motors on it My trottle can only go down to -99.6    I tried calibrating but no result -> Tx12  any suggestions. i'm worried I cannot arm soon calibrate again and this time DON'T press hard against the edges. also check if your trims are centered. anyway, it doesn't really matter that much. as you can set up the min/max in BF -99.6 should be plenty low enough anyway, that should be throttle 0.2%, or 1002uS Thanks, I already did this :slightly_smiling_face:   I will check out the trims tho:thumbs_up:. had no idea out my head what the minimum arm value is, but I noticed last session it didn't arm unless I messed with it. thx Does it matter if the solders for motors touch each other unless each one is like positive and negative and ground"

"alright, what;s better about it? ang range?. oh nice",depends on if you pick wifi or bluetooth
Im guessing bluetooh is like 40meters?,"yeah pretty much. maybe a bit more I have a bluetooth module but i wanna use wifi for longer range. like around 200 meter, longer the better you can use wifi then. they can make or connect to other hotspots what's the rating on that thing. how does that work, just a simple thing. yo those are like 3x the price of the other chips... imagine it like an arduino except it has a bunch of other fancy stuff built in. the same way you can buy different models of arduinos, theres different models of these two. some of them have stuff like 2 usb ports. and they do 10x the amount of stuff"

"ima get these, two of them and its perfect. are the mini and worse in range?. huh they're costlier","they have external antennas so I don't think so, but youll have to do a bit of research. im not really sure ima just use these. thanks though thats a good idea. no problem. the 32 wroom boards are probably the easiest to use too. and you can use the same arduino IDE program for them. just add the libraries"

did you do the calculations for how many gears youll need?. ah ok. hmm,"not rly, but i saw a few vids and they did like 2:1 on similar motors so ig ill do same the motor youre using may spin WAY to fast. ok fair enough yeah thats why im gearing it down"
are you 3d printing gears?,"yeah i will do it for the bigger ones, but i was thinking if i did it for the small one which attaches to hte motor it would break or not screw on well im not sure where you would buy a gear like that at but whatever it is, i think its just gonna have to slide on and then use a nut, or use a setscrew alright, ill prolly do that, but if i use a 3d printed gear, wont the *screw lines* on the motor rip through the PLA(3d printed part material) cause it isnt rly strong. and its going to be rly high speeds if you put a nut on the motor like youre supposed to, it will be friction between the motor bell and the nut that holds the gear on. i would be much more worried about the gear teeth breaking I was thiking something like this. and then 3d print larger gears keep in mind, high speed and high torque are different youll have a hard time 3d printing gears with teeth small enough to work with those gears exactly what i was thinking. I cant find a big gear with small hole diameter thats because the root problem here is that youre trying to adapt hardware for something it was never intended for. which i understand, and I like doing that too, but it's just never going to work as well as something purpose built"

Because you've crashed it and broke it?,Anyone know why it's not turning on the battery is connecting. Avata i didnt crash it and even if one of the motors isnt spinning shouldnt it atleast turn on. the only think that broke was the motor

will it stop the automatic recording on my vtx too?,yes. feels like it just lost power randomly and started up again
They are two separate entities? Huh….. Why solder JSTs to the board? Why not just solder wires down?,Hmm interesting ty. I'll see what happens when I plug it in to bf or esc config.. No issues with continuity test
So it is better to solder the motors directly to the board ?,"JST connectors for motors will be a *serious* bottleneck, and could very well melt themselves in flight. In fact I would think they absolutely would. Unless you're building like a 2"" or sub 2"" whoop I do build 2'' but the connectors are nod soldered on the board. But they has so small pin holes and I am not sure if I can solder them by myself It doesn't matter where they are. JST connectors are simply not rated for the amount of current most quads will push through the motors"
ugh ... but if I need to change the motors ?,"De-soldering and re-soldering a motor is a 2 minute job. Besides, if you're crashing hard enough to need to change a motor, the motor itself is very likely not the only thing you'll need to replace well, I have no experience with soldering.... I prepeared some old board from old devices for traning xD It is not difficult and it is an absolutely necessary skill. Soldering motor wires is a lot easier than soldering JST connector pins I can tell you that. Okay thanks, the board should be delivered next week, I haven't ordered anything else. I kinda risk on good deal board you can get some practice boards It just adds more that can fail…. That will fail"
am i correct on this one aymeric?,"does it matter if a vtx moves a little in myfpv drone i think ya. because it will mass up the gyro on the fc You are supposed to have it mounted, not dangling inside the frame Depends on the vtx, but if he is a running a somewhat chonky one it might, if it can bump into the fc it will, if he runs a nano vtx then it probably won't I'm more worried he just didn't mount the vtx with anything and it will eject out after a sharp yaw and end up in the props"
"""3.6"" seriously? lol lets just move back to mm again","I think you might be the only person who wants to change over to mm for props, inches work just fine. And it's easier to remember 5"" than 125mm. And you can make fun of inches more easily than mm. It's about the performance/use case. It's a heavy boy 100g with tpu, compared to a 65g grinderino that will be just as durable. (And if you live in the eu, I would recommend you also take a look at the squirrel35 from rubberquads)"
Receiver: PNP / Frsky R-XSR / TBS NanoRX / ELRS 915MHz / ELRS 2.4G What should i pick in elrs config?  GEPRC Nano 2.4GHz PA100 RX GEPRC Nano(SE) 2.4GHz RX GEPRC True Diversity 2.4GHz RX,"Well, if we don't know the quad we can't help you, all we know is that it's a GEPRC elrs2.4 receiver that you have with no clues as to what the specific model might be Geprc smart 16. I just bought a new radio, so but i forgot the steps i need to make haha"
"Been flying the Smart 16 with a old TX with external elrs module. Do i need to change anything in the drone to get it into the new radio?. Go with elrs config, device geprc 2.4ghz -> device GEPRC Nano(SE) 2.4GHz RX i think, then build and connect new TX to wifi and load file there right?","I only talk in mm until 45mm, I still say 2"" and 2.5"", and afaik most people do too, and I much prefer using inches now that I'm used to it And using inches eliminate the confusion of 2.5"" and 65mm (the frame size) which can also sometimes happen for bigger quads when you have beginners that pass by and say they have a Xmm quad and that it falls perfectly with like a 7"" or whatnot and they actually had a 5"" all along. And saying ""a 5"" quad"" sounds less dumb than saying ""a 250mm quad"", especially now that everyone uses inches for prop size. Also it would make props akward, cause now it would be like a 125x107.5x3v2s instead of a 5x4.7x3v2s"
as opposed to 5.1x4.7x3?,"And if we all shifted to using mm again we would tell someone to get a say 5x whatever for their 250mm quad but they can't say it's a 5"" prop but it's called a 5x something. Well actually we are both wrong it's 5x4.3x3v2s. But my point still stands so does mine, it would be called a 13x11x3 prop I still prefer inches, especially now that everyone talks about props in inches. I don't really see us going back you're entitled to your opinion. now enjoy those 3.6"" frames :grinning_squinting_face: I like how 3.5"" sounds (also 3.6"" is a blasphemy, every 3.5"" frame can fit 3.6"" props, it's just GEPRC and axis flying being annoying) Well it sounds to me that they are telling the truth and not falsely advertising"
"Do we call our 5"" frames 5.2"" frames ? No, because that's stupid, they can fit 5.2"" but you won't call them a 5.2"" frame",Hmmm ok. I see both sides. I wonder if my 65mm drone can fit 65mm props
could u figure out or tell me how to do it? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:,Step one: write the name of your quad in discord Step two: click send Geprc smart 16. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Did you already configure it before ?,"Yes, ive been flying the drone with diffrent TX before"
btw it´s Enable wifi and not RX wifi?. on the radio,"How come when i only added bindingphrase and tried to save :p The only reason im considering it is bcs it doesnt have props in view why are people so annoyed with props in view. vx3.5 doesn't have props in view (well, it does on some cameras but very minimally), also way lighter Bcs, id use it for some cinematic stuff. With the walksnail moonlight cam I mean, maybe, but we aren't doing feature films All videos i've seen it has the props in view. True but id just realy prefer it well, the prop to image ratio doesn't seem too bad to me"
What cam is that?. O3?,"walksnail nano v3, same fov as the moonlight Oh alr. Yeah, well idk. I gues i could always use my thumb pro if i dont want props in view and you will get better quality video. and it will let you use the normal vtx and save like 10g. only upsides"
"If something supports 6s voltage, does that mean it supports 6s HV as well? This FC has an upper voltage limit of neatly 6s HV. I won't burn it? When I power it, the voltage should sag, right?","That depends on the actual specs of the regulator that handles that higher voltage. https://tenor.com/view/sometimes-maybe-good-maybe-shit-gif-15610659 You don't need me to tell you, just go watch footage from both I value your opinion, thats why i asked you."
Big metal objects are bad for signal yes. But elrs should be able to handle it for a bit though.. What output power are you using on your radio?,"100mw. It doesn’t want to go higher Then it might be in ce mode the receiver will likely be the limiting factor, most don't have PA/LNA I gues vitroid has to educate us once again Power Amplifier and Low Noise Amplifier.  An LNA can amplify the incoming signal from the antenna to the RF chip, and a PA can amplify the outgoing signal from the RF chip to the antenna. > A Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) directly adds to your incoming RSSI. Typical gains are in the ballpark of +12dBm which will be observed in the RSSI as being 12dBm higher than it would have been without the LNA. This is because the LNA amplifies the incoming signal coming from the antenna before going to the RF chip, which increases the sensitivity of the receiver by boosting the incoming signal. An LNA also boosts the noise by the same amount so the sensitivity limit will likely be lower than the value quoted by the Lua. >  > A Power Amplifier (PA) boosts the outgoing signal strength and extends the telemetry range back to the TX. Without a PA, the power output is limited by the RF chip's max power output itself (around +13dBm 20mW). It works the same way as turning up the power output on the transmitter module, however it is not adjustable. The receiver's output can be ran at adjustable power levels given range needs. Most PAs are 20dBm/100mW, meaning the telemetry transmit power can be adjusted to 10, 25, 50 or 100mW. >  > Receivers with a PA/LNA will have a listed telemetry output power in dBm or mW Except that camera quality is somewhat subjective, just go look at footage of both"
how much kv do y’all perfer on a 65mm?,"Ok but like, the *actual* spec of the chip that's on the board, which you have no way of knowing just from this list. So again. It depends. You have no way of knowing exactly where the limit is until you look up the actual part number of the component. 32000Kv I'd better ask the manufacturer this is such a hard decision :loudly_crying_face: really any that say they can do either 1080 or 720p at whatever size you see fit its mounted but moves up and down a little bit, like with the movements it might move but not touch anything.. just wondering if that would affect the video quality at all"
"Why ?. Just pick one. It shouldn't move tho, use shorter screws or double sided vhb tape, you want it secured down not flopping",its going to move its the TBS Unify pro32 nano Just use double sided vhb tape
"Whats making this? When i flip down, and nothing when i flip up as i want the arm to be ?","I want arm to be up and it aint reacting then arm is disabled because it's plugged in, it's just written down stupidly Ehrrm ok. So down is arm. But disabled when plugged in :grinning_face_with_sweat: with ELRS, ARM needs to be on AUX 1 on the high value. ie around 2000"
So basicly i cant have that stick then?. Or i can but just down and not up then i assume?,"you can map that switch to AUX 1, and you can make it so that the position you want it to be in when armed is down. just takes a bit of setup Would u, or just change pos / switch. Iam rookie i assume u want it there on the t15 it can be any switch you want in any position you want"
I change that pos in the tx then in inputs?,"you can mix the switch onto an AUX channel in the mixer tab. mixes. there you can also set the weight from 100 to -100 to invert its value. ow my neck sry. there u go my man yeah that's already set correctly, you might want to invert it depending on how you want to use it"
beeper ofc forgot that. prearm?. never used it. hmm in what way u use that?. double safety?,yes. honestly quite important
"really?. Is it ""just"" for double saftey. just incase u hit that arm switch?",yup. there's a lot of accidenta
Maybe i shouldnt have that right by arm?. in same direction. Red up = Arm. Black up = Pre arm. or is it fine u think?,it's personal preference where you have it. I have it on the momentary switch on the other side of the radio basically what that switch is for lol
"u having beeper on what u call it press and release?. is that momentary?. or ""spring"" loaded. haha. Any need for Launch control?. Arm Angle->Horizon Beeper Flip after crash Prearm",beeper is push toggle. prearm is push momentary. I think I will set up launch control for racing
"Wouldnt be that bad to have beeper on momentary?. then u dont have to hold tx while ""searching"". for that lost drone in the grass",it's toggle. you push it in and it stays. you push it in again and it comes out
iam mixing the fk out of it. haha. Is this normal??. and second question why aint it arming? haha,"my question is why do you have props on and are trying to arm a drone on your desk with batteries holding it down. youre asking for it to fly into something (like your fingers) i know what it´s doing when arming. nothing, but generally a bad idea i know"
?. yeah but what if it does do something,then i learn the hard way anyways connect it to betaflight and send a screenshot of the overview tab Thanks for advice .D. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: the tab. called overview
yes. is your prearm set up correctly?. like the mode,"i guess. ill grab a quick video sec alright. or take your props off, try to arm while in betaflight and send a picture of the setup tab again"
Best antenna combo for the goggles x?,.. no. you cant arm while connected to betaflight. you need to disconnect your usb. then unplug the battery and plug it back in. so the fc restarts. then you can try. with your props off. or outside
"Slowfood. Still nothing. usb disc, batterys out and in then tried. no arm reactiong. ?",Thats the happymodel mobula 8 try to arm while in betaflight and send a picture of the setup tab again
What should change? In the tab?. But yea otherwise 1 sec. Arming display flags?. Does that say what the prob is?,two truerc x2-air mk2. or any other similar antenna Iam here to learn so explain if you want to :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: yep. it tells you the reason its not arming. MSP means its connected to betaflight so thatll always be there. noprearm means no prearm. throttle means your throttle is not down
Why the x2 and not the x for example?,the goggles x do not have tx diversity. so you want an antenna with a very wide beamwidth. to make up for that Thanks! Ill check what error in a sec. Btw wouldnt see much outside :grinning_squinting_face: Ohh. Got it. Thanks emilia @Mr.SlowFood. seems like i got little bit of throttle but it´s all the way down send a picture of the reciever tab. with the throttle all the way down. entire tab
throttle is at pitch. wrong channel map?. Tx is aetr?,change channel map to aetr. yeah. aetr1234 now only msp. should i trim tx yep so youre all good to go then
or adjust deadcenter?. 989?,why. your main channels are all dead center @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) exactly what i was looking for
so that it´s 989 aint anything to worry bout?. it shouldnt be 1000?. or,meh not that big of a deal
Should i go for lhcp or rchp?. *rhcp,otherwise joshua bardwell has a video on channel endpoints im rpetty sure. flyign analog or digital
Could i trim the throttle switch on radio to 1000?,not hdzero i assume right. dont do that
it messes up centering?,it messes up your entire throttle range
"oke!. is the ""arm"" switch there cuz of saftey in BF?",it makes literally no difference if you set them or not. it doesnt arm when connected to betaflight
yea so that´s why. it´s a flag?,Yep. Flying with walksnail lhcp then. it tells you that the arm switch is in the arm position Then i actually learned something about the Arming disable flags. Thanks!. And double check channel mapping
What is the difference?,one coems with omnis and one doesnt
So the first options?,idk what omnis it comes wtih. and i dont know what omnis you would use for walksnail cause theyre kinda weird iirc
Are you sure its not like a deal or something?. Like two antennas or something like that,its a combo... with a stubby
Maybe emilia can help me with this one. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) which one should I go for?,well since. one tx. you don't need the stubbies Now that why it cost more…. My dumb ass thought  it was a deal or something. Alr. Thank you guys. But now im asking why it cost double the regular x2 air
oh im getting two? I thought it was only one patch with two x air,the combo. combines. it gives you the x2 air and a omnidirectional one Oh no im talking about the regular one. Its cost 101$ Instead of like 6”. 0
Alr now i understand. So im getting two patches right?,Alr thanks bro. Sorry for pestering you
Btw to connect them i just need to take out the top antennas and screw the new ones? Do I need to config something?,sometimes my video feed just completely cuts out randomly and i think it has something to do with my antenna on my whoop. but nothing appears to be out of the ordinary
Do any 18650 battery’s work in the radio master pocket?,"They need to be flat top but besides that there shouldn't be issues. Check if RadioMaster has dimensions listed on their site of the batteries they sell Silver wire is the better conductor, but much more expensive Its just for my ELRS receiver so I think I should be good unless it's gonna effect range Soldering your ELRS receiver with silver wire will not improve your range. It would, however, be boujee as fuck Idk what they use in regular wires. But the ones my reciever came with got ruined. So I just stripped down an ethernet cable. Found out it's copper Just copper, mostly. Cheap shit is aluminum"
"?. for that battery you do 1.2 amp-hours times 1C = 1.2 amps. or if you wan tto do 2c, 2.4 amps","if i have a drone with a dji 03 air unit and a elrs module can i use the dji fpv controller 2 and the goggles v2 with it still if im correct that should work but you wont need the elrs module since the dji fpv controller would work directly with the air unit ok because im looking at this used drone its a geprc cinelog 20 with 03 airunit and the guy specced it out with elrs he prob wasnt using the dji remote. since it's kinda bad is there a good elrs controller thats not to expensive. cause i have an avata. thats why i have the dji one If you only own the avata, then getting an elrs radio will be the same thing as getting a fancy paper weight ok so no elrs radio. is there a good dji o3 unit build for around 350 radiomaster pocket. or boxer, depending on your definition of expensive i dont think ill need one. aymeric said itll be like a fancy paperwight since i already have the dji one only for full dji quads. for self-built quads it's better is this goodRadioMaster Zorro ill get this for christmas make sure to get the elrs one and get the drone for my birthday in 2 weeks and 2 18350 batteries ok. how long does a 660mah battery last on a drone. this is the battery they reccomend for the cinelog 20 it says 4to6 min is that a lot. or average seems about average. for a cinewhoop how much does a normal fpv drone last. the ones that look like an X"
Flight time or durability?,"5 to 7 if you're cruising 4-6mins seems reasonable id be hard pressed to get more than 4.5-5 out of my 5"" but LR builds can go for 10-15, just depends how you build em how much does one like that cost with a 03 air unit. the ones with 10-15 min https://rotorbuilds.com/build/23921 https://rotorbuilds.com/build/26959 take a look at these and check the prices on parts. I don't know much about the digital systems so i cant help you with that. these can fly upwards of 20 with liion cells, but they won't have nearly as much power as my 5"" with 4 minutes of flight time lol. parts lists and prices are at the bottom of the guide. they may be slightly out of date but should still be relevant i cant solder for shit especialy small soldering. ill prob just get the cinelog. this looks ocmplex af You can easily get like 30-45min on a decent lr build i am guessing you have bad soldering gear. and are now claiming you are bad at something you haven't practiced and have only had trash for no my friend has insane soldering gear. my hands r shakey idk but he owns a company"
https://youtu.be/GoPT69y98pY?feature=shared&t=1625,"""owns a company"" does not equate to having good gear. watch how easy it is lol. if you have the right gear and set the right temps its a robotics one could prob have him do it for me its ALL about setup. many robotics are plug n play lol. but sure, may as well for the pink drone can i use the 03 air unit instead of the vista thingy. when i click on a prts link its taking me to this just google the part name. or find one of similar size/rating ok. can i use the 03 unit instead of the vista i dont know anything about digital"
real quick question! regarding start up power maximum and minimum on bluejay. What do you lot use? never really thought about it and left it at default value.... Ive bumped it up a little bit to this,"probably. what drone is it. ah i see. the camera is a little wider than your regular cameras and it has weird mounting. you can most likely make it work but itll take some jank Depends on the power/mass ratio of the motors as to what are appropriate values here. There's no hard and fast rule really. fair enough. Ill just leave it as is then. You tend to need to jack it up high for tiny whoop motors, to get them spinning as they don't have the torque of beefier motors. They are 1404 motors 2900kv on a 2.5"" cinewhoop frame. ive cranked them up like 20% like the slider was way way way to the left. yes 6s :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Noice. They shouldn't need too much help to get spinning to be fair. ye fair enough! ill give it a shot. I got the same build in 4s but its just not cutting it. Plus from the discussions ive had from people who are in the profession of commercial / real estate. They somehow all have the same builds 2.5"" running 6s and using 1100 mah lihv lipos. I have 1404 4600kV on mine, but it's more designed as a backyard ripper than a cine drone.. And rip it does. :red_heart: I need a small backyard ripper. I got those motors in my basket for future."
"What Packet rate did you choose in the ExpressLRS menu on your radio?. for newbies I recommend 250Hz (aka L250), not D250",ohhhh. ya ya i choose 250
"250Hz, not D250? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:","anyway, doesn't matter for the drone part. for the drone's FC 250 is 250. In that case here you'd pick Tracer/ELRS 250Hz"
"tunnuing. i choose a preset. btw im seeing now that i have vouple of options to choose in the packet rate, which one is better? 50hz 100hz 150hz 250hz 333hz 500hz  d250 d500  f500 f1000",250Hz or 500Hz for most cases. Pick the other ones if you understand what's going on
@GaLfield_33 is this a prebuilt or a new build?,okay. needed to ask if you made a backup of the original settings if it was a prebuilt
i flew it couple of times but now i want to tunn it with the preset. do you know which one i need to choose?,"500Hz sends stick position updates 2x as often as 250Hz, but has less range.. For the vast majority of people, 250Hz is way more than fast enough. ya for me too. um... i need some help with this one"
didn't you already apply that previous preset?. which already asked for the RC tune?,it was 50. i dont know why ya. its was the 50hz preset one
so i dont need the expresslrs preset?. no,somehow i had a 50hz preset already on my drone
how do you know that?,because it has a star on it that's just favourites. unless I'm mistaken
"wait let start from the beginning, do i need an expresserls preset?","If you were dealing with a tune that didn't include an RC preset, then yes. but from what you sent before, it looks like the tune you applied already contains that got it. i think i had the 50hz preset on my drone idk why the star next to a preset is just a ""add to favourites"" button"
so how do i know which presets i have on my drone?,you don't. unless you write it down a preset is just a set of settings that get applied. you can apply presets which overwrite each other's settings ok so thats good. where do i find this btw top right. master multiplier is in PID tuning tab iirc oh ya i see it now. thanks man
Do you have a TPU-capable 3d printer?,How should I secure this antenna Yeah but it isn't set up and I don't got time to print anything if it was. My only ideas are hot glue and zip ties Zip tie it to the frame standoffs. Not the ideal position but better than nothing
"guys if im planning to buy a new antenna for my googles x, and this is the moonlight antenna spec i need to pick a lhcp antenna right?",Yes LHCP is standard for Walksnail
:thumbs_up:. Is it a problem that the antennas are touching each other?,"Just so you know, Flyfish RC has released all of its STL files for its VX5 series on thingyverse. I believe they do have a rear end tpu print for dual antennas. It's not a problem that they touch, but having them in the same orientation like that is pretty pointless This is how they look regularly, and the tpu part is from flyfish, i asked them to add one when i bought the frame This is what I came up with Im trying to find a way to secure them because i had to cut the tpu to fit them because I couldn’t take out the antennas from the vtx Trying to reduce how much it can move so the props don't destroy it (i destroyed one of the vtx screw:loudly_crying_face: )"
Will it hold?. Wait hug. Huh. Do you use Escconfigurator. Bzw will it hold?,Wayyyyyyyyyy too much solder on every joint but the far right
aight. so do you think it'll hold?. or it just :mindblown:,Joints look cold. Redo them. They should be shiny and round this won't hold. what solder and iron do you have. because that isn't flowing at all
wdym. what would happen if i left it like that. would it either just pop off or move so that they bridge?,"oh you risk having wasted all your money. just fix it dude. What tin do you have and what soldering iron do you have aight. as for the iron and solder Solder: Sn100NI+ your solder isn't flowing, it is supposed to flow and cover the pad That isn't for soldering... that's for mechanical welding/soldering... it was marked as electric solder. it has kolophonium or however you call it. i do also have an alternative solder. and its conductive I don't think any of this is going to work which sucks"
what would an optimal setup be?,"proper soldering iron, way more than 15 watts for ESC pads and good heat transfer. best is Pinecil, but Sequre irons are easier to find in Europe and combined with a flat tip like a TS-BC2 i  do have another one and then for solder just get 63/37 no clean solder that is actually branded. Stannol, Kester, MG Chemicals, TBS anything that has the wattage as the main advertising point won't really be Why won't it hold it looks alr Superglue could work. To hold it It looks alr. My solders look like dat on controllers your controller is not comparable to a quadcopter. suggesting those joints are fine is downright dangerous and could cost the dude A LOT of money Then they aren't done right either. That doesn't mean they're done right. I mean if it works it works No.. If it works, but isn't done right, it ~~may~~ **will** separate when exposed to the vibrations of flight. Won't using flux fix that no since it literally isn't solder. lol Oh, the pure tin wire, for brazing metals together. 10 dollars of things that won't ever be useful sadly Tbh im using a $7 iron It has a soldering iron"
"You really are a conman's wet dream, aren't you?",we've seen what you end up with :loudly_crying_face: Not a good thing. Ever. My iron was 6 dollars. :cold_face:
"But Why?! When a Pinecil costs what it does, what in the name of hot rod red flying fucks are people doing buying shitshow irons?","I would rather use the money saved on vbucks. What's that It's a cheap but actually good soldering iron. This one's only 14 dollars https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/ Tape is your best friend With shipping it's almost 40 You can get it cheaper on Amazon but. you really need to learn how important it is to buy quality gear It's 40 on amazon too. I barely solder a cheap soldering iron won't last, it'll always be a pain and it'll make you not like soldering. something like a Pinecil will last a decade and be a joy I'll buy it when I get money. I spent all my money on a ams. And a avata. Oh and vbucks. Lots of vbucks"
Should i convert my mobula 8 to a bassline?. ive heard good things about it. what are the negatives/downsides. and what are the positives,does anyone know what the max supported sd card size is for the jumper t-lite you wont regret it. This has been my only soldering iron since joining the hobby 1.5 years ago. Its a amazing bit of kit. is probably heavier. flies better because no prop guards and might be more durable
How does no prop make it fly better. Also would you recommend it for a newish person?,times I wish I was better at explaining lol. tl;dr they restrict air flow Ah. Oh that makes sense only good if you're flying around people or stuff you don't want to damage. tinywhoops have them so they don't eat your furniture. and also so it bounces off things easier at that scale iirc there was a person named cat(s) that had one @Leah. she's literally flying it right now
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what was the soldering iron that you recommended me yesterday called?,i dunno. the pinecil probably Thats it i think thanks should i convert my mobula 8 to a bassline frame
so even if i put in a 32gb or a 64gb itll still recognize?,"yeah if you format it correctly Imo yes, carbon frames are way more durable and they don't have the extra drag of a whoop frame"
ill do that then. >https://pyrodrone.com/products/happymodel-baseline-fpv-drone-frame-kit< its this one right?,Is this fast enough for the avata
then these are the right props? <https://pyrodrone.com/products/gemfan-hurricane-2023-3-tri-blade-prop-4cw-4ccw>. if you're getting the fly more it comes with one,"ah. yes its fast enough the included one is 190MB/s read. and90MB/s write i paid 450 for the bundle, avata, 2 batteries, v2 goggles, and a fpv dji controller 2"
wtf thats a really good deal?,Im forcing you to learn to fly it in manual since ive seen too many pilots be scared to fly it in manual im scared to fly manual. the drone is coming like 4 days. i have the everything else tho. i just need a good fpv sim i use liftoff. its very floaty though the drones fall faster irl
its good practice though. what do you want to use it for?,"the drone. also get the sim ah. btw get the sim. any sim works, i use liftoff itll save you loads of money ok ill practice until the drone comes then ill start slow with manual"
yeah. find a feild. field?. same difrence,i have a giant soccer feild next to me
you soldered motors to an ESC with solderpaste?,not for soldering like this. today is the day of people using anything but solder to solder
oh wait it's probably plumbing soldering flux isn't it?,assume something like that yeah
Is it to late?. Can IPA solve it?,actually no they advertise it for PCB use. sorry for the confusion lol
How do you mean? Does it gonna destroy my components even with IPA?,"it's fine for PCB soldering use. this does suck though. Not in a damaging way, but it's gonna be harder to use well if the flux isn't no-clean it's probably corrosive so you have to clean it up"
"What about my solder? Labels a bit broken but its tin, lead and copper","> Protection against corrosion: Its unique formula prevents corrosion on non-ferrous metals, ensuring long-lasting protection. Most importantly, it guarantees the reliability of your connections. it's marketing fluff, but yes it should be safe"
"I know this sucks like really, but can it work? It did take me very long time to do","I doubt it'll work for long it might work long enough to test. but yeah I'd re-do it The problem I had is that the cables is flat. So It is hard to do better I think And I can’t just cut the cables, the are to short then you could get racewire Instead of round, I did accidentally did in some how in a way or other make every one flat probably fine. not the best alloy but better than unleaded wat how do you make a wire flat squished the strands flat instead of twisting them tight and then tinning them have that flux on stand-by"
yeahghhh. that aint that good. it'll hold. but wont as long as normal solders. might wanna get rid of some solter and clean it with some isopropyl alc.. did you rip a pad?,"the thing you put the solder and wire on. the brass lookin one if its completely gone. you're cooked. What are you talking about if its partially there, you can still use it. (barely) by replacing the missing parts with solder. hold on. i got a pic"
ive replaced the missing part with some solder. you got an aio right?,"because you wanna get some high kv motors. and the size of your tinywhoop matters. how big / heavy is your whoop I have it all apart, no idea How do I change font size on Walksnail with betaflight, set it to large extra and it keeps resetting back to default"
try putting them all on a scale. in the osd menu check if the saving process finishes. question. ive set bluejay 24khz. should i also do motor pwm frequency 24khz?,no that's something completely different
where did you even get to that setting?,"btw. after not using the motors awhile, i have 2 that have suffered from storage damage or whatever you call it in english. is this too bad or still acceptable. hold on il send audio clip of every motor spinning up interesting. yeah don't touch it yeah i have another problem. beep             beep. after startup  :cry_about_it_c: I do not understand we’re do I have a missing part i asked if you had one Oh okay I do not think so"
"I think I find the problem, I did not have the half circle curve an instead more like a straight line up.

Just leave it as it is or should I try anything else, because I do not have any wire left really","Motors 1 to 4 in order the 5th one is master, meaning every motor at once Maybe best in this case just to make the cables go direct from motor to esc like this:"

Is it good to purchase from rdq rn?. Hurricane and stuff,no just buy from somewhere else probably. Here's a list. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623076796923928/1247237951113531434 While I’m at it how would I go about upgrading the antenna
is the pinecil still the recommended soldering iron to get?,Mobula 8. The range is really bad imo Skyzone cobra x. I believe v4. Or v3 what antennas on those No idea. The included ones probably want to upgrade those first
Ah. Wait is buying from wrekd ok?. Says the wear house is in Florida,they have an ohio warehouse and a florida one
"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) on the stack you recommended me, the ATF435 is it possible to change the startup sound?","just use esc-configurator also is it possible to set a speed limit without GPS. i know throttle limits exist but they dont work very well maximizing flight time and recording footage. like following a subject How do I fix this. Is it a soldering thing You cannot set a speed limit at all... The drone doesn't control that aspect@Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST). @ShoutMessage yes and yes, very easy Shit ok. I’ve never soldered before. Don’t even have an iron. Rahhhh. Fuck me. How would I go about fixing it You put some solder on the wire and some solder on the connector and then melt the two together. Thats actually a really easy job to start with. You need an iron tho, and flux, and solder Somewhere im sure there is, gimme a minute to find one https://oscarliang.com/soldering-guide/ np. https://pyrodrone.com/products/soldering-iron-tip-cleaner  https://pyrodrone.com/products/sequre-mini-sq-001-65w-portable-soldering-iron-w-ts-b2-tip-choose-color https://pyrodrone.com/products/pyrodrone-quad-solder-spool-63-37-0-8mm-100g https://pyrodrone.com/products/yosker-10ml-flux-pen. you can also get similar substitutes on amazon. just make sure its leaded solder and that the iron is one of those two button lcd screen varients im just gonna buy what you sent fair enough. i have that exact iron don't get that tip cleaner. is fake whuuuuut. idk about the flux pen. it was a random guess yeah the copper ones are for welding. the brass ones are for soldering"
what is even flex. dosent most solder already have it?,"flux is just a chemical that *basically* makes it easier for solder to soak and flow rosin core solder has some, but its useful to add some to your pads and wires first. i would say the solder itself is the fancy water haha ah. oh fiar. fair. welp i guess time to order and watch more monmey slip away :pensive_face: dude me too, im about to switch to elrs lmao. gonna be like 300 bucks probably owie. so should i order the  flux pen. and does it come witrh flux You can also get a little cup of it on Amazon. It would come with it. Doesn't really matter imo I have a few syringes of flux that I have, they work decent. Pen also works tho, I haven’t personally tried… but they sound easy is this any goodhttps://www.amazon.com/SEQURE-S99-Portable-Soldering-Kit/dp/B0D4DRY4TT/. id also get the actual solder and flux still though. OR SHOULD I JUST GO FOR THE OTHER SOLDERING IRON\ THATS WHAT I THOUGHT. oops caps Honestly for the price you can get a Pinecil overnighted on Amazon for 40 bucks and it is better value"
do i need other tips?. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet),TS-BC2 is nice. anything bigger with a flat tip pretty sure it comes witht hat'

Okay so you mean that they should go from the bottom and all the way up to the esc?,"I did leave some space for each wire if something did go wrong, is this fine to fly with or did I need to use something to protect the wires Run the wires on the bottom of the arms, away from potential prop strikes. That would be my advice, since you have left enough wire on em.. Those solder joints aren't the best, but they don't *look* insecure. I would, in the current circumstance of the machine."
This cable is little to long to use for my 3d print to my antenna I think. How can I solve it? The cable isn’t so moldable. (the sma cable),"Carefully coil it, then heat it **a little** with a lighter, then cable tying it is how I've done it before.  (Heating the cable a bit will make it tend to want to stay coiled up rather than fighting back all the time.). Be careful to coil it without kinking it though."
Do you have any image on how it should look?,"I don't think I do :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. Ideally, you should buy a shorter cable, but needs must sometimes.. Actually, in your case, you **ideally** want an antenna that'll mount straight to the VTx. I still need an adapter"
"Why?. That's an mmcx to sma pigtail, right?  Just get an mmcx antenna.. Example: https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/rushfpv-cherry-ii-58ghz-antenna-mmcxmmcx90-rhcplhcp",I have already this ones… I do not know if it is less expensive to buy new ones instead of an short adapter. Lollipop 4+
Where are you buying your parts from?,https://droneit.se/product/tbs-unify-pro-5g8-sma-pigtail-90mmcx/. Get that one.
That makes more sense? :yellow_heart:,Yes. A lot more sense Sweet. A picture says a thousand words and all that. :yellow_heart:
True. But would it really be long enough?,"I did try with my cable right know, and I’m not so sure"
How can I center this crosshair?,"Not sure, It's pointless anyway, the quad is *never* going straight forward like that. Right, I use it to reorient myself on a spot I'm aiming for but sure I'll disable it Get rid of anything you don't need off the OSD. Every element adds to CPU load more than you'd think. Everything else.. Mostly, the PID loop"
You use any other flight mode than acro?,"Horizon / Angle. Haven't picked a favorite yet You should be practicing with neither angle nor horizon really. Yeah, I am flying in my house as flying conditions outside are horrible right now, the sun is a lot like lava right now  I will use acro outdoors of course fair nuff :thumbs_up: No. It will only break everything.. Unless you need to update, don't."
"Okay, it's running 4.4 when I recieved it, I won't update then, but in what case should I update?","So, on your OSD you only need the warnings, per cell battery voltage, and flight mode. Everything else is superfluous to a whoop IMO.. You're not flying at range or great speed, so you don't need signal strengths, location readouts or anything else I can think of."
"With a highly integrated system like a whoop? Never, unless a critical bug is found with the standard setup.","Exceptions are racers and the like, who will want to supertune the machine. But they will understand the ramifications of doing so and how to handle things :yellow_heart: Yeah no I'm just a casual flyer. Sometimes cinematic Then you leave well alone and enjoy flying it my friend :yellow_heart: Yup, seems like the sun has set a little, might go fly for a bit. Still quite hot, hope the VTX doesn't decide to go kaboom Fly fast, keep it cool :winking_face: Hot outdoors air doesn't help No, it does not.. Thermodynamics is as much a bitch as gravity. Glad I studied physics.... Time to remove that throttle cap and go outdoors. Oh, what might help is if you turn the VTx power down as far as you can get away with. Less power used in the amp, less heat generated. I'm doing 25mw, I'm gonna be flying a straight lines for now until winter in a few weeks. Helps to have a really long street infront of your house with absolutely no cars That's exactly how I picture the middle east....how did you know https://tenor.com/bbwcB.gif :Harold:. Shouldn't that be a genie instead It's an undercover genie"
Also wouldn't it be better to have just one frequency?. Theoretically less heat beacause I'm Tx'ing on less channels,"I don't think that's what it means. Those are just all the channels and bands available for you to set your vtx to Alright I guess I'll leave it alone Yeah I don't do anything except bind the drone, set vtx up and map my switches."
"my friend just crashed my drone, and now my lipo is deformed, what do i do with it?","You send pictures of your lipo so we can ~~make fun of it~~ judge how much it is broken and if it is still flyable can someone with a walksnail avatar pro measure the thickness of this part of the antenna for me please idk the drone took off without the battery straps so the props are destroyed you think you could get any further away, i can still see the battery yea i know i took this picture earlier. its still outside and i dont want to go get it. but the you could look inside the cells i dont think its flyable anymore does anyone know what ELRS antenna [this](https://flywoo.net/products/firefly-1s-fr16-nano-baby-quad-analog-v2.0-bnf) drone comes with and if it will have any range decrease compared to the antenna that comes with the radiomaster RP1"
ufl ?. since most whoops are too tiny for sma,there shouldnt be any difference tho. are you talking about elrs cnnector or vtx so is the antenna on the RP1. ELRS there shouldnt be any difference. it more on depends on your elrs module on your radio im just wondering i broke the antenna that came with the RP1 and had to take the antenna from the micro drone
oh. so the picture antenna is the new one or broken one?,"oh that should be fine. you wont have any problems with this one this is the RP1 antenna :thumbs_up:. both work fine so you wont have any range decrease, there might be a mili or centimeter difference but other than that. you fine Funny place to store a lipo yea no one wanted to touch it so this was the best option If you know any elrs RX that uses an sma, I would love to see it yeah i missed that part. wait. what if you use a ufl to sma connector. it should be somewhere :index_pointing_up: :nerd_face: The sma isn't on the revejver it is if i tape it to the rx Less people but I still see quite a few lr people use it Especially for 900mhz what if you strap this boi to a big enough long range drone. ultimate flight duration They just add an sma next to the antenna so they can use a nicer antenna that sticks out further up. Not necessarily, there's a lot of useless weight here Voltage is also fairly important, but your quad would end up being stupid big to actually work decently with it. And finding decent motors and props that would be big and efficient enough might be challenging the internal BMS will cut of power on your first punch out Does anyone know of any good bnf digital fpv drones How do I disable these d-pad things. for whatever reason they are linked to stick inputs like some kind of offset. pushing it up raises throttle are they able to be disabled Just don't touch them i figured out hwo to disable them Maybe make this a #help-with-drones post so different people can recommend different quads"
Chris rosser has an in depth guide on it. https://youtu.be/sNAV4gx_gBY?si=KcoXyFSxIlpmh-Ux,how can i get my vifly finder 2 working. i have it set in betaflight to go off when holding a switch down but it doesnt work. none of it works idk if its the cable im using or what
"wow that is... tightly packed. probably nothing would happen, but why not just put some insulator between?",Ye ill take some electrical tape down makes sense.
"stupid question but is it possible to disable the like, “manual?” take off on a dji mini 2?",yeah its just 2 plugs. i havent gotten it to beep at all I've not bought a finder 2 in a few years but they used to come as 1 plug with three wires. Black (ground) Red (5v) Yellow (goes to BZ- pad on FC)  The FC can't make it beep without the yellow wire and the propper pad (or a remapped LED pad.)  But if you have the gnd and 5v connected. And give it 5v for a while to charge. Then when you disconnect the 5v power it should begin its beeping cycle for the lose model feature.
"*knowing what trims are makes me old???* :PepeComfyCry:. also, question for yall. how would yall go about mounting VTX and RX antennae on this thing?. the VTX antenna I have has a decent length of coax, probably ~5""?. I think my RX antenna is pretty short so I might just mount the receiver itself wherever I want the antenna to be, and have long wires going to the reciever (would that be a bad idea for any reason? does noise affect the RX-FC connection?)","typically voltage scale craziest thing ive ever heard someone call trims. i guess we're to the point where people havent needed trim for so long and quads have been around for so long its not important And im not even old lmao I'm so out of touch with post-2020 FPV I'm like a superboomer here I don't think noise would really mess with that serial connection but you can twist your power wires. Im a bit better now but thats how i felt too a few months ago lol I'd probably braid all 4 wires cause i wanna make V2 of this thing actually super tidy lol Im not really sure how that effects rf tbh. Itll probably be fine I wanna get a few of my projects up and running so that I can actually go out and fly on my freetime, so I might as well get reacquainted with how a quad works lol Why not just have the antennas all sticking out up top. Yerp I'm considering that, just having them all next to the center stack thing. just a little concerned about them being near the props and being RF-blocked by CF, but I might be overthinking those two factors i really just forgot the name of it :loudly_crying_face: I gotta do some work on my tools so they all work when i need them. Namely this printer"
my Ender 3 pro V1 wich everyone has terrible luck with just sits in a corner till i need it and then it works fine :KEKw:. I have the most random luck with tools. (I still don't own a single functional pair of flush cutters??),"VTX probably sticking out the top and RX (assuming you mean like ELRS) id put the antenna at the rectangle end of an arm. i currently have my ELRS receiver taped on to my arm without issue. Held together by zip-ties, electrical tape, and hopes and dreams im gonna eat up like a foot and a half x4 of 22gauge wire doing that :PepeKEKhands:. plus not sure if magnetic/RF interference would be a problem with that length of serial connection could do it here or just anywhere on the main part of the frame tbh. you got a lot of room to work with"
too much room lol. good ideas though. maybe I'm overthinking how much CF would block the signal?,"well if the antenna is on the bottom it shouldnt be an issue since the drone will be above you 99.9% of the time. assuming CF is carbon fiber I had this ""great idea"" to route the receiver serial wires through the arm and have them exit the arm to the receiver like half the length down the arm... just remembered that that'd compromise the strength of the arm to put a hole it it for the wires lol. that's actually a great idea, I'll probably mount everything on the bottom then. yknow I could mount the vtx antenna shooting off of the main center square thing forwards, at a 45 degree angle of depression"
thats actually awful :face_with_tears_of_joy:. do they stay when you move the camera?. does the osd display over or under them,"Yes, the OSD displays under them, and they do change when you move the quad At the start, they weren't there. Let me try to get you a clip those two things were not expected to go together. if the osd is under them, it must not be from the camera. if it changes when the quad moves, its probably the camera. really strange. and it shows up in dvr. is that analog or digital If it helps, it's quite hot, but the conditions are bare minimum acceptable for a VTX to not kill itself  Analog. I was far away thus the interferance / low signal, just ignore that"
wtf. and youre sure its over the OSD?,"~~I think there's some confusion with what ""over"" means in thise case lol~~ Let me show you one moment which one is on bottom if youre looking at the stack from the top-->down lol Oh wait I worded that incorrectly. The dots DO display under the OSD that makes way more sense lol. its the camera. sensor might just be dying"
Too bright conditions? I mean it still works fine,"A normal intact camera wont do that. But if it works youre obviously welcome to keep using it I'll still order a new C03 as a backup Benefit of analog. May as well I wonder if those artifacts are actually just how overly extremely ""bright"" spots get encoded, transmitted, and received (as opposed to the problem being the sensor itself) Honestly analog is quite nice tbh, even though I don't like the quality too much it still is very nice, I was able to go pretty far Possible. I keep going back and forth, but i haven't tried digital so i cant compare just thinking of the artifacts I'd get while decoding cats' stuff a while ago lol :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
"I guess that I should use Video, CRSF TX 1, 7 - 26V IN, and GND but which GND should I chose?",Doesn't matter. They're probably both connected together.. You could check with a multimeter in continuity mode.
Is your Rx connected to U1?,I'm not too sure like
"And your VTx to u6?. That's what you're configuring things as, so if that's not where you connected it, it won't work, see?. Tick the serial Rx thing on the uart where you connected the Rx.","Right so, it seems to have RX4-5-6 and so on right, i take it that whichever number this says will correspond to the UART number Just show me the soldering. also seems that whenever i save and reboot my uart settings in betaflight it just doesnt do it Right, so the Rx is on U1.. And the VTx is on U6"
We’re is rx on the VTX?,"VTX only had smartaudio going to TX6, for the elrs receiver i did tx-rx rx-tx now it seems if i select those options in betaflight. save and reboot. it doesnt apply them"
Is it the first wire?,Looks like it. Hmmm. That's usually because something isn't right somewhere.
On the vtx. So the tx on the vtx should not be used?,My FC does only have TX not RX
Shouldn’t I look at the TBS VTX?,You asked where the u6 connections are to connect Rx and Tx. There they are. seems like just applying the rx forthe elrs receiver works
"Oh, okay. But when I’m connecting my VTX should I connect it in the same way they do with TBS VTX?",Because you're trying to enable MSP and VTX on the same UART excellent. So we now know it's the VTx config that's throwing it for a loop.
So what would i do now?,Do NOT tick the MSP slider on u6. Just select the VTx from the dropdown on the right hooray it applied. we're in business
"Break things into smaller steps to see where the problem lies, y'see?","The VTX table may be wrong depending on how new this VTX is. the power levels specifically Yeah, loading the right VTx table is a whole other thing :confused_face:"
eeehhh no. wait what VTX are you running?,found that table on the webs two people at the same time xD. sec. yeah same issue applies tbh. in BF Presets tab. search for Rush
there is preset tab?. there is,and then Save and Reboot
Can I connect my TBS unify VTX we’re the Caddax unit should go?,you've got the same fc as me. wagwan
What are you trying to achieve by wiring it to where the Caddx air unit would be wired?,"The Caddax unit has RX doesn't matter, you're wiring up SmartAudio not CRSF Okay, so it should work like they do on the image with tbs unify. But RX should go to TX I guess +VTX to 7V-26V GND to GND VTX to Video TX6 to RX1 (SA). remove the rest from the connector. !repin https://youtu.be/fh9gvhobVro @wilmer also there seems to be some warning in regards to VTX power, it may be controlled with some solder bridge. Make sure you're not trying to give the VTX 5V. I can't see the whole thing so idk I think they was already done: @cyberFluke sorry I barged in so hard :harold: Saw things I knew were not right and my brain wanted to fix them asap xD. yeah that's set to 10V, always on (no pit switch) Good timing, my brain wants to Velocidrone. We all good matey :red_heart: haha. enjoy :slightly_smiling_face:"
Maybe better to have the vtx above the capacitor and the cables?,Should I just cut the red and black cable in order to remove them from the red thing yeah. same for the pin on the end of yellow That or resolder the XT60 pigtail to angle the cabling upwards a little to avoid the VTx.. Doesn't look to be enough room above the power cabling either to be honest I think this looks better
"You just gonna use VHB tape to stick it on?. You do have some VHB tape, right? :winking_face:","Cable ties, like my friend did Oof. It'll work, but that's pretty far from ideal.. It *should* be literally bolted to the frame. That is not possible even with the bottom plate TBS went off trail and decided to make all their hardware fit some proprietary sizing in some gormless last gasp attempt to lock people into their ecosystem.  You need an adapter bracket to mount it to a non TBS frame. :Harold:. TBS is rapidly becoming a brand to avoid.. While it's true that ""some people"" will keep buying their stuff off the TBS name alone, it's the same sort of market segment that try to claim FrSky is better than ELRS, so it's a limited group. :KEKw:. Give it a year or so, and newbies won't even know who TBS are. Thanks for the information, very happy that I did buy from they know :slightly_smiling_face: TBS VTX's are still pretty good. but like.. yeah.. they could at least make them fit well in their own frames :KEKw:. also I know exactly how that will break :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. been there, done that No argument here, but they're not progressing or innovating, they're complacent and belligerent as a company now. That's the death knell in a fast moving industry like this one."
"Okay, do I need only to solder the xt60 cables or the capacitor also?","I would resolder the power wires to be more vertical, even more sideways. (to get them out of the side of the drone, which usually makes for an easier time with batts) Just keep em away from the prop disc. yup, I usually strapped the battery cable down together with the battery"
Way would not the back work?,"It would, but you can see the difficulties it can cause first hand. Make the cables go out from the back of the drone instead of side ways Shit gets in the way :KEKw: they get in the way of the VTX antenna, and you tend to end up with a battery wire hump. lemme dig some ancient photos up I've taken to having *just* enough power lead to have the xt connector pinned in by the top frame panel.. A cable tie round the lead under the frame (with a bit of cable tie tail folded between the xt30 pins to avoid deforming the connector when tightening the retaining tie) I ended up doing most of my builds this way because I kept having battery snag issues xD. that feeling when you fly through a branch and it yanks the battery out by the battery cable xD lol, yeah, I can see how that could be a problem.. Suddenly; flying dead stick, blind. GG. This seems we’re close oh lol while scrolling I found a beautiful photo :PepeBigHmm:. That looks like a great story waiting to be told xD I can't even recall how I crashed it. been years ago. OH WAIT I DO NOW. Powerlooped a metal bar. a couple times too many for my luck yeah the most fun part was taking it apart (loooong screws)"
Do you think this will work?,test it with your batteries. see if you can plug it in and strap down well. I didn't come up with my solution to my particular build on first try
"Servos.  I know nothing, but need a tiny one to strap to the back of an FPV cam to make an adjustable angle mount. Any pointers?. For reference: this to make a simple single axis (Y, pitch) remotely adjustable mount for a Walksnail camera.  The difficult bit is making it fit in the nose of a Volador VX3.5 frame.. The reason: mostly confidence, or lack thereof. Bit of safety's sake too really.  I fly at an unreasonable cam angle, and until I have the confidence, would like to be able to drop the angle so I can see wtf I'm going at very low speeds.","I can’t get my black wire off, I have tried everything. Flux, 400 degrees"
What soldering iron are you using?,I’m using a TS101 or what do you mean
what are you powering the TS101 from?,"My school laptop charger. I think I did cook the charger. 45W If it can't melt that joint, it sounds like it can't put out enough power.  The difficulty you're having is that the ground/-ve connection is connected to a massive plane of copper inside the board that doubles as a heatsink for the ESCs. this makes it somewhat tricksy to solder as the heat you're putting in is just getting dissapated by the heatsink layer. So I need a better power source I think so.. The TS101 will do up to 60W IIRC. That missing 15W is what's holding you back I reckon.. 65W capable.. ie. a 6S LiPo :winking_face:. That'll fettle the bastard :PepePyro:"
"Okay, how do you mean with melt I more?. Melt it longer?","I can melt it but the cable is still stuck Melt it more, add a little bit of fresh solder. hold the iron there longer. There's a delicate balance to be found with how much heat to apply"
"hi, my edgetx screen doesnt show the stick movement anymore. there is just the model name, battery and trim. the rest is blank. how do I fix that???","Press the page button is dynamic VTX and ELRS power any good. ELRS maybe considering battery life. but with a VTX on a drone your motors use 100x more power than your VTX Since ELRS 3.0, dynamic TX power has been very good"
do i just set it to Dyn or an aux port?,"Battery life and heat are one set of reasons. just dyn. it will activate when armed. (so it requires your arming switch to be set up correctly, as per ELRS docs). anyway, RF is another consideration entirely. In RF reflective environments, more power can be worse i think i got mine at 250hz, 250mW that is fairly typical. most people run dynamic to save on battery life. it also helps you to not screech I AM FLYING A DRONE across the whole city lol also what data does telemetry provide whatever the receiver provides (signal statistics, input voltage, etc) + whatever the FC provides (battery voltage, various power statistics, speeds, heading, coordinates, etc). Here's BF stuff:  https://betaflight.com/docs/development/telemetry#available-sensors. ah wait that's FRSKY. ehhh. where crsf... eh, whatever, it's probably similar. https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/guides/current/Telemetry#crossfire-protocol--crsf. ah here it is"
Most durable 5” drone frames for bando flying?,"Is this bad or will it work. (the black cable) it doesn't really look attached not enough heat, small soldering iron tip, bad solder. Ummagawd Demibot maybe FlyFish Volador VX5. and the SupaFly Flipmode/Syncmode. @wilmer it should look more like this"
Can you give me a range?,I'm asking you. how cheap do you want it to be I’m not sure how cheap just not too cheap to be shit but still decent the Volador VX5 is $70. like 20 bucks cheaper than the demibot yeah. the top could be a little smoother but that's definitely fine to fly Something in the TBS source 1 series. Or something from sabotage RC. the Source One is great but not really a frame for bando bashing
"Hey guys, when i crash my mob6 or flip it upside down, the motors start accelerating even though i dont put any throttle to it. How can i fix this or is the drone just messed up?","you're supposed to disarm it when you crash True, but it also happens when i flip, like i tried doing a powerloop on the washing line and it just accelerated into the floor"
sounds more like gravity. are you maybe used to flying in a sim with not-so-realistic physics and a stronger quad?,I do usually fly a 5” irl and i use liftoff. That could be why. My main drone is a monster tbf yeah whoops fall a lot quicker. you need to catch it very early
Are you in an NFZ or something or have a sensor issue?,"Had something weird happen to me right now at an event. Dji mavic 3 pro with rc pro remote. Random descendent and I cannot throttle out of it.. Just came down on its own twice, re calibrated all settings and still will fly briefly than start to come down"
did the descend start over land or water?,Over land both times. Flying same location as yesterday and didn't have this issue all day
do you have the logs of that specific flight?,"well i dont have a mavic pro but i do have a mavic air. Sometimes the drone wants to land showing a red bar, signaling a sudden voltage drop. Another reason the Drone just starts decending is when a signal gets misread or it looses connection temporarily. But for those reasons you should check your Settings.. ""signal gets misread"" (i think thats a reason). am not even sure if thats possible but. could be Ty I'll double check everything. It's possible it was the geo or something was incorrect that might also be a reason. but dji doesnt just make your drone land if you enter a forbidden geozone.. instead it issues a warning or flies it back to base"
Yo after a crash my motor doesnt spinn right and now it not spinning and i tried with another motor but its still doesnt work can someone help me?,what steps did you already try other than that Trying to rotate the motors in bf and idk
@Typo i don't see why not lol. @Scootzronnn @Scootzronnn send a video.  Does the motor feel smooth when you spin it by had? Does it wobble?,"Would it be alright if I stuck a micro vtx to an aio fc, it would be shrink wrapped aswell. This would be for a 2s build using the mob8 frame, I already have an old fc so that’s why I’m not using one that already has a vtx built in. The vtx is a TBS Unify pro32 nano If you've replaced the motor with a new one (or known good one) and the problem remains, then the problem likely lies with the ESC. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:. I hope it's not an AIO"
Is it a good idea to add heat shrink on my ELRS RX?,Yea no downside to it tbh then why add extra weight and stuff that can come loose and break other things
did you read heat sink?,https://tenor.com/view/indignation-jump-window-done-gif-3443826
okay thanks. 1103 like the mob 8 would be best im guessing. what KV would you recommend?,"yeah tbh I'd just spec it like the Mobula 8. it's really good okay will do. basically what im going for. with a couple of old parts I have lying around :face_with_tears_of_joy: That's personally my favorite size for a 2"" 2s, 1002 and 1102 works well too, but 1003 just has an awesome responsiveness with some gemfan 2023. 10000kv/12000kv, I use 11kkv"
"alright nice, Ive wanted a whoop for a while so thats goot to hear. you use the happymodel motors?","Yeah, but the bearings are a little on the fragile side"
does that matter that much since its a whoop?,"I mainly use them because they are really light and happymodel motors are fairly efficient. Not as much, I use it on an open prop so they are more exposed, but if you use it on a whoop frame it's fine aah alright I get you. fairly priced too. Thank you guys for the help. really appreciate it @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks)@Vitroid"
Is it normal for my drone to be hitting 70 degrees celsius?,"I still have 3 1103 11k kv betafpv motors If they are on the bench without a fan blowing at them, yeah (always point a fan at your electronics when on the bench) if you aren't flying fast they also can go to 70°c without it being an issue But you can only buy 4 at a time Ahh that might be why i keep getting a failsafe"
do you know the name of the option?,i am guessing it is called throttle percentage already looked for soemthing like that. didnt find it i just looked and it is just pretty much right there
why would you need a betaflight cli dump for your receiver?. what are you trying to do?,Idk. Im trying to see if i need any files on my RX/ i mean you can update it if you want
Can i just bind the RX and be ready to go?,it's good to learn the updating and putting a bind phrase in it. since it'll become the fastest way once you know
Is the AIO upside down?,"@Sohail show me the actual quad, with the arrow on the AIO either visible, or indicated on the image. :yellow_heart:. From that I can tell you what orientation BF needs. Ye the aio is upside down. When the quad is on the table.. The arrow is where my screw driver is on the bottom side of the aio"
"Arrow on the silkscreen pointing forwards, yeah?",It's under the silicone yes but not on this side of the aio. The side you can see is the bottom and the top is facing the table
What are the default orientation numbers in BF?,No bother. You should just be able to add 180° to the roll. Calibrate the gyro after you've set it and rebooted. quad is no upside down in the 3d model.
After you've set that one to 180° and calibrated it (on a flat surface)?,standby. ye that worked. thank you sir :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
and it goes solid when you turn the radio back on?,soooo. it's bound. and it's connecting successfully. your issue is most likely elsewhere
"arming, disarming is not related to the receiver connecting properly. Radio -> Transmitter -> (radio frequencies) -> Receiver -> Flight Controller. The transmitter and receiver just move the data from one place to the other. the radio is responsible for assembling the data. and the flight controller is responsible for interpreting it. BUT. > Why does the radio not show that it is connected?. this is more interesting. what do you mean by that",It won’t let me bind at all
"If it’s listening, shouldn’t the radio show it’s connected and shouldn’t it let me control drone?",the drone decides whether it wants to be controlled or not I haven’t been able to do that yet
apparently you did it?. I guess you set the same bind phrase?,you keep omitting the important part Connect to the drone. I am so confused
"Yeah I can see that. Let's deal with the assumptions first. 1) ""Why does the radio not show that it is connected?"". elaborate on this. what do you expect to see, where",I expect to see the little bars that show how good the connectivity of the drones RX to be there
Am i able to use the radio for the sim withought batteries?. Without*,"what radio, generally no(t easily) no clue about that one unfortunately, but still, probably no Normally, you would unplug and plug in a power source into your drone 3 times and then the radio will show a C that it’s connected, but when I do this process nothing happens with my radio"
okay I have a good enough idea of what's up I think. turn the radio off. **then** power up the receiver. and let it go to wifi mode. then connect to its wifi. do you know how to get through that to the webui?,I want screenshots of the webui I’ve done that multiple times today. Okay
one of them should show the header. I want the main page and the Model page. Model and Options then. why is it not on latest ELRS?. I need to see all of the options on the pages btw. no other settings on Model page?,"ehh where was it.... sec short for wait a second this is what I was looking for :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. btw power up your radio and show me the ExpressLRS Lua. top & bottom of it. @CoasterJoint basically, to me it seems like the receiver is just not sending telemetry back. A) it's turned off on the receiver B) it's turned off somehow on the radio C) the receiver has the wrong firmware"
"That’s also through Wi-Fi, correct?","no. the menu in which you see the C in the top right. or, don't. SYS -> TOOLS -> ExpressLRS. HAH. Telem ratio: Off. didn't realise that option existed. but it makes sense ig. set it to Std. basically, the radio is telling the receiver: DON'T TALK TO ME @CoasterJoint that should solve your ""no C"" and ""no bars"" issue It did, yet it still won’t let me arm"
"Okay this makes so much sense. So all I have to do is just do the whole beta flight thing, correct?",It's like HEY I PUT THE ENGINE IN THE CAR  why won't it start  wiring harness: not connected gas tank: empty keys: not registered
Do you see inputs in BF Receiver tab?. (moving sticks moves bars in BF Receiver tab),"make sure the receiver is actually connected to the radio, will need a power cycle to get out of wifi mode. Betaflight Configurator, Receiver tab"
"Hey good afternoon experts  So I can definitely afford and willing to invest in the Mini 4 Pro, but I was thinking—there’s no way I’m dropping that much on a drone when I haven’t flown one in two years. I don’t want to crash it! I really want to get back into drones, but do it right this time. Before, I was just buying cheap ones for fun, but now I want to get into good camera drones.  So for now, I’m sticking with DJI. For a first drone to get some practice and get the hang of it again, I’m thinking of going with the Mini 2 SE.  Am i choosing something right here? Do I have the right idea? Please drop ur ideas and even suggestions! :EmoteeDoubleCool:",This might get better coverage in #camera-drones :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. That's where more of the DJI flying folk hang out
"okay, did you wire up the receiver yourself?","Well, there wasn’t any soldering involved, it was just plug in"
"does this go to DJI O3?. if yes, can you confirm that there's only 4 wires in it?","Yes. There is 4 wires. My original drone had the extra two okay so that shouldn't cause any annoyign issues. yeahh. that's exactly what I was looking out for :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: you wouldn't happen to have a manual for that FC. I wanna check the wiring before I move on I did depin them because I was trying to switch to elrs. I don’t have one yeah, good job, saves me time should be this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gqvq0CFEl5mI6o-odz3eDQkw3ZEfaIQ-/view I have mine wired up exactly the same thx. @CoasterJoint send a screenshot of BF Ports tab and Receiver tab (technically speaking I'm asking for BFC but that tends to confuse people even more). we're very close btw :winking_face:. but I am also very close to bed :face_with_tears_of_joy: Sorry my discord is lagging okay this'll require an extra step. Go to presets tab. there, in the top right, is a Save Backup button. use it to sasve a backup and post it here Okay. In a sec, my computer just glitched out ok looks like a valid backup. click Disconnect. then go to Firmware Flasher. there, click Auto-detect. you should end up with something like this The auto detect isn’t working Annoying. Then just set it up manually. Verify that the name matches up what you see in the backup. the version is slightly newer, you do want that for the bugfixes. > board_name IFLIGHT_BLITZ_F435. uhh. sec, I just realised this is a very nonstandard board for me. there will be a small YOLO part to this. we need to change the FC's firmware to get CRSF support. but it's using a AT32 chip, not STM32. so the normal driver fixer won't work. So let's hope we don't need it.. tell me if you're keeping up @CoasterJoint xD Ok cool. at the very bottom of BF. click Load Firmware [Online]. and then Flash Firmware. if it warns you about making a backup, you already made one the flashing process should show a moving progress bar... usually. it shouldn't get stuck at ""initiating reboot"" if it does, tell me. I'm digging up AT32 drivers already https://tenor.com/view/that70s-show-kitty-drinks-drinking-day-chill-gif-16669162. 1min that should let you get into DFU"
"Download that @CoasterJoint. Inside is Artery_DFU_DriverInstall. there is a .exe file with the same name. run that. it JUST finished downloading for me from their official site ffs. @CoasterJoint Once the damn Artery DFU drivers are installed, replug the drone and retry the flashing process. is this a very delayed upload? :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:",Idk. It’s still says that
so restart this procees again?,"*yes, give me even less feedback* Imma write the entire summary here:  Install the Artery DFU drivers as described above.  Then, replug the drone's USB.  Then, run the flashing process.   If it fails to flash (get stuck at reboot), restart your PC and retry.   After successfully flashing, connect to the drone in BF.  It may nag about lack of configuration. Ignore it. Go to Presets tab, click Load Backup, and load the backup you made previously.   After loading the backup (it should restart the drone), go to Receiver tab.   In Receiver tab, change the Receiver provider from SBUS to CRSF.  Then, click Save & Reboot. After this you SHOULD see inputs in Receiver tab :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: (because it will have the right firmware and protocol). I'm not exactly familiar with the specifics of DFU on Artery FC's... unfortunately. everything was STM until it suddenly wasn't .D This is what it looks like after 5 minutes @The GGManiack"
It's not about time. it gets stuck at this phase because it can't detect the device. waiting won't change anything. Is this after installing the Artery drivers & restarting PC? @CoasterJoint,"should probably make a ! command with the suspicious drivers for artery. at least the url is simple. <https://www.arterychip.com/file/download/1764> can you show what shows up in device manager it's a program. comes with windows. it could really be under any of those but open up `computer, firmware, ports, software devices and the USB ones` Nothin there that stood out What exactly am I looking for you can just send a screenshot with all of them open but if you want to learn. it's either going to be something marked with ""artery"" the company or it's going to be an unkown device with a yellow triangle. you have it plugged in right :thinkies:"
are you sure you installed the drivers correctly?,"I don’t know. I just downloaded it well you have to download it, then open the file and then in there there will be a folder with a program you need to run. highlighted"
how do I do that? and also I wasn't able to find the download for BF,this should be the layout for outwards props right They connect I just can't get the drone to arm do you have the switch and receiver set up in BF
assuming youre on windows. https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/download/10.10.0/betaflight-configurator_10.10.0_win64-installer.exe. plug your drone in to your pc and connect to it with betaflight then go to your receiver tab and make sure the drone picks up the inputs of the remote. @𝒜.𝒞𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒𝓁 were you able to solve it?,it picks up. it seems delayed it shouldnt be delayed during flight. go to the modes tab and press add range on the arm option. the click the AUTO dropdown and move the switch you want to use. move the range bar so that when you have the switch in the arm position the vertical yellow line is within the bar and when its in the unarm position is out of the bar. armed on the left unarmed on the right. your bar shouldnt move how i moved mine i just did that since i dont have a radio connected yeah. you should be good to fly now since its already picking up your radio but id add another range to switch to angle mode if its your first time flying i have angle mode and horizon mode already there i dont see acro tho acro is the default when you arent in angle or horizon mode ohhhh idk why that blew my mind for a sec
if you want to be extra safe in angle mode you can set a limit for how much the drone can tilt. should be good. so when youre out of the range of those 2 you will be in acro mode. @𝒜.𝒞𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒𝓁 how you flown any sim at all?,yes i did racing drone sims at school and picked up on it pretty fast and i got about 30hrs at home with a sim. so i got about a month on sim nice you should be good to fly then
do you have a bind phrase set on the radio?. or any way of checking the radio is connected to the drone,when I turn the drone and the radio on the led on the drone stays steady and when I had it connected to BF it was responding to the radio
did you get any  warmings on the OSD. such as the angle being too steep or the throttle not being at 0?,I got the angle being steep I don't think anything with the throttle either level the drone or change the max arm angle
"getting back into FPV from 7 years ago, wondering if a 4 in 1 radio and adding ELRS nano module is the best all around solution? or is ELRS the only way to go?",unless you need all the other protocols id go just for ELRS. most new drones will either be ELRS or have the option to get an ELRS model when buying the drone
the digital or analog version?,"fatshark released 2 models with the same name. one is analog and the other uses walksnail and is digital i bought these. https://rotorvillage.ca/fat-shark-dominator-avatar-hd-fpv-goggles/ I was thinking about getting the box one for my ciniwhoop thats the avatar/digital version this is the flag im getting so youll need to buy a walksnail VTX or a drone with one. go in to your modes and remove the prearm range thats what i kinda gathered RX_FAILSAFE and MSP just show up when connected to betaflight. you need to disconnect it to arm your drone i ended up with the radiomaster Zorro 4 in 1, with ELRS Nano module, since its able to do 1 watt with the module, and if needed and still run old school RX's. instead of only 100mw"
do i keep flip over after crash? thats just turtle mode right?,yeah its an automatic turtle mode. i personally dont like/use turtle mode as ive heard it can break your ESC. if the motors encounter any resistance like a rock or twig its over from my understanding thanks for answering the newb questions @Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST). :thumbs_up: no problem :thumbs_up: congrats man. have fun flying :PepeHypers:
Tbh it looks fine from the video... Does it smell sweet?,Not really. Oh wait. Little bit
Do you have a proper case to charge batteries in?,Not in. But i have a safe way to store them
"where is the best place to have the ELRS receiver if I have two antennas, and was thinking of making the antennas to go to two diffrent arms?","Yep, that works.. VHB tape the Rx to the frame top plate is an oldie but goodie.. I like the Volador frame for the little bracket to hold the Rx under the VTx behind the arms."
"But would it be better to make a 3d print for it, like under the SMA antenna 3d print?","I have source one v5 frame Ideally, you want one antenna vertical and one horizontal on a diversity setup like that.. Someone will have already designed one for the source one. Hit up Google :winking_face: SMA yes, but not dual for the ELRS. I did find one that was selling like the 3d printed but not stl"
What is the most durable 85mm whoop frame?,I was thinking of having first the sma and under the SMA two elrs antennas with 45 degress angel from the middle cnc cut from carbon fiber
as in like prop screws?,It eats plastics slowly. You do not want it near the locking disc in locknuts or props.. Makes em go brittle.
Something like this maybe?,"It would work, for sure. You're adding mass with every chunk of TPU though, and tying them to the back quad arms will get the same orientation of antennas. :yellow_heart:. Making a little holder for the Rx though, that'd be a smart move. 'Specially if you can find a way of holding it inside the frame boundaries so it's crash protected. if you're taking apart and reassembling a motor (removing the bell from the stator) and the bell is held in by a screw (not a c-clip), then a tiny bit of blue loctite can be used on the screw.   if you're asking about anything relating to propellers/propeller shafts - GOD NO"
"So i brock a motor ok my 5” quad and i want to replace him, do you think that the second cable is short or its fine?. Because it’s touching on the side of the solder and not on top",It'd be under a lot of tension. Better to extend it
can i power the whoopstor by using a 60w phone charger?,"If it supports USB PD, sure"
Is it good?. And then like this?,no the screw that holds the bell on No. Cut the short cable even shorter and then extend it yea that's what I've done thanks (locking bell on) Yeah. Put heatshrink on it
"Hello fpv friends Can you help me please?:skull_and_crossbones::exploding_head::folded_hands::folded_hands::folded_hands: I crashed with my drone and then i tried to fly again another day, but it wont arm , but the reciever jumper t pro was connected with my nazgul v3, in betaflight is no stick reaction to see but it is everything connected.

I need your help!!:folded_hands::folded_hands::folded_hands: Thank you!!","Maybe, I was thinking of having the elrs receiver right above my vtx Hi I wanted to ask if a 5“ 4s walksnail would have enough power to freestyle"
One last question does anyone have good settings for the Caddx baby ratel 2 ?,"5"" 4S was the standard for many years, even on very heavy builds. 6S nowadays costs the same so there isn't really much of a point to buying into  4S."
set it to a higher packet rate?,max out the baud rate (5.25M) and max out the packet rate (F1000) this is for Land RC but since it uses EdgeTX I though the FPV folks would know much more. I think the limitation is the digital servo Hz
we don't really deal with servos much here. are they PWM/PPM servos?,"the testing video was set to F1000 TX side and the RX was 333hz on each channel.. let me check I'm asking if you're not running something slightly unusual (SBUS servos or similar) I don't think so let me check the servo I am planning on getting.. it's a 3 wire servo if that helps either way honestly I don't think latency with servos was given much consideration, given how slow servos usually are xD"
how does sub-100ms latency matter in that. aren't you looking more for rate of change?,"20ms is fast enough just was curious if I could push out more speed. At that point I'd be more interested in feedforward than latency ig :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. hmm fair.. the servo is a 333hz refreshrate anyway honestly, this is a question much better asked in the ELRS server :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: and the testing was F1000 with the channel rate at 333hz."
"the 20ms, is that a complete system latency?",from transmitter to the servo yeah.
stick to servo movement?. did you check the latency of the servo itself?. or latency of when the output makes it out of the receiver. I'm wondering how much latency the servo itself adds,"or, how slow the ELRS PWM implementation is :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. both are unknowns rn"
"the cables go like this, right?",hard to say without a pinout i'll just drop the link. https://www.agf-rc.com/AGFRC-A50BHL-Low-Profile-Programmable-Servo-p2216037.html Round is ground. That's how I recall it. Rounded side of the connector is the ground. the pinout is written on the other side was just about to say that. frankly it should have pinout on both sides
ty. also where is positive on the bt2.0 connector?,I would say the Blue wire is the positive but best to just test the voltage with a multimeter. the rounded side.. the square side is positive I think.
okay. is there a fast way to cool down my soldering iron?. i want to change the tip,Blow on it. Or use some pliers to remove the hot tip and lay it on a heat-resistant surface yoooo why tuning is such a long process motor go brr. software go :loudly_crying_face: no. it's not conductive yet you need to make sure to clean any left flux after soldering - as much as i know it can make problems in the board itself but mostly it's aesthetics some kinds are. some kinds are corrosive. check if you have no-clean flux i'm thinking about giving uppp fr
i think my drone has a bad version of elrs. it doesnt bind. how do i change it..?,eventually you'll get good at it i have elrs configurator but idk how to use it theres a process before just powering on the elrs and flying. the best guide i had was this[https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/getting-started/]
also idk what version my radio has :loudly_crying_face:. ?,if theres something unclear ask but besides that its really the best guide i kinda dont know what to look at in order. top to buttom you. read the page. that was sent. it quite literally explains to you. what to look at
EdgeTX is the software that runs on the radio (when switched on).  You're using the software on the radio to reach the Tx module.. Does that information render the question moot?,why doesnt my drone power up through usb  :stare:. i hope iso alc will fix it
"The FC, the VTx, or the ESC?. ""The Drone"" as a whole needs more power than USB can supply.","In a lot of cases USB power won't even get to peripherals like a GPS module. the aio. it doesnt give signs of live through usb Oh, an AIO.  Well, that's not a good sign. Check the cable first. iso alc will fix it iso alc will fix it iso alc will fix it iso alc will fix it"
is iso alc conductive?. 99%,"No, but the contaminants it picks up might well be. Same as water. YES. ISO ALC FIXED IT"
what did i do wrong..?,"Detritus on the PCB, washed off by the IPA. I can only imagine the work area. :confused_face: have betaflight configurator open i assume the guide does tell you not to do that y'know"
Looks like the radio can't see the module. Is it active? (Internal and external modules can be disabled in the radio/model settings),"Never mind. If only people could somehow deduce meaning from all these symbols in this ""manual"" thing.... It would change the world. ""alphabet"". doesn't even sound real Just an FYI to those that refuse to read an effin' manual, those that ask questions that later turn out to be explained by the documentation for a thing, those that do before reading then claim you didn't;  **WE ALL SEE YOU, YOU'RE FOOLING NOBODY.**  Just RTFM, save us all a lot of needless hassle. You, me, everyone. :yellow_heart:"
What can I do to fix this downwards drift ?:grimacing_face:,"hello im looking to buy a pare of goggles  for under 200 that i can use with most drones im new looking for advise Tighten the stick. Idk what radio u have but u can ajust it on most of em yeah it will, just update betaflight. Second hand Cobra X"
Hmm just with the screws visable?,You'll most likely have to open the radio up ah i thought that spi elrs is locked to 3.0.0
I mean you hold the throttle stick don't you?. it's not going to fall down,It should come tighther imo though
where is a good place to get a used goggles?,"rcgroups, facebook marketplace, craigslist, mercari, offerup"
"So, good news, drone works and it got up in the air. bad news is, one of the motors doesnt spin at the same speed as the others, on idle it was barely spinning then it stopped. after disarm i noticed all the motors were relatively cold apart from this one, any ideas?","Id go for 6S personally the power of it is amazing ELRS 3.x.y is compatible with 3.n.p. 3.* to 3.* should always work. This goes for SPI ELRS as well I can not really have my RX above the VTX, the elrs antenns is to long for that, so I do not really know were I can have the RX"
pictures of the motor and soldering. is a good start. gosh I don't get why you won't just shorten the tips of your wires. confusing. are all the motor mount screws the same length?. are you able to spin the prop separately from the motor if you hold the bell?,no. and yes all motor screws are same lengjt esc settings time I guess
"It seems that the motor is not the problem. it is the ESC. i switched the motors around and the issue still persists, what now?. new esc?. can i do something to the settings?",it's a decent cinewhoop with the Moonlight camera are the googles l worth it yes they're pretty good entry-level digital goggles should my LiPo cables be fine being bent to the side. i have a case i put them in but it isnt deep enough to let them chill upwards
as in like building vs buying a BnF?,"i got a really stupid question but i know like nothing about drones, what's the accuracy and speed that a relatively cheap(< 1k) codable drone can go to vs maybe a custom drone stupid question: whats a BnF Bind n Fly. basically power it on, connect it to your radio, fly it. everything is ready out of box oh. yeah. wait how common are just drones that you can code, like input a position and it can go there or is that just like not a thing yet you might have to look in to ardu for that it is a thing, though they can get fairly expensive i really know nothing about it https://holybro.com/collections/multicopter-kit. just an example, a bunch of those listings are quite old"
oh are these all codable?,most of them I imagine
oh great. yeah do you know how fast they are?,depends on weight and battery cell count but if i had to guess maybe like 60mph. as like a top speed :eyes:. thats pretty fast. at least for me
regular FPV drones can go much faster. what do you need the drone to be codable for?,"I need it to ""catch"" a very light object that might get pretty hard depending on the amount of accuracy you need"
"i got some [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBEuc4QwIv2I8n1YB5iyLwrFwH_pZ8yyX&si=0ANhhBbPshvvI2dE) of me flying my 6S 5"" if youre interested in seeing how fast a regular drone goes but thats completely unrelated","i think my distance will be < 10 feet, but the catching accuracy might be about 6 inches. however ill be constantly updating the ""landing zone"" of the object"
You fancy elaborating a bit on what exactly you're trying to accomplish?,"lmao yeah alr. me and my friend are working on just throwing a ball and the drone flying under it with a like bucket on top of it, and ""catching"" the object. our vision and prediction is basically done what to do if my fpv drone does the start up sound but then doesnt turn anything on What do you see in the goggles nothing. it was black"
Does your controller get a connection?,no. nothing gets powerd on at all just here the sound then it does like a dying sound afyer I don't suppose you could send a video of that
no they basically haven't been touched. why?,yeah it is and no they didnt they just stay black and statcy oh okay i just heard that there were some firmware updates that fixed the problems they might've improved
anyone have any experiance using Sn62/PB36/2AG? is it worth it over traditional solder?,"What damage does charging above 1c do It damages the batteries, decreasing longevity and increasing internal resistance. The faster you charge, the faster it happens. How fast they degrade also depends on how often you charge at that increased rate I probably asked this question but I can't find it. what's the difference between props pulling and props pushing no benefit for fpv just use 63/37 Exactly that, some props push the air down to move the drone up, some props pull the air to move the drone up. There is basically no reason to use pull props on fpv."
oh ok. is trhere any durability difference?,"Btw I might be mixing up the terms hold on. Sorry I’m wrong, pull props are the ones you want to use. Forgive me. Yeah always use pull props on an fpv. Can’t find a diagram. Push props have no real reason to use"
Outwards props won't throw particles into your camera when you crash. https://youtu.be/bZL-BBl9JnE?si=UhnaYxzt8oU4YbqF. Haven't watched it  but I trust bardwell,"isnt that an entirely different thing :person_shrugging: I've never heard of pulling and pushing so I assumed that's what they meant thats a pusher. > pullers are better for freestyle acrobatic flying, pusher are better for hovering or indoor yeah that's what i was talkingb about. reversing the motors"
anyone know what mosfet skystars use in their ko50 esc?,"problem also being I'm not sure which one is f specifically fucked. if mosfet isn't burnt is it fine Sometimes the damage isn't visible on the surface/is really really tiny (look very hard for a tiny crater on one of the mosfets) but it could also be one of the resistors that burned. Also I'm assuming the quad already flew before (so startup power wasn't an issue) and that you tried swapping 2 motors to be sure it was the esc's fault sort of. i think i shorted two connectors on the mosfet when doing motor wires. something exploded. it could have been the connection on the fet Probably not, swap the motors and check if the others are spinning nicely. And if we could have a (properly focused, with a background light, not a flash) picture of the faulty esc it could help"
whats the dif between a esc and aio. im planning on getting a 03 air unit which one is recoomended?,"a single esc can only power 1 motor. an aio usually has 4 escs in it plus a flight controller do you know a good one Also, aios aren't recommended for a 5"" and above (except for an ultralight). If it's a 3.5"" or under, then go with an aio im planning on building a 5 inch. which a 03 unit It's an ultra-light quad For example https://ummagawd.com/collections/2fiddy-5-frame/products/2fiddy-ultra-light-rtf is an ultralight one without a gp pro. cause im planning on using just the 03 unit That has nothing to do with it, an ultralight is a quad with much smaller motors, a lighter frame, smaller batteries etc than the standard for this size, like the one above weights around 170g iirc, a standard 5"" would weight like 450g do they get more battery life https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/dji-o3-compatible-frames-electronics-accessories/products/flywoo-explorer-lr-hd-o3-deadcat-long-range-4-frame-kit. im looking at this 4 inch Well that frame is very specifically made for long range, and long range only. Not remotely the same thing as a freestyle 5"" https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/dji-o3-compatible-frames-electronics-accessories/products/quadifier-diamondback-hd-o3-5-freestyle-frame-kit-choose-your-color. would this work"
"Work for what ? To fit motors, yeah, to be good, not necessarily, I would get something like a volador vx5 if you want a 5"" freestyle frame around that budget","ok. do you know a good esc. that would work with the volador The hobbywing xrotor 30x30 stack,  and I'm assuming it's for a freestyle 5"" since you gave me basically no information about your budget/intent etc budget around 380. im just tryna play with it outside With an o3 inside that's going to be hard should i stick with my avata A 5"" is only suitable for a fairly big field whats a good budget for one wiht a 03 @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) did this, motor spins fine on other terminal far left fet i believe is the offending one Would have been nice to be able to actually see the fets so around 650 with the battery and charger. not bad i took the cover off last night but never took a picture could prob get osme of it for christmas If you get a decent charger like the hota d6 pro it's going to be 650+batteries at work now but i will try get a picture You could also go with like a toolkitrc m6d and save 60 or so $ ok. when my replacement avata comes in tmrw imm try manual"
so 3.3.0 should work with 3.X.X?,"yes. 3.3.0 should work with 3.0.0 - 3.5.1 (latest version, if a newer version comes out, it should work with that too)"
Can you give some more context?. I don't have enough time rn to go digging through msgs,i need to read the elrs guide then because i cant bind them What's the difference between blue and green maybe look on the other screens. right side seems to be doing something still Well it started beeping when it turned blue like it was done. I'll have to see if it happens again as I already disconnected the batteries. The manual shows every color but blue :loudly_crying_face:. I'm gonna take the AIs word for it
"Anybody got an Idea how to adjust the internal voltage meter in the Avatar VRX? I can do it in the Orqa's I'm using, but did not find a way for the VRX.","It's with betaflight that you calibrate the voltage, the vtx is not responsible for the voltage readout I'm not talking about the VTX, I mean the VRX receiver I have to use for the Orqa's you can't. and it's quite obnoxious"
Is the Aos 3.5 v5 frame decent?,"*meeeeeeeee* **eeeeeee** *eeeeeee* eeeeeee *eeeeeeeee*. On the heavy side, but it's very clean from a tuning standpoint, and fairly tough. It is not possible to implement audio into the FPV stream, the system does not support it. The best you can do is record audio locally and integrate it in post-production. You could use a small USB audio recorder or pen recorder"
How much should the screws be screwed in? The sides are little curved,Tight enough that the camera isn't going to change angle while you're in flight. The carbon will straighten out when you put the top plate on
"Hey guys, what does rpm filter mean?",I can’t get it on really
Because of the camera plates?. Betaflight's RPM filter is a dynamic filter that tracks the motors' RPM and filters the gyro data based on the motor RPM,"Ahh, it wont let me arm and it says that. Will i have to change something in betaflight. Never seen it befotr"
"Is this a brand new build, or has it flown before and something changed?","Its flown before. Loads Loosen the camera screws enough to let you install the top plate, and then re-tighten them after install So when i tried to arm it yesterday, it wouldnt connect with my boxer, so today re flashed it to bind it, that might be why"
*What exactly* did you re-flash?,I re flashed the whole drone
I can change the direction of the camera but if I shake the drone it is still in the same position is that enough?,"Oh. Ok. So yea, *something* changed, for sure. Like the entire configuration. I assume you didn't save a backup. Should be good enough These are the settings that gg gave me My knowledge of your build is restricted to this conversation"
So what hardware are you working with?,Im using a mobula6 with a rm boxer
Which DSHOT speed do you have selected?,300. Srry i had a power cut
"Nomination for Understatement of the week, right here. :KEKw:. ""Maybe something changed""  ""Yeah, possibly.  I reflashed the drone without a backup (because the Rx wouldn't bind to the Tx, no less)."". Why is everyone's first action to reflash the firmware?  It won't undo the unchecked twiddling you didn't document, it'll just make it worse.","No because i think it was something i did yesterday. The one before was fine. So i flashed to the good one. That wasnt twiddled with I would ask why you're repeatedly flashing different firmware versions, but I'm not sure I should. Mainly because nobody really  gives me a straight forward answer :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Have you tried asking a straight question, after looking for the answer yourself?","I mean, we were trying to figure out why they are being prevented from arming. RPMFILTER error At this stage here, you should have been googling the error Betaflight gives you to determine the cause. But I'm also trying to work, so not doing troubleshooting right now"
"There's a gulf of difference between ""helping"", and ""holding your hand and vicariously doing the work for you while you learn nothing"".  Do not forget that every helper here is here of their own free, unpaid will, and is usually multitasking real life while doing so.  This is why good questions go unanswered, and lazy ones, doubly so.. Straight question; what is the drone? (Size, FC/ESC, Video system, voltage)",Yo guys my motor doesnt spin i buy a new one and it still doesnt spin maybe the esc to fc calble is brocken or something you really only needed to swap it with another motor on the quad lol i will tell you tomorrow because its in a other place and i cant get it now
Its a 5inch what do you mean with swapp the esc. ?,"just sayin you didn't need to buy a whole new motor to troubleshoot, coulda just borrowed a different motor from the quad. > oh or do you have a 4in1 esc Ahh. No just a normal esc"
do you have a multimeter?,But im at my moms hous
Anyone gotten a beta air 4in1 FC that has esc passthrough connectivity issues?  This one refused to ever read esc #4.  Funny enough it boot and flys fine etc. I just had to swap directions by soldering which was annoying but not a biggie.,buy one. does your esc look like this
"Also any fix for an esc with a fucked phase for precisely one motor?. 2 mosfets seem to be giving garbage readings, so either a short before them or they are done. reflow that solder","Harbor freight usually has uper cheap POS multimeter you can get for free with the monthly cupon. But you'll be  better off to spend 20-50$ and get a nicer one with proper continuity check mode. yea that soldering might be causing problems, if something's shorted"
just use 370⁰c. Also how are you testing your motor?. Are the others spinning?,"Yes. Betaflight speedybee or just arming Yeah redo the solder first see if that helps like @Scootzronnn try to make the solder joints like this, or better. you shouldn't have any bare wire exposed except for the tiny little bit of solder directly on the pad itself. i.e. if it looks like this, then you've got way too much wire exposed and are risking a short 370⁰C on a huge thermal sink by a newbee is asking for troubles, IMO. there's a big chance he'll try to heat it up for a long time and maby lift the pads I mean, 370 just tap boom tin the pads. That way it stops you from  keeping that sucker on there too long. boom in and out. same with the motor wire, hold it on top, melts the solder on the wire and the solder on the pad nice and evenly. in and out thats what i've asked.. if any of you know any electronics capable of recording audio without using some microcontroller... and use :sparkles: *flux* :sparkles:. i just obtained new ptsd material reading a reddit where someone just straight up didn't use flux i meant local recording and implementing it in editing and the other users were like ""yeah its optional and makes it easier, up to you"" :PepeKEKhands: a gopro. a microphone I made two suggestions."
"I'm designing a custom bracket for a GPS mount. Is there an ""ideal"" angle for it to be at? 20 degrees seems fine but I'm curious if there's any opinions on specific numbers.",So it's pointed straight at the sky when your craft is at it's usual flight attitude.  (Match the camera angle) what’re yalls thoughts on leaded vs leadless solder Leaded is easier to work with
do you use leaded too?,that's what you should use as hobbyist. the only reason professionals and companies don't use it is because you're not allowed to use it in those scenarios
ok cool! also you mean 0.8 mm dameter or what?,"yeah. 0.7-0.8mm is a really good size, you can do everything okay with it"
also how big of a deal is the iron i use?? I have a crappy iron from this kit but like... it works lol. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q2B4ZY9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1. shoudl i get somethign better for drones?,"It's a humongous deal. You won't be able to solder an ESC with an iron like that, it simply doesn't have the heat transfer. it'd be very messy"
damn. also is this an ok flux pen?. https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Harware-8310000186-Kester-Soldering/dp/B00YL1D3US/ref=sr_1_2?camp=1789&creative=9325&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IwRlGPlLQRSI_9k4RNXDLDF9uLeijcfia7va2jxMvRFq58UgswE4fSS0vs8rjXLrX-e_RC0xPv_GRSZf5HIAUzfEmNqGYKlN1QdF0pvxfo50bydrJDnO96oF1EH1QDBfVBPJDIPMRGdLJQEgKxudf-laiOvaYdPFBc0Zqs4eYs43kni-tcxlyXrEQ-2tl5Uptpc-TycWXmhGkKuqKOEHQ_g6hdiFTfg5kZoILu7e6Qup5r75lr9h99mKeo0imHWf66e1wL0iQ7euo2q5CqeG_L0-gbez8Kjmcnh16tyu0eY.rEWaBY-kfim7LvTK3O92CFDNUU4So5z_1_uG6p6R9WI&dib_tag=se&keywords=Kester+Flux+pen&linkCode=xm2&linkId=b346f049029b85d669d14f688cc1cf7e&qid=1729030649&sr=8-2,"probably. just make sure it's no-clean. chip-quick might be cheaper.

so you'd recomend TS tips? maybe i'll just get a bevel one?. do i really need more than a bevel tip and a cone tip?,not for drone stuff nk. no. TS-BC2 with the big flat tip is important. for soldering on the big ground planes on escs. makes it a lot easier
so do you think i'd be ok with just the tip that comes w/ the Pinecil and the TS_BC2?. https://www.amazon.com/Types-Stainless-Soldering-Replacement-TS-BC2/dp/B07HG4VRFR. this tip right?,yes but check the reviews. see if anyone has pictures of it coming in a miniware-branded tube I’m confused why there is so many different ELRS models.  I just got recommended the “RadioMaster Pocket ELRS 2.4” there are some... interesting reviews
ifixit has them for 16 including shipping i think. if you want to be sure. which options are you confused about?,"i think he's confused because some include batteries and some dont There’s quite a few listed which have ELRS if you don't have 18650 batteries already, get the one that says ELRS 18650 (whatever color you want)"
also yea wait are you from the US or not?,Okay ty. Im in the UK order from UK fpv stores then
Can you not change this later on?,it'll just be MSRP + tax
"Damn really?. Fairrr, then I guess it won’t get held at customs",Throttle is physically different since it doesn't automatically center
also get LBT one (i think?). FCC is the US standard. though i think FCC also has higher transmit power so do with that what you will,"ohhhh. So which is the most typical Mode 2 is the standard nowadays to the point other modes are barely sold anymore I’ll look out for that then haha. I’ve only ever flown cheaper “toy-grade” drones. But really want to get into it unmannedtech, hobbyrc and yourfpv are some uk stores i know off the top of my head. they're quite good"
"Can I run the full list past you quickly? I’m getting the remote, and potentially the goggles(to use in sim still) before winter, so I can practice on a sim, then I’ll buy the full kit in the spring when it’s actually flyable. I’d much rather be confident in the sim first, I will do a lot of research though (and learn how to land, not just reset each time). Awesome Ty",the unmanned tech one is overpriced it has tax added remember. but they do vary in price oh i mean ig. but like 65 pounds is kinda pricey. that's like 85 dollars i mean they have the clear one We got tinywhoops for when its winter :p it looks like the charcol one's out of stock in all the UK stores. or conformal coating lol
RadioMaster pocket/elrs 2.4 eachine ev800d crux35 elrs 2.4/analog B6 Neo (AC) 4s 850mah - 2 at first. Is that solid?. For like around £300 total. Ahh haha.

Gear is eternal, drones aren't. some gear is eternal. eachine ev800d sure isn't /hj some are some aren't lol The thought is that I get the ev800d, and if I upgrade, I can use it as a secondary display. For people with me. Sort of thing yes but. Cobra X for example have outputs for screens. and Walksnail Goggles L are cheapo digital. just as a comparison"
do you have a quick charge power brick?,https://pyrodrone.com/products/hota-t6-dc-300w-pd-90w-15a-1-6s-lipo-battery-charger
Just any USB-C tho?. I use an iPhone :loudly_crying_face: I have a 20w brick tho. That’s it,"might need to get a more powerful charging brick then Damn. For £25 the Hota looks solid tho. Ty for that recommendation. My worry is that it’ll get way too expensive, too quickly. At the price point, is the list still solid, with the hota instead everything basically maintains value"
wait since that one's a 300W charger would you need a 300W brick?. because i can't find a single one of those. or is it using some sort of stepup transistors or somethingg,"And then like the crux35 hd is at least another £60 It does all add up no, it only does 300W when connected to a proper DC source. there is no USB PD standard for 300W. it does up to 100W over USB PD. which is quite impressive Fair. Maybe I should buy an android for the included brick"
but if you wanna use the 300w you'd need a 300w wall>xt60 ?,Then I could use the phone as a monitor in my PC or smth :loudly_crying_face: yeah you'd need a larger DC PSU
"I need to quit the expensive hobbies, I’m into PCs and RC cars, now drones too fml :man_facepalming:. I’m doomed. Do you think if I go analog with the current list, I won’t enjoy it as much and it might ruin it compared to starting at Hd?","analog is fine. I still fly analog, it works well enough for me also do yall think i should wait for next-gen walksnail to drop or just go with the moonlight"
What do you think of my list then?,Thx man. Gonna ignore the HD people. Too expensive. Especially starting out

"Hello, does the DJI RC controller works for fpv game?","not sure how to tell when my LQ is low. it should through USB you tell them to read something, they come back saying they've read it and then go and ask a question that's answered in the thing they supposedly read. and then they defend themselves insisting they read it I tried, but it only recognized my xbox controller, not the RC. Ehh like 70% is where I'd start to get seriously concerned. Anything below 90 is like ""hmm, this is not great"". Lq tells you the percentage of packets that are actually getting to the drone. If you run 500Hz and LQ is 50, then the drone is effectively only getting 250Hz i got mine set to i think 7:100 and 250hz. i cant seem to set an alarm but which number should i focus on lowering Basic rules of thumb:  Low RSSI, high LQ: Signal is weak but very readable (not much noise)  Low RSSI, reducing LQ: the signal is approaching limits of readability against noise and might tank suddenly   High RSSI, low LQ: interference. Will failsafe if it gets bad enough.. Wdym focus on lowering like which should i be worried about lowering '. like how you mentioned 90% Left is the mode (packet rate), right is the LQ. Mode:LQ Both, neither tells the whole story alone.. Read this @Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST) I don't think really anyone will reasonably know how the BetaFPV software works, the Aquila is basically a scam because of it. Your settings in DRL also have nothing to do with the other ""screenshot"" you sent. would it be possible to get this OSD element to show up in DVR but not while flying. or is there an app like walksnail osd tool that can overlay it I just flew around with it a lil bit before it gets dark why the actual fuck is it so fucking loud"
Blackbox can somehow be used for this but I've never done it. What are you flying and are you sure that you didn't put the props on upside down?,It's brand new so it's correct
Props were preinstalled?. Did you check if they were preinstalled correctly?,"Ah, these can't be f*d up.

"How do I setup/connect a servo to a quad FC? I need to be able to use it to activate a mechanism by flicking a switch on the radio. Would it just be m5, 5v and G?. Then setup m5 as a servo output in betaflight?",I got a brand new zorro today the lcd screen has streaks on it like on the rows and columns where the text or pixels appear
Hii fpv friends i think i losed my capacitor?:thinking_face:can i fly without? And which one do i need to get on my nazgul5 v3 5° 6s,well as far as i know capacitors r very important to keep the voltage stable from the battery. or this gonna happen
uhh not sure ill check. how did urs fall off?. could u send a better pic. of ur fc and esc. @Arre605,That's a buzzer. And it should be possible to just solder back
Where are those settings in edgetx?,"Go into the System menu, on the Radio Setup screen, and you will find Contrast and Brightness settings yeah same. you can play with the contrast until it looks fine"
"guys im currently using the xing2 motors on my 5"". how do i know when i need to change them?",that worked pretty well ty you change them when they stop working right
"Hi all!  Getting back into the hobby and updating my iFlight F405 TWING, but I'm getting: ""Failed to open serial port"" and ""Initializing reboot to bootloader"". Any ideas on how to fix this?  Thanks!","assuming you're on Windows, use ImpulseRC Driver Fixer :slightly_smiling_face: Okay :slightly_smiling_face: thx for the fast response To explain the issue:  When the FC reboots into DFU (firmware update mode), Betaflight Configurator can't see it because Windows picks the wrong drivers for it. The right drivers are included in Windows (afaik), but need to be manually changed. yay! its working. thx again! are there builds that dont require soldering, im in college dorm and am not aloud to in it, i could get access to a place to solder if i get special persmission(wich is low) Get a Pinecil and just do it outside when it isn't raining. You can run a Pinecil off a LiPo :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: oh it ran serial. let me check now"
"How would they know if you did?. When I lived in dorms we smoked weed in the room and never got caught, a little soldering wont get you introuble unless you are the RA and you snitch on yourself",Thats true yeah they wouldnt know unless ra check room I definitely wasn't supposed to have girls in my room either
New build or old build?,new. a tinywhoop. motor 3 isnt spinning correctly Are you trying to flash the escs with esc-configurator.com
Is it giving an error and not finding one of the escs?,the write button is grey. it doesnt have a hit box Send a screenshot. Yeah you need to read settings first
Have you done this before?,how do you guys power your drone arduino or. am i cooked If you havent flashed escs before you should watch a video or read an article about how to do it
when i flash them i read it in esc config and itll begood?,:hundred_points: cooked. No one sane builds an FPV drone with an arduino unless you're a college student looking to self-flagellate for 18 months
dis good? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEDhnBUFQNI,"And reference this link for what settings to use after flashing so you don't burn an esc https://github.com/bird-sanctuary/bluejay/wiki/Setup :loudly_crying_face:. then what bro. im trynna make like a slightly autonomous drone. like as long as it has pretty accurate movements, nothing too fast Look at the Ardupilot project, look at the list of compatible flight controllers, and then start googling furiously"
"Is it vcc —> 5V, GND —> GND, VID —> Cam?",if your camera takes 5V then yes Hey folks. I hope cross posting is okay. I am having some issues with my Vision40 and could use some help if you have some time. Here is my original post (help-with-drones): https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1296149380314697841
Should I remove the VSEN wire? It is the only one that is not going to be used because OSD and the other GND is used to the other thing that I did get with the camera,yeah you don't need it. don't cut it off. take the wire out of the connector
Show the ports tab and the receiver tab. ExpressLRS?,idk XD im just getting in to the hobby aginen my drone was build mby 4 ore 5 years ago is it an sbus receiver
aaa okej. shuld i reflash the drone with somting ore is it just the setting?. i get telmetry losst when i dissconect the battary.  so i tink its connected,oo im sry. how can i chek that
Is it**?**  :yellow_heart:. If only we had some sort of symbol to denote such a thing... :winking_face:,but that takes 3 whole button presses on my broken screenn
brb i need to eat. how can i check my receiver? can i do it with the pc?,you check it physically. look at what it is How can i check if my walksnail 1s vtx is dead. No leds. All wires are connected
This one. Ok. So hmmm. It must be getting power cause itll get hot. Right?,I mean see if it connects and stuff I guess. well yeah but that could also be a very bad thing Well my wiring is all good
Is this the vtx ore rx?,the thing on top is the VTX
Isnt there suposed to be a resistor here?,"Well im fucked. Unless i somehow manage to find it I guess this could be it. It comes from 2 antennas. goes to a sp, a gnd and a +5v this pad. ore mby on closer inspetion nt2 Hey folks! I just joined in because as a beginner, I'm a bit lost on what to do here: I’ve got the flight controller (FC) as shown in the picture, and also a camera (also as shown). The video input (VidIn) and output (VidOut) from the cam somehow need to connect to the FC so I can get the OSD, but I’m not sure if I’m using the right ports (VTX and T1). The image is flickering a lot, but interestingly I can see part of the OSD. Not sure what to do next. Edit: if i connect the vidIn and vidOut together, I do get a proper image so its not the cam thats making problems"
what FC is it. Did you use auto scan on your goggles?,"iFlight SucceX F4  twing im building my own goggles..with screen, raspberry pi n stuff... and 3d printer why would your goggles need a whole computer Found this image online. I did not figure out a better way. But anyways, first the img has to be proper hehe oh okay, that's sbus then. naww :loudly_crying_face:\ Dont judge, but i took one from old darwin vtx and now it works lmao. It works though It's a filtering capacitor U know how small that shit is Fair play to you for making that work though. They're tweezers jobs they are. Its as thick as my nail @Ettan5 You probably need to set serial RX to UART2 (i think), and on the receiver tab set the protocol to sbus (i hope) Idk for how long though lol In my defence. My soldering iron was $6. On aliexpress why do you hate yourself Its amazing. For the price no it isn't, like 10-20 dollars more and you can get a clone sequrew what is the antenna box thingy that goes on the back of your radio Well, atleast my vtx works again lol it adds a transmitter (or theoretically anything) to your radio ok. also what antennas woud be better on the ev800d# not much. you can only do so much for the ev800d"
to update it agien. i hade som problems. :grinning_face_with_sweat:. like this?,okay. still got noting I feel so good for finding the problem and fixing it with a broken old vtx part lol
it says that the vtx is configured or not supported. shuld i just roll back to the old vertion?,its analog. but having problems with radio not working ether
"Guys, My goggles x are not pairing to my ws mini vtx after pressing bind on both   What should I do?","update both, and follow the manual"
Does the vtx need to be powered on during the upgrade or does it draw enough from the USB?,needs to be powered on I mean you only showed me one
Any suggestions on how i can solder this better. ?,if it reaches into ohms it's fucked no matter what. milli ohms
whats a good/healthy range?,below 20 is usually fine it has 4 wires but only 3 concted. the guy that built it dinent conect it and it worekt with it disconected i tink. The wire isent even striped you want to wait till the end. these values are basically only good once you've finished charging. but that just looks like a new battery. lol yeah its only had like 6 cycles maybe. wish the charger could keep track of cycles
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet)  whould it help with a old backup?,Thanks :see-no-evil_monkey:
"no problem, need help setting up the OSD or anything?",if you could post that here Yes please. You can just point me in the direction of a guide or a video that's cool too
and this was working?,"go to OSD in betaflight and set it to HD then drag all your elements a long time ago but yes i guss make sure the VTX is set to displayport i havet done anyting but just back up it sorry, I honestly thought FPort was just the telemetry and didn't have SBUS in it already. so you probably need to set it back to FPort on the receiver tab the ports tab *was* wrong though and is now correct. so once you set it back to FPort try again Haven't configured Betaflight yet will get there in a few mins once I assemble this make sure to set up your ELRS receiver in BF too, mine is on UART2 in that photo"
Can do it after assembly too right?  Hopefully the bind button isnt in a weird place,"yeah you can, pretty sure the ELRS receiver doesnt have a bind button its the radio that connects to it. id set up a bind phrase to get your radio consistently connecting to it but idk how to do that ``` set serialrx_halfduplex = ON save ```. try that in the CLI"
for a bigger camera?. oh the dampeners. where's the second one,use different spacers i... i wonder if betaflight needs to be specifically flashed with fport flashing it now. :face_with_tongue:
Guys how do I flip the camera orientation digitally in WS mini HD 1s VTX This is possible right?,Yes. In goggles. When connected to the vtx. There is a camera section im getting signal! but its spining. so not the right channel maping yippee. it should just be on the right in the receiver tab. you can just change the channel mapping
Does it support 90 deg flips as well?,"why is your camera sideways in the first place after waiting 2 weeks for my aliexpress shipment of a couple vtx's i finally soldered on a replacement and its currently giving me the same exact problems, so i think its the flight controller thats the problem It would be a little comfortable to mount that way I think so yeah. Not 100% sure though"
for the vtx what protocol shuld it be?,uuuh. i keep forgetting this is all old
can you guess the uart?,```vtxtable bands 5 vtxtable channels 8 vtxtable band 1 BOSCAM_A A 5865 5845 5825 5805 5785 5765 5745 5725 vtxtable band 2 BOSCAM_B B 5733 5752 5771 5790 5809 5828 5847 5866 vtxtable band 3 BOSCAM_E E 5705 5685 5665 5645 5885 5905 5925 5945 vtxtable band 4 FATSHARK F 5740 5760 5780 5800 5820 5840 5860 5880 vtxtable band 5 RACEBAND R 5658 5695 5732 5769 5806 5843 5880 5917 vtxtable powerlevels 3 vtxtable powervalues 25 200 400 vtxtable powerlabels 25 200 500 save ```. no you're just going to have to look again okay :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: nope. there are no best
so what do you recommend?,"its gong in to a plug on the back side of the fc. tink its u1 I recommend you grab a set of every single one you can find. and try them all out, and find what you like. uart 1 then! yes :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
?. why would you want to switch out of a (presumably) good tune midflight,"will higher Kv motors get me more flight time got 1960Kv rn and can get like 4 minutes regular flying and 6 or 7 lightly that's already pretty high. I can get like 9 mins with a ~760g build on 2207 1950kv and 1300mAh 6s. I'd look to optimize in other areas i got 2207 1960Kv 1200mah 6s. not sure about weight but its barebones just a source one v5 with everything on it Biblade props are worth a shot for your flight time increasing goals. pretty positive its [these](https://pyrodrone.com/products/gemfan-hurricane-mck-edition-v2-51466-durable-tri-blade-5-prop-2cw-2ccw). pyrodrone refuses to let me see previous orders 3.6"" pitch. I had 3.5"" on mine, shouldn't be a big difference if i can get more flight time from different props then im all for it it isnt tuned at all :stare: idk where to begin tbh try throwing the Supafly preset on there is it possible to set it to a profile on BF https://supaflyfpv.com/betaflight-setup/ and use the calculator here to adjust the sliders so i can switch to it mid flight or something with my radio idk torque or speed drawbacks :person_shrugging:. ill see how it flies. i got 51433. not 51466 the tune only affects how the PID loop reaches its setpoint just found out i could have gotten purple props :PepeCopium:. purple and orange would look so nice alright, new flight controller, new vtx, still not responding to the channels im setting. the vtx table is correct, betaflight says the channel and band i set is saved, the vtx on-board toggle says a different band/channel, and my goggles show a completely different band/goggle from the three. maybe this vtx is dud from the factory... Dji is quoting me 70 for a damper replacement the part is 10 dollars is it hard to repair i mean. did warn you :loudly_crying_face:. @serfma (NOT hurricane chasing) you are like the only person i know who has taken these stupid things apart alright, replaced the VTX with the 2nd spare i bought, works as intended, so the 1st new VTX was bunk on arrival. thank you for watching my repair journal like and subscribe ding bells sounds like the geprc experience... Oh what model was it. what model mini 3. unless that's not what you're asking oh never touched a mini 3. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i think i just removed the earpads from my sennheisers the wrong way. oh no lmfao. i did Anyone req other whoop vtx options not betafpv. Are rush tiny tanks still enjoyed rush and tbs ones. happymodel should be good too last time I checked Wrekd had some TBS VTX in stock"
could be a desync?. I'm not too sure,seems to only happen when going heavy on throttle and the voltage dips try to maybe up the demag compensation in ESC-configurator i got no clue how to use this. i think its connected fine yes connect. and then press read in the bottom right. make sure you have a battery in oh. i thought i was connected you could be. but that doesn't mean you've read the settings
just set it to high?. and no wonder i was having issues getting this in the air,all of this look good or should i change something else
you can maybe lower the rampup power a bit. but probably don't need to. there's a cap on it right?,:PepeShrug:. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i press write settings when im done right. we ball. i got the pacman theme as a startup sound now. sadly no tetris theme search one online. someone has definitely made one ok so. i noticed when booting. the back left motor seems weaker almost. like it doesnt move as much for the startup sound what about when you arm it all motors seem the same. the top right does the same of barely moving on boot for the chime. it might just be random idk i mean these tunes are. per-channel. like you have 4 motors that sometimes produce different sounds. to have more depth in the song :stare:. no wonder it made me accept all 4 chimes. i just pasted one in to the default and accepted it. holy shit it sounds so much better. nice
I think scouring AliExpress for any old LED would be a good idea. are you fully deaf?,anyone know any bright strobe lights to put on my drone if i ever lose it i cant hear the buzzers due to being deaf i cant hear high pitched sounds because these beepers get very loud i cant even hear fire alarms. too high pitched high frequency bilateral hearing loss. thats what ive got. also profoundly deaf
do you have a newer samsung or iphone?,ive seen some drone long time ago with very bright lights. ive got the new one i think. s24 ultra. unless they bought new one out. OH GOOD IDEA the newer samsung tags have UWB inside of it
I know what you gonna do. sound app?,"oh. thought you was gonna tell me to download a sound app and try locate a sound I don't know the range of it, but if you roughly know the area of your drone you can connect to the tag and your phone will quite literally point you to it through AR i aint lost my drone yet just making sure i dont lose it. found a bando but its got kinda long grass there yeah it could still go through that yup. if you have a bigger drone that could fit on fine ive got a nazgul 5 inch well thats good to know ive already lost my keys maybe i should get one for my keys too lmao I would genuinely give that a try before messing with LEDs ive done plently of soldering before rn my nazgul bottom lights and side lights strobe but i dont think they are bright enough. The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag is a tracking device that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to locate items within a range of about 120 meters. oh thats good. im gonna try a sound tracking app first. controlled get someone to hide my drone in a field and see if i canf ind it with the app i don't think that'll work very well pretty quiet where i fly. literally noone there. middle of nowhere pretty much https://www.amazon.com/VIFLY-Platinum-Anti-Collision-Compliant-Multiple/dp/B0D542R7VX got oner of those already. so bright lmao. got vifly one though UWB is cool as heck tbh"
does all the samsung trackers use them?. i just dont know if it would look weird on my drone it looks pretty big,"it's small enough. i think theres some prints for it rn. looks like that goes where i put the gps. dont think it will do any good being so close to the gps though my SO has a few since she's also partially deaf and has some other issues that make her lose things quickly. these are really useful for her, she just kinds of press a button and it points straight to it i think im gonna stick my vifly to the drone for now. until i can get one of these trackers. THEY ARE TINY @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) maybe he got big hands I mean they are little keychain thingies. but it'd easily fit on a 5"". and you could probably manage it on a 3.5"" they are 2 inches. i think. ‎5.2L x 2.9W x 0.8Th centimetres. 5cm. tiny. my drone also has gps if that helps but i dont think it do. ok thats cool yeah i genuinely think it would work for you. and when it's too far away it'll gently guide you using the BLE until it can use UWB people seem to actually use these. i just wonder where they attach it I didn't expect that honestly everyopne saying the apple ones are bad they use bluetooth or something idk. oh here we go. that might fit where the gopro mount normally goes i dont use the gopro as i mainly use the 03 unit could go in the back too battery strap one. thats also good. idk if it would mess with gps. i like the battery one. could defo just print this myself than buying it for $10 lmao probably only when you're actually using the locating. which uh... fair"
do you know about 3d printers? do i 100% need direct drive to 3d print tpu,I've had my battery slip out of its plastic shell and fly away gonna end up doing it anyways. bruh. ive never crashed yet
do you have a dryer?. what printer do you have?,ender 3 pro. super old lmao you can upgrade it to direct drive though just make sure you dry it before attempting
what do you mean by dry?,i mean i wouldn't spend a dime on it ive had this printer for like i think 4-5 years now i'd just get a bambu or prusa mini (bambu goes on sale often for like half price) you can print the part to make it direct drive. printer evolving itself
"so i was flying my tinywhoop but the last pack i was going to fly have said no and after i gave power it looked like the vtx reset, the osd went gone and i couldnt arm anymore. ive tried another pack and it was the same. today ive wanted to see if there was hope. it flew so i went outdoors and this time after giving power the everything looked like before but video signal looked like it was lost but it was with colors. after 3 tries it flew normally. should i just fly it how it is or is it something major?","Whatever you do do not get a prusa mini. Bambu is so much better at this point Not compared to a bambu Bambu A1 mini vs prusa mini, bambu prob wins. Way cheaper too. And supports multicolor easily I’ve had only mediocre experiences with my mini yes but. you have described those issues. and most of them seemed like a you-thing. and no one was comparing them ffs True true. Wait how the fuck have you remembered that. Godsmn. Fire memory plug in a battery put on the goggles and smack the whoop on the desk a couple times see if anything weird happens. -> quick loose wire test :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: i hope that thats a joke you want to cause an impact that's not as strong as a full on crash, but still enough to jostle stuff around. bad connections are often really difficult to find intentionally the camera and battery isn't aio idk how your VTX/RX are. few aios have both on board i have a diamond f4 do i have everything on it. *almost ah yeah that one. well, it still has wires. and honestly, loose components have happened before :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. I had a VTX which would change frequency due to vibrations/crashes smacking it is a good idea and has had me fix wiring on multiple occasions. better when its in front of you and not in a tree you're going to crash it worse than that anyway, so better crash check it before that happens :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
u scared?. you don't have to smack it like it owes you money just give it some purposeful taps,"i dont see why not, i wouldnt fly too far away though if your vtx is trying to see its self out. tinywhoops are p.sturdy until you hurl them into something at 20-30mph, those solder joints aren't load bearing i flew 2 packs, crashed like 3 times and nothing bad happened so i dont need to worry for now i guess"
Can I get long cruising by just putting 4s Li-ion instead of 6s Lipo on 3.5” with 2850kv motors?,"You could indeed put an 18650 4s pack on a 3.5"", tho at the end of the pack you will probably end up at like 80% throttle to stay in the air"
"Because of a low voltage like 12, which is not enough to spin the 2850kv fast?","||It's 12v not 12|| And it will still spin *""fast*"" just since it's half the voltage and say your hover point on 6s at 3.8v is like 40%, then at 3v/cell on a 4s it will be at 80%"
will a too loud startup sound really break my motors?,Just unboxed my jumper t15 how do i play with it on the sim
are you sure that all the connectors match up? Sounds like there's a lot of signal loss,"Hello fpv friends! How can i get my range better i have installed this 4 antennas at my google and one at my drone , the vtx makes 1.6w of power. But i reach only about 500m"
Hello everyone I want to replace the motors for the Baby Ape pro v2 with some better ones. Maybe someone has already done this? Which ones are better to choose?,"Wonder if this is going to affect my flight performance much :slightly_smiling_face:. Be sure the mounting pattern of the motor screws match up with the frame. you can't. unless you get a different frame As long as it isn't very long, it shouldn't, but it isn't impossible. That's why it is not recommended to leave motor beacon active for a long time."
also whats motor beacon?,"To add to what NielsB and Vitroid have said, the Baby Ape frame and motors use a non-standard mounting pattern. So you cannot just drop in new motors from off the shelf."
okay. isnt it going to float upside down?,"Yeah it's not for landing on water, it's to not have it sink to the bottom of a lake so I can recover and salvage what didn't get destroyed by the water you can always coat it, place the foam on the top and you dont even need to go get it hehe Or move the floats under the motors so that they behave more like pontoons such a long antenna stalk isn't that good for vibrations. also the angle is way too steep and should match your camera, so the antenna always points straight up on the goggles the right omni is useless because it's shielded by the big on in front. with that big one you'll also have to look straight at the quad because of the tiny angle the radiation pattern gives you. there's a good chance you'll actually looking at the ground assuming the polarity of quad and goggle antennas match, there's no actual explanation for the short range tho. even omnis at 25mW should work for that kind of range yeah just rearm and fly out from the bottom of the lake I wanna get that a set of stubbies and good xair patch antennas will give more range… but I also don’t know too much about antennas"
"even without any antennas on the goggles you should have good signal with 1.6W output. so there's something very wrong with most likely the quad/VTX (pit mode, etc?). throwing antennas at it won't fix that","oh, i guess i meant @Arre605  the X-air are very good tho"
Ok thank you ! I had also on my vtx 5646mhz. And on my goggles 5645mhz. Make this a big diffrent?. Yet i have it 5880 and 5880,"Proof that all the best antennas in the world cannot make up for a bad receiver. Well it certainly seems like something isn't correct, because you're saying the VTX (5646) and goggles (5645) are on different frequencies, but *those* frequencies are different from what you have configured (5732).. 5880 is not in this equation at all Yes the first numbers was only a n example"
"well it says ""device ready: no"", so maby the smart audio isn't set up (or you're powering only on usb) where is the VTX table from tho? cause the values (Wert) doesn't seem like it's supposed to be. usually it's lower numbers like 1,2,3 or 10, 20, ...",And yes i set it after the ss to 5880. Ohh i did nothing in here all original Maybe go through the process of setting your hardware up correctly first
original of what? is that a bind-and-fly quad?,Mines heavyyyyyy. 31.6g. No battery
Symmetrical OSD....? What?,I have no idea what you're talking about like. the grid. symetrical osd grid I still don't understand
"wait.... some osd elements aint symetrical. crosshair, artificial horizon, etc. is there a way to make them symetrical in bf or is there something else that makes it in the center?. thats what ive meant. they dont fit in the grid correctly","No. The grid is 30x16 cells in PAL mode, 30x13 in NTSC, and 53x20 in HD. Some elements are even length, some are odd. The analog OSD is based on the grid supported by the MAX7456 OSD chip, which overlays a pre-loaded character set on a hard-wired grid"
so the only way to make artificial horizon perfectly in the middle is to use hd?. oh okay. so i cant,Yes but even then it will be one cell above or below center.. At least it would be centered horizontally yeah i prefer it to be centered horizontaly Well you can only use the HD OSD with a digital system. So if you're flying analog you're SOL on this
https://tenor.com/view/disappear-gif-24972837. how much watts does the whoopstor v3 need?. because when i plug it to a 60w charger it says that i need a psu that supports fast charging. i dont want to use packs to charge other packs :loudly_crying_face:. i need them for other drones not for charging tinywhoop batteries,"Just a USB-C charger is not enough, it needs to be a USB-C PD or QC rated"
qc stands for quick charge..?. im confused. min input power for the whoopstor is 6v and min input power is 40w. why cant i use 10v 65w to power it then?. it needs pd3.0. maybe somethings wrong with the whoopstor?. idk how to check if the psu has this,"They're almost always marked in some way. PD ports normally have a little lightning bold next to them. Or it will literally say USB-C PD. Or QC. Sometimes you need to check if your cable is rated as well, IIRC"
also what’re ppls thoughts on Walksnail goggles L vs X? I don’t really think i need the goggles X since i don’t really need any of the features but im worried im gonna outgrow the goggles L,get whichever the best is you can reasonably afford is genuinely just it like it seems like goggles L and a cheap pair of analogs would be cheaper than goggles X and an analog receiver (for when i wanna get a tiny whoop and not spend 250$ for a walksnail one). i mean do we think that (if walksnail ever releases it) that L would be compatible with next gen walksnail cameras and you can build a walksnail tinywhoop for 160-170. I assume so i mean ig that’s comparabale-ish to an analog tinywhoop BNF
i’m assuming goggles L also don’t hold their value quite as well?,especially if you find second hand deals on vtx
I wouldn't expect them to hold value as well but I don't expect them to disappear in value?. unless they just release something better for cheaper,"i’m just thinking about worst case scenario (i get goggles L and then outgrow it and wanna upgrade to goggles x). it seems like i could just sell L and there wouldn’t be a huge difference hopefully. i’m gonna go see how much they’re going for used brb wait how dumb is it to get a used fatshark dominator. since it’s have swappable antennas very. it is basically not supported anymore You can swap the antennas on the gL, you just need to open it up but there are easily accessible ufl plugs on the internal VRX I remember talking about it to someone and they said its a lot harder. like I said you said that, and they said its a lot more then that it is. it isn't ""just"" opening it up. lol then we should prob make that clear"
i mean is the receiver and antennas on the goggles L like bad or is it ok?. i’m not gonna be going like long range or anything,its great. someone just said the record. let me check what it is. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/888419476909981747/1296523851810996275
wait is that unmodded though?. because that seems crazy stock. like i’m just trying to understand what would make me wanna change from the antennas on the goggles L (other than using other video systems ofc). since realistically if i’m gonna use analog i might just cobra x or eachines,would it be possible to set up a switch or something to cut off power to the VTX. want to maximize battery life and reduce heat if i ever lose my drone yes. but imo i would do the opposite of that to minimize battery life how would the drone dying help what if it rains. unless you have good conformal. you want it dead asap well im hoping to use whatever beeper onboard to get it sooner or later i could have it as a toggle switch. idk if its the cable or the finder but i havent gotten it beeping at all. battery doesnt even seem to charge on it show maybe. i am sus about your soldering the buzzer connection on the FC is a plug. i am not going to be blamed for this :PepeBoomer: A sadly large number of vifly finders I've gotten are just dead. Parastitic draw kills the cell. did you check if they match at least replacing their battery is very easy i have a cable with both plugs i need but it had 2 extra wires in it. removed both of the extras. and it charged fine once. but i havent gotten it working ever since. last it was working is when i was still working on building the drone If there was a good  cheap source for that exact or smaller cell for cheap I'd def do it. Never bothered to shop for them tho. hoping they release a better one at some point. really could avoid all that stuff Kind of hoping to get the finder working without the battery or just getting a different buzzer. Unless it's completely fried
can you check the voltage on the battery?,Perchance. Give me a few minutes Yeah if they just didn't commit suicide soo often it would be great. So. Where exactly are the pads I'm testing on this thing the. positive and negative. of the battery 0.026v maybe. Its hard to do with this plastic wrap stuff. I'm just gonna remove it and let heat shrink fix it later
I'm trying to update the firmware on my ELRS receiver and I can't find the manufacturer in the dropdown menu in ExpressLRS configurator. Anyone ever run into this? I have a JHEMCU RX24T 2.4GHz Micro Receiver and can't seem to find it anywhere in the program,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) well the actual battery positive and negative are wrapped up but reading the pads that lead to the board I get like 0.2v Jhemcu isn't officially supported and is a brand you should avoid as a whole. they didn't pass tests and all that
I am asking because last time I was flying the JHEMCU receiver kept bugging out and dropping telemetry. (it made me worry and think there might be a firmware update that would fix) Should I just rip it out and replace it with my spare speedybee receiver instead of spending any more time with this one?,"yeah most likely. It's a lot of effort to get an update file for that thing most likely. and I doubt that the receiver is working properly. no elrs receiver really should do things that bad under normal usage on any recent version thanks for the advice! going to make the swap in that case I would just stick with big elrs names. or. ""popular"". Bayckrc, happymodel, radiomaster, betafpv. sequre. anything approved"
anyone know any good Betaflight rates preset for freestyle?,It really depends dude. I personally use 850 850 700 on my mob 8. Actually it might be 800 800 700
i thought it was still compatible with the moonlight and new stuff??,yeah. but if anythings gonna go. that'll be first
Is there any Sim that does LoS?,"pretty sure a few do. liftoff does i think. it's kinda hard to do line of sight in a sim though since there's no real depth of view Tyvm. Was looking at a few but havn't seen one mention LoS. Will have a closer look at Liftoff!  Ah ok, but i guess it cant hurt tho :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. Theres not so many days left i can fly outside."
Hello fpv friendss:) how can i set roll and pitch an 1500? My jumper t pro is already calibratet,Thats just the shitness of the radio. I have the same issue with my t pro
Can we do nothing in betaflight? calibrate ??,"Velocidrone does it too.. (and is a much more realistic sim, from a physics and flight dynamics standpoint)"
Yo guys my reviever randomly poweret down it only has a low   Voltage light on someone help me?,"You can put the best antennas in the world on the EV800D and only see a marginal improvement, tbh"
"Any analog goggles that are not too expensive? (max 150-200€) Or is it better to get a digital system? Don't really want to spend alot of money just getting started, but also dont want to need to replace everything because of bad experience","You can make a good chunk of money back if you sell the EV800D on the used market. If you want to stick to analog, the Skyzone Cobra X V2/V4 is *light years* better. But if you want new antennas, the TrueRC Singularity and TrueRC X-air are a good choice for a decent price @𝔻𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕪"
Would they be enough for flying through buildings or should I just save up more money for the Skyzone Cobra X?,"[The AOS Cine35](https://www.getfpv.com/multi-rotor-frames/3-quad-frames/aos-rc-fpv-frame-kit-cine25-evo-cine35-evo.html) is a good choice IMO. Looks like the Speedybee Bee35 also supports the O3, just browsing really quickly. I have no way of guaranteeing that with any antennas on any receiver simply because I do not know what your local environment looks like. If you're flying through bandos or buildings, you're in RF hell anyway. But I can say that the Skyzone's receiver is a *lot* better than the EV800D"
So you would say it is worth the extra 140€ for the cobras?,I personally think so
Alrighty cobras it is. Thank you for the help. Any upgrades on the Crux35 you would suggest getting? (If you know/have experience with it),"Not really, it's a pretty decent build"
Can I just buy another set of radiomaster 18650s for the goggles? And what other brands of batteries would you recommend?  I know brands for rc cars (1:8 buggies and such) but I don't know which ones are good value for drones.,"You're going to need some sort of battery for the goggles. Tattu R-lines are great, but expensive compared to other batteries that are probably better value, generally speaking IIRC the 18650 for the Cobra has to be flat-top, and it looks like the Radiomaster ones are button-top. As for good lipo brands, check out GNB and CNHL Okay, will look into other 18650s and lipo batteries will come back for more questions if that's ok"
"Criss-cross, like scrolling lines?",idk mby. it looks like x es on the screen.
Interesting. Probably a combination of factors.. Can you send a pic of the wiring and list of hardware you're using?,yes give me one min. a mateksys VTX-HV. and a lumenier ax2 as the antenna iflight succex f4 twing
Should i charge this at 4.4v or 3.8v?. What does the hv mean,https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/
"Do you have the VTX connected via connector, or soldered to pads?",soldered. i tink. but to the fc its connector Flat top for the pocket!! Honestly why can't they stick to one thing
why cant i use switche sin the sim?,"does anyone know how to use a skyzone 020 on pc, i have a mini hdmi cable, but when i have the headset powered on and connected i dont get hdmi video"
Depends on the prop.. Did you set up the goggles as a secondary or mirrored display on the PC?,i do not know how to do that
Did you set up switches on the radio and can you see them on the HID inputs on the computer?,"I can't teach basic PC usage i think i can figure it out, just didnt know i had to do that 2150kv is fairly low for 6s 3.5"", let alone 4s These motors are rated for 6s I think 2650kv is more appropriate I basically want to build a geprc cinelog35 with 4s instead of 6s. But idk which motors to get 3450Kv is a lot more reasonable for a 4S 3.5"" imo"
Any recommendations?. Because I can’t find 4s motors that fit on the geprc cinelog35 frame,"High voltage would i say ..i would read on the backside if its writen if you can charge it to 4.35v Those motors you linked have a 3450Kv option. Use that. how can i check this on jumper t15. how do i configure the switches on the radio Yea i just didnt want it to blow up lol, ill try charging it up to 4v and see how that works out All the answers you seek are in the lipo guide that was conveniently linked for you do i need beta flight to configure radio switches I was asking in help quick questions. Just a simple yes you can charge it to 4.35 was all i needed But there's so much more to it. Just because the question is quick, doesn't mean the correct answer is Eh ill just play it safe and keep it at 3.8v then"
what is prearm?. also whats pit mode and VTX power,"God the steadyview gets really fucking hot i can't touch it at all. Pit mode, Lowers your Video Transmitter (VTX) power to something lower than you can use to configure your quad. a mode that has to be active before you can use the regular arm mode. would recommend setting that up"
mmk. joshua to the rescue. wait is beta flight for the drone or can it be used for the radio?,"It is, the steadyview is an amazing module but I can't stand in the sun without touching the top of the goggles without getting first degree burn marks, I'm printing a ventilated cover with a spot for a fan to fix this tbh most goggles have had problems like that. and over time they all fixed it with a fan. just cobra x probably didn't because budget cost. lol Yeah, So i took matters into my own hands. I'm gonna hook it up to the same internal fan connector. So i can have control how do you get beta flight. well whoich option do i choose Just read starting from the top. you got this it's for the drone. your radio doesn't fly"
mmk. so i configure switches etc on the radio?,"Pro Tip: Reading, particularly manuals for things, will make your whole life easier. It will certainly make this hobby less hard work.  Avoiding reading anything more than ten words will lead you from mistake to problem, problem to disaster, and on to nowhere good.  No-one spent the time writing all the documentation for these things because it was fun. It was to ensure people could learn to use these things. Don't be **that guy (or girl)**, just read the manual. yes i finally found the manual online which has helped as i have finished reading the entire thing"
"i used some 1s lipo batteries on my whoop recently and left them for a few days at about 3.4 v. Now they aren't showing up on my charger, but the one that was left a full did. Anybody know why this is happening/how to fix it? The holes are too small to get a multimeter pin into","You killed it. You left a battery fully empty, and that just kills it."
damn it. i just got these lol. is there no way to fix it?. even if it is a bit risky?,i mean you can try charging them but they'll be way damaged my charger yells at me when i try that :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:
What voltage are they?. You can plug it into a connector with exposed pads at the end,it says 0.3 but theres no way thats right. the full one is reading 4.1. which is right
"Is it okay to do that? Tank solo does not fit in place of VTX, but it seems it can fit over ESC (hasn't arrived yet, can't check). I'll put the screws in the VTX through the ESC, and put the FC in place of the VTX.",i mean. i wouldn't doubt it. like seriously well i tried the nimh trick i found on youtube and it seems to work. so i'm just going to hope it doesn't explode on me lol
"You can't rotate the VTx to get it in the back?  If not, what's in your picture *will* work, it's just not **ideal**. :thumbs_up:","I can, but then the SMA pigtail and connector would look ugly on the sides"
i want a new drone but not at the moment any suggestions? (i have an emax ez pilot rn). i dont want it to be $300+,"what controller and goggles do you have. please have them not be emax It's probably a better idea to upgrade that first then. if your experience with goggles and transmitter get better, your drone will suddenly feel a lot more fun what ones i dont want to spend alot of money The FC (more specifically, the gyro and accelerometer) will do their job better located nearer the centre of rotation of the craft. It will work at the back, but I can't comment personally on how it will affect the performance of the sensors. :why2:. is your transmitter expresslrs at least find out\. it's important by looking at what you bought"
i got it for christmas. how much time should i spend in a sim vs actually flying?,"Pass as much time on the sim until you have the quad (go on the sim for at least a couple dozen hours), then there isn't really an optimal sim/irl ratio, just fly your quad until it burns"
k. is fpv.skydive good enough to practice?,"(i use my xbox controller to fly cus my controller can't connect to pc) maybe buy a radiomaster pocket No, but it's pretty cheap how cheap we talkin :PepeBigHmm: Base license is 15 bucks, and each dlc (which are absolutely worth it, it gives you access to more quads and maps) are 5 bucks Go check their website, and you definitely should get a pocket if you are on a budget because emax crap, is crap"
will the radio master pocket work with my drone?,"Just taking a glance at the EZ Pilot page, I'm going to guess ""no"" (this is why we don't recommend RTF kits) (that's why we don't recommend emax in general) their motors are decent I hear Their eco II motors are decent, but I would get the T-motor velox or xing2 over them their motors are only decent because they're a dollar cheaper than all the rest. tbh"
can you post a screen?,Video clip + picture of stack/aio is needed. can't do any diagnosing without that It's a bit challenging to get a video feed in the goggles. I'll try again tomorrow.
nope how do i record a dvr?,what goggles do you have eachine vr007... soo relly old
can you solder better than what's on there now?,because it wouldn't be a bad idea to at least get a better joint on the battery leads. and replace the capacitor. you can also try keeping signal wires away from the esc and power wires in general. so like your video wires from the camera and to the vtx should be kept as far away as possible from esc and stuff
aaa okay. How do I know what capacitor I should use?,for 6s the standard is 35V 1000uF Interesting topic. I found a few threads on reddit. Mostly they say it has no effect probably okay to use the same Cool. Crack on then. Let us know how it goes :thumbs_up:
installed OSD on two seperate air units. one displays perfect. the other no osd at all.  is there something i need to do in betaflight ?,yes. <https://oscarliang.com/fpv-wtf-dji-goggles-osd/#Betaflight-Configuration> these are the only ones im seeing in the drop down menu. maybe the cli commands will bring it back
what version of betaflight?,you're going to need to update that to latest. do `diff all` in the CLI and then press `save to file` in the bottom right damn.. last time i did that it bricked my drone so i went back to get it working again just do this lol. we'll get it working
before i do anything will this be of any use?. just wanted to make sure before i start,yeah but only after updating ok cool give me about 10 minutes ill ping ya back when i do first step
are the sky zone 04L goggles any good?,they’re looking to sell it all in a bundle with some upgrades to the rest of my gear for 300 but  i might try and convince them to do it for less. it’s just a thought atm probably won’t do it but who knows
what current gear do you have?,"rip off goggles and a tx12. and my mobula 8’s fc has a broken ceramic antenna. not looking too hot. :pensive_face: they're fine goggles. the tx16s is kind of huge and not that comfortable. and those drones look old and might be frsky. which is kind of sucky the mobula looks like a 2024. idk about the emax though. i think it’s a tiny hawk 2. which is frsky I don't know honestly. I think if I had 300 USD to spend like that. I would sell my existing gear and assume I'd make maybe a 100 bucks from that. then get a used Cobra X and maybe a RadioMaster Boxer or whatever. and then have spare money for a tinywhoop. like an Air65 mmmh okay. i probably would keep my tx12. it’s practically new. i’ll think about it. thanks. i was thinking to just get a new fc why not just. get a piece of enameled wire. try repairing the antenna i probably could try but i have no soldering experience practice boards. they'll teach you enough do you know any videos that teach the basics off the top of ur head no but there are really only 3 rules. zero exposed wire, pre-tin most pads AND apply heat to the pad and the solder to the pad too and NOT directly to the iron. and get good gear"

Does this look burned to you guys or am I just seeing things? Also what is this,yes. that component should be a tvs diode
Quality control. Where did you get it?,"how do i wire the camera and video transmitter. for the camera do i use the cable that comes with the camera or the speedybee one I bought it from GETFPV and it's a Iflight Nazgul Evoque F5D O3 ELRS Return it. say it came defective, it literally looks like someone soldered to it too. and then order from a site that has better customer support, and get the ECO instead of the Evoque"
"I'll email them, unfortunately I got the quad back in August so we'll see how it goes. Is the Eco better than the Evoque?","It's the same quad but way cheaper. only differences are different stack and different motors Ah, thank you for the help, this is really dissapointing hey if they don't accept the return. you can just replace the esc. 30-50 USD"

Kinda hurts. But I guess it's good I learn this stuff being new",yeah don't get that one. get a better one and a cheaper one What would you recommend anything that runs on AM32/blheli_s/bluejay. maybe one from skystars. <https://pyrodrone.com/products/skystars-am60-am-32-60a-32bit-3-6s-4-in-1-esc-30x30mm> <https://pyrodrone.com/products/skystars-ko50a-3-6s-blheli_s-dshot600-4-in-1-30-5x30-5-esc>
Would it cause any issues with the flight controller? or are all FCs and ESCs interchangable?,"yes they are. BUT. the plug might not be, but you can easily repin the plug (or just solder it) and it's good. !repin https://youtu.be/fh9gvhobVro also the current esc pads are on the corner, most others arent motor cables will most likely not be long enough. blitz mini E55**S**  runs on blheli_s/bluejay same as the ones you linked (btw evoque uses 20x20mm mounting) why does the T go into the R well. transmit goes to receive. and receive goes to transmit. transmitting to another transmitter wouldn't have much of a point"
did you coil up the motor wires under those mesh tubes on the arms?,Phoenix RC flight sim
Okay so i found pictures of the orighinal one and yes the white cable is in the middle. So I connect the white wire here?,"Alright, just had to make sure. thanks alot! Be quick with the iron when working around LiPos. Heat, they do not like. A middleground, want decent flippy floppys and more then 3.5min of flight time Ofc its not a freestyle quad. Well. Here comes the issue I only permit myself to build it bcs i have a 2s aio laying aroumd Gonna have to make it as light as possible then. Barely there toothpick frame of some kind Lightest possible motors. https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ez4voiH Hmmmmmmm. Bcs those are on the bassline so they widely available. Im making it with the avatar 1s though. So that adds weight I mean, I have 1404 4600kV on my 4s 2.5"" ""Cinewhoop"" (it's anything but).. So 11k kV might be a bit much for 2.5"" Im wondering if i should go 2 inch Not gonna save much weight on a smaller frame, losing half an inch of prop, but you'll notice the difference in thrust."
Ah ok. So how much kv do you think would work best for me?,"Now then..... Lemme think Im doing exacly the same. but gonna build a mob 8 with it Haha. Ah thafs fun too but i already have a 75mm nicee. yea i flew my friends air 75, so fun to fly 11000 isn't *too* mental for 2"" to be fair. i love that you can turtle anywhere Pushing it, for sure. Ive got no grass where im at haha"
So 9000 would be better?,"Would be less power hungry, definitely. But between 9000 and 11000 is where I'd be looking, I reckon."
"On a 2"" prop that is. 2.5 would want to be a *little* slower.. Bit heavy and big for an 85mm I would say?  I'm no expert at those sizes though. I do bigger stuff than that as a rule.","Yes. 11kkv for a 2"" 2s is the sweet spot imo I like more pokey motors too, but fella did specify flight time as a concern :winking_face: haha fair. alright nice. i got the right kv then :face_with_tears_of_joy:"
2.5inch 9000kv?. Or lower?,"If you want to go with a 2.5"" 2s, some 1103 8000kv motors will work great on some low ish pitch props like the 2512 or 2520, just keep the whole build relatively light, no need to go for a toothpick to have it perform well with them, but don't build a chonker either. Yeah I know, you can easily get 3min of freestyle with them, I get like 3min40 by flying freestyle in my backyard and if I really push it I get about 3min. On my 2"" 2s (with some 450mah 2s, so you could even go with a bigger battery). I would go a bit lower for 2s, or go to 3s ~6000kv if you want more power"
well... do you have any use for a legacy cinewhoop?,"Alr thanks alot!. I wil probablymake my 75mm analog again and make a 2.5inch walksnail ripper yeah it's mainly just old. modern cinewoops perform a lot better Bcs my 75mm is 32grams now and i only get like 3.2min of flighttime. So id rather go analog with that i think pretty much everything alright, i won’t get it then thanks :partying_face: 3.2m of flight time isn't that bad, I usually get like 2.5min on my (analog) 75mm, with 0802 25kkv motors (granted the T-motor motors I use aren't the most efficient) the huge thick ducts don't do anything unless they're specifically made to be ducts They do do stuff, they add weight and drag if it's just a cylinder spaced out pretty wide around a prop it does nothing but create drag"
is there any benefit to charging below 1c?,"Yeah, it is a chonk, a good analog 75mm should be 20-25g, and with hd, you can still get it to like 25-27g without that much hassle What am i doing wrong. Mob 7 motors. 1-2 betafpv aio. Air 75 frame and canopy. And the 1s board from walksnail The aio mainly, you should also swap the props or at least try other ones like the ultralight 40mmx2 and gemfan 1610 could definitely save a g or two by swapping to lighter ones I have mob 7 biblades the big red rubber grommets could also go And those props are stupidly high pitched for some 0802. Absolutely I dont have any to replace em with It will be way more responsive Okay. Wait. I have some smaller gromlets Lemme rebuild this sucker And going with a lighter aio like the f4 5a 1s light (without motor plugs, so no need to remove them) will also save you 2 grams"
How much less durable does it get from removing the heatshield on the avatar?. Im probs not buying a different aio though,"Not much, and it saves 1.2g, it will just heat up faster on the bench but once in the air it doesn't change much"
"Okay so, different props, (maybe antenna mod), vtx heatshield and gromlets?","If you use one of the sleeved dipoles with a thick coax, there is a good gram to save here I mean this kind of linear antenna. With the top removed basically. Dont mind the mob 7 aio. Just talking abt the antenna Yeah so just making it about a monopole, I'm talking about if you have one that looks like that with the thick coax you can still save a lot of weight by just making it shorter too Nah i have the standard walksnail 1. But i could modify the stock walksnail antenna Well then you don't really need to make it into a shorter monopole Just removing the second element will already save most of the weight of the antenna It's what you are going to make Ohh. Aha. Yeah ill do that The standard antenna is a dipole, cause 2 poles, the wire sticking out and the sleeved element around it, a monopole only has one, here it will just be the part that usually sticks out Lemme weigh it before and after and ill tell you how much i save with all my mods. Ah ok thanks for explaining the tinwhoop.com guys did a nice quick process of it in a video, I can find it real quick You will probabily save like 3.5g-4g Its just heating op the metal parts while pulling the monopole *the solder joint, not the metal parts"
https://youtu.be/If-KoYJcMFg?t=538,"Yeah. Yeah, thanks!. Ok brb in an hour. :KEKw:"
"And besides what we already said, the only other things you can do is actually swapping the components to save weight since you have a heavy aio and motors, and using reny screws, but that costs a lot more money. Btw, do you use motor plugs or did you remove them on your motors ?","(also you could chop down the frame a little, but that will remove some durability) I might be crazy but do LiPos charge faster towards the end. it takes like 20 minutes to go from 3.80v per cell to 4v and 10 minutes to go from 4v to 4.20v Well, the voltage curve of a battery isn't linear (here it shows for a li-ion, but it's the same thing for a lipo) yeah i thought it would be slower too. ill have to see when i eventually charge my batteries yo how do i test the mah of my batts Yeah but I forgot about the little bump at the very end i flew some 850mah on pavo20 pro and got like 5 mins only. :skull: that seems about right thats a good flight time You go fly them until they are empty (3.5v), then charge them back and watch how many mAh the charger says it put in the 550 flies for 6 mins. as advertised flights are usually 2-7 minutes i use 850. shouldnt i get more flight time Welcome to fpv, that's normal You also put extra weight depends on how they tested them 850 is a lot more heavier for the 850 bat. i charged and discharged at 1c. did i get scammed. only 10grams more i did the from 3.5v to 4.2v at 1c and got 700 mah. for my 850 mah"
Are they the connar or (something like that) cells ?,"is that normal. yeah. coddar Well, that might explain part of it ngl they cheap asf tho so idrm. wym The same thing as when you said you bought some coddar cells. It's not because one guy said 4 years ago that they were fine that you should get them is the 850 from 3v to 4.2. maybe thats the case. do i try discharge the bat from 3v to 4.2 and see if i get That would be fairly dumb Since we don't fly down to 3v"
so it shud go to 4.35?. Oh.... i think ik the issue. its high voltage,"If it's hv, you should just charge it to 4.35v"
i charged to 4.2. so im supposed to go to 4.35?,i watched a yt vid. and they said hv packs other than 1s shud be charged to 4.2. forgot the reason well... they don't need to be charged to 4.35. but you can't expect to get the full capacity range when you don't do so will 4.2 to 4.35 give alot of extra cap
and will lipo break faster?,"it's more likely to be killed in flight than by being charged to a higher voltage will its lifespan decrease tho HV cells are specifically rated to not explode at 4.35V Especially if it is rated for this higher voltage the lifespan decreases with every charge cycle one way or another will it be significantly worse if i do charge it to 4.35 Undercharging will increase the lifespan, but then you won't get the rated capacity if you do can i overcharge normal lipo to 4.35. i wanna squeeze the extra capacity out If you want it to crap out after a dozen cycles. Or actually go kaboom. Non hv lipos *can* be overcharged, but that doesn't mean you should. A lot of lipo fires are because people over charged they batteries i see. what diff in composition makes it hv. or is it just for advertisement we're not LiPo chemical engineers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Go email your favorite battery brand or go study solid state chemistry if you want a course on how batteries work, but basically *they are made to more better-er standards and can take more abuse* okok thx. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U494dFsOhtE the last line is important > if you want to charging them to a lower voltage is fine, but in cases like this it can lead to lower flight time. So you probably don't want to he said that when charged to hv on batteries other than 1s it dies in 20 cycles. is it rlly that serious. no way this hobby is that expensive. right... watching/reading comprehension is very important. > a **few years ago** when high-voltage batteries came on the market. that was the situation multiple years before the video. and the video is already 2 years old make of that what you will..."
@RobertoSalami are you flying 1S?,I think 4.20v should be fine. I've been able to get like 6 minute flights with 6s. Only batteries I ever charged to 4.35v were 1S batteries and I got around 4 or 5 minutes do charging to 4.35 give extra time I'll see in about an hour maybe alr. lemme know how it works out Theoretically it should but if it isn't a big improvement I'd say it isn't worth it hopefully at least a 10% increase the flight time to battery breaking ratio isnt worth it imo. you loose a lot of charge cycles when charging to hv What does #P mean on batteries. Like 3S1P yo is it possible to charge 18650 for my radio pocket with my hota charger @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) i shaved off almost 4 grams. Its amazing how much of a difference it makes. I can do flips now. And i get like 40sec more flight time. Like 4min and 20/30 sec. Thanks mate
Should i put a hit shrink on it?,"yeah, or your phone charger wrap the cut wire with electrical tape oh never knew it worked that way, thx electrical tape gets so nasty after a while put heat shrink on electrical tape :Harold:. uhh the sim recognizes my joystick then i press on `run phoenix` and nothing happens No worries, even if honestly it's probably more because of the props being way way too heavy and high pitched for the motor I mean without you i wouldve not changed the props or taken heat shield off. I did just break my frame though. But it still flies well. So idc. Ill order one when i need other shizzle"
anyone suggest any solder practice pads? or do any work,"I would get the one from diatone/mutefpv, it's really nice with every type of pads you will encounter in fpv, but realistically any will work well enough"

isnt flying los with a fpv drone a thing that people dont need to learn..?. like. i knew how to fly los without learning,Got a RadioMaster RP1 and after a little crash it won't connect to my radio.

Can I brush on conformal on a already complete drone?,DarwinFPV has a very spotty build quality/reliability record. Their ability to wire up a drone incorrectly and still ship it out is quite astonishing at times
how... do you plan on doing that?. I can't imagine how that could work,With a paint brush there's about an inch gap between the esc and fc
hm sure. but how the hell do you have an inch gap?,"Because spacers, one of the shields on the esc still almost hits fair enough I suppose What other drones do you recommend around that price range I don't do recommendations unfortunately, I just do support.

whats the drone?. also do you want to buy a fpv drone or a camera drone?. for a good camera drone youll need way more. whats also not enough for a new fpv drone. for 25$ youre forced to buy a toy grade drone or fix the drone you have right now,hello. i havea very cheap qualtiy drone. and it stopped working. so i wanna buy a new one. i live in india and branded drones are too expensive. the budget is preferbaly under 2k indian rupees i dont really need something professional. normal. drone

lipo?. how am i supposed to use the xt30 on the o3,"pardon. what. how. the o3 has like 5 pins You had to solder the connector to the fc. Or someone did. Just resolder the power wires to an xt30. Plug in your battery that is between 2s and 6s. And voila. O3 on a battery erm. is there like a xt30 to o3. wire or smt No. If a minor rewire like this is too complicated then I'm afraid I have some bad news for you about fpv as a hobby. I think you can do it though mi pretty sure its worse now i dont got a soldering iron Well that's going to be step 1 then. We really need to write a soldering kit faq huh. i bought a bnf. so didnt think of buying the first pack was the worst Soldering is an absolutely essential skill in rc and fpv. Situations like this are exactly why ive needed to connect it like 10 times becauase the drone just resetted every single time i gave power to it and sometimes the video went black, sometimes the video changed into a every color you could imagine, sometimes with osd sometimes no. and it resetted mid air. second pack wasnt so bad tho. ive needed to reconnect it like 3-5 times and then it flew noramlly. third needed to be reconnected lie twice. i dont think thats the solder job on the camera but im gonna resolder it anyways Pinecil V2. Job done. i cant find those in asia. and shipping is like 60$ if i buy from original website nevermind. its only 30$. its more than the price of the pencil itself you can also get it on amazon. maybe shipping is cheaper"
"hi, quick question.. so i live in an apartment and dont really have anywhere well ventilated where i could solder, so ive seen some videos of people diy-ing some fume extractors with a 3d printed mount and filters and stuff.. doesnt seem too difficult. but id like to power it via usb-c.. but im not sure how many volts a pc fan needs or how exactly i would use [these](<https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005296942890.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.5b6er7M9r7M93z&algo_pvid=2b13abeb-1f2d-4019-b6a0-84f9e6ceedac&algo_exp_id=2b13abeb-1f2d-4019-b6a0-84f9e6ceedac-0&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%215.08%215.08%21%21%215.38%215.38%21%402103892f17294449171397386e41bb%2112000032533622413%21sea%21AT%214138699090%21X&curPageLogUid=NUjqCZFMwSf6&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A>)  if anyone has built anything like this (or knows how to use the usb-c trigger board) i would appreciate some help","ah yes you can get it on the storefronts that aren't available where you are You could try not shipping via courier, the more expensive of the two options.

does a pc fan need like a ground connection or sth?,then just get any usbc pd brick that can do 12v+ and your good. yes everything needs a ground. its the black wire
"like theres usually multiple wires, right?",just solder it to the - pad the other 2 wires are pwm and tach. both arent needed for this. or just get a dc only fan i already have some spare fans at home. theyre like some corsair ones that came with my case just normal ones. i think these https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/case-fans/co-9050161-ww/sp120-elite-120mm-performance-pwm-fan-co-9050161-ww keep in mind when being fed 12v without a pdm they will run at 3000rpm
soo i just cut the connector off?,yeah. then just use this as a guide for what wires are important
oh and i dont really need speed control.. sooo yeah. and the boards i linked earlier are fine.. right?,"i mean if theres better ones i might aswell use them but to me they all look the same lol yeah they are all the same thing alrighty, thanks for the help!"

?. pls help idk what to do,You've sent so many messages I can't even find your original problem just read this and the 5 messages under it
can i send you a recording if i recorded it in liftoff?. i think the game only lets u view it and cant export it but im not sure,it just resets a random part of the aio when i give power to it. its happening since i built the drone. and also it doesnt happen every time. sometimes it flies and then resets. yeah. im pretty sure that somethings wrong with the aio or betaflight

no i thought that was fine. is there something wrong with what i did there?. let me find a good timestamp example,"no, I'm just asking clarifying questions. banked turns are fine oh okay no I thought that was as it should be. i think like 0:26-0:30 u can see after the sharp turn i have a ton of momentum. was i meant to do the turn like that. cuz it leaves me going to the right a ton and i have to compensate to be able to make the next post it looks fine, if not just a little too wide. you can try turning sooner and generally trying to put thrust against the direction you want to go"
so then like is it normal that after a sharp turn where you bank you have to just bank harder in the other direction to compensate?. hmm okay. wait how is putting thrust against the direction. how does that work,"if you don't want to go right, add more roll to the left and throttle to keep going. you can also just try using a bit more yaw sounds good thank you. also this is my first few hours of actually using sim/flying, do u have any other general tips for me For a few hours you fly great one other thing i notice is on really sharp turns (like a 360 or something) i get a awkward spot where I kinda float in the air for a second after a sharp turn before i throttle again and i was wondering if thats normal. thanks man, i have a lot of controller exp so i think it helps a bit I struggle with that too, I flew freestyle for 5+ years and only recently got into racing where this stuff pops up regularly. there should be some guides on youtube okay cool ill look at those. greatly appreciate all the help :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: I'm just getting into racing, and I still have this problem myself.

What motors / props are you using ? And is your battery full ?. And do you need to be at 50% for a hover (not moving around) or to fly around without taking altitude ?,"hey guys Im having some trouble with my FPV drone, which weighs around six hundred thirty grams. Ive noticed that I need about fifty percent throttle just to keep it in the air and id like to reduce it to around twenty-five or thirty percent.  When I attempt tricks like free falls, rolls, and flips, I struggle to keep the drone stable after the maneuver, which often leads to crashes.  If anyone has tips on how to improve stability or reduce throttle requirements, I’d really appreciate your help xing 2306 1755kv ethix p3  and yes i always fly with a full battery. yes. i fell like i need more power in the low throttle Try higher pitched props, the p3 are fairly low pitched, get some hqprops 5x4.3x3 v2s or some gf51433. That's not an answer. You could also add some negative expo to the throttle as an immediate fix. But I think the main issue is the low pitched props oh sorry i though you asked me that i i need to be around 40-50% to hover Well I would get new props and see if the issue persists i orderd couple of days ago the ethix s3, p.3.3 , and p3.5. maybe now i will get the p4 one. to try everything So you basically only got low pitched props. And there are other props than just the s*n* and p*n* series my motor is buzzing kinda. what can i do i know but i really like ethix... Most of ethix's stuff is actual crap tho only their props and mouse pads are decent and my drone is also like shaking kinda their props be decent because they didn't get them off of the cheapest aliexpress listing Well, they made HQ do them so they better be at least decent i also got the s5 and j37. tried them tbf a bunch of other Ethix stuff is pretty decent i cant really cause its usally when im flying but i could recoard some vids tmr through the googles honestly everything i ever had from them broke within weeks. or came rusted they were ok i didnt felt much difference yup. and that was when I was very limited on money so it sucked real bad hm. I know a bunch of people really like the chesty rig I would really recommend you get the two props I mentioned before, especially the v2s, cause it produces quite a bit of thrust so it should help if you feel like the other props you got don't have enough thrust I really like how the Stout motors look, but they don't perform exceptionally well that does look pretty decently made to be fair so what do i do if my motor is like buzzing"
it would be possible to get an analog [bassline](https://wrekd.com/products/happymodel-bnf-bassline-2s-analog-2-micro-quad-elrs-2-4ghz-spi?keyword=bassline) and put a walksnail lite kit in it. the walksnail version of the bassline uses the 1S kit and i have the 1S lite kit which should only change the camera and antenna but i want to be sure,wooper i think. it'd be more cost effective to diy. at that point
it looks like those motors include screws? do you def need different ones?,yeah current ones are 8mm long and i had some landing feet printed that require an extra 2mm of length to mount. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5922226. nevermind its an extra 1.5mm but hopefully 2mm works
i mean do you know the base thickness of the motor? because i couldnt find that (i'm also pretty new to this and maybe there's a way to do it w/o knowing that. but like i feel like you should be able to just add the 1.5mm + thickness of arms + base thickness and just get a screw that's about that length,the 8mm screws it came with screw in fine so i should just need 9.5mm/10mm screws yea that makes sense to me!
when did it start doing this?,I have no clue why its doing that I just noticed this today because everytime I tried using the drone it would either not arm or it would arm be powered for a bit then stop and start beeping. I think there's hair or something in the motor which is making jt not work right and I think that's all the reason why it's doing crazy flips
I am looking to get into fpv and I  was wondering what the difference was between the versions of this drone since the walksnail and the lite for 03  differ so much in price   https://m.banggood.com/Happymodel-Mobula8-Digital-HD-2S-85mm-Whoop-FPV-Racing-Drone-ELRS-BNF-with-DJI-O3-Air-Unit-or-HDZero-or-Walksnial-Digital-System-p-1989303.html?utm_campaign=5635792_1001216&utm_content=1081&p=CG24181822629201506N&cur_warehouse=CN&ID=6322260,The lite version comes with no VTX. It's made for you to install your own O3 air unit Ohhhhh. that makes sense. thank you so much :)
My battery was sitting on a screw head while flying and it torn off the outer shell. Minor dents. Should i throw it out or is it still safe?,"It's still fine, it has barely anything"
can i just send you a dm? im pretty sure it will be faster this way,As long as you don't smell anything sweet it should be good
that walksnail is digital? let me find a video for you,"Attached you will find two images. One is the absolute best experience analog you can get and is not at all representative of typical performance (which will include image artifacts, banding, black flickers, all as you get varying levels of signal). The second is an example Walksnail when you start to reach the edge of its range, when the image starts to degrade."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0yyZdkM7aI&ab_channel=Kirek_fpv. @Gunged watch this,"Walsnail does looks really good. Just not sure if I'll regret going down that path when I start to build more drones. this first build is a tiny whoop so this is the biggest decision for me going forward I think! it is a bit more expensive, but I doubt you will regret it. I am currently waiting on my third walksnail drone (a 1s whoop)"
"well I was more thinking of the large amount of people that want a setup for under 400. you can't really do that with walksnail, but its doable with analog. what is your budget like?","With Walksnail now costing what it does, investing in analog now as a newbie would be pure folly. well analog is still cheaper. but walksnail is a very bang for your buck system well. ev800d and a half decent analog setup. is a lot cheaper then a 1s kit and a GL. of course the GL should be compared to like the cobra X. that costs more Well yeah, the ev800d is only barely passable and is pennies. but if you have the budget for walksnail. its a very good idea I still stand by my original statement. As a newbie, analog is a terrible value proposition compared to Walksnail. yeah. its very much worth it That's the *real* difference though, you're right, the Goggles L should really be compared to the Cobra if you want to be more apples-to-apples. Comparing it to the EV800D is disingenuous with the GX it was iffy, but with the GL its just amazing Analog is dead, but for the few edge cases that most users won't ever get near. Yeah, did some more searching and defo seems Walksnail is the route to go down Yea that's tricky. But we are generally pretty careful to enforce that even at that budget level, the EV800D are barely passable like 500-600 initially, already have a boxer so that's for goggles/drone"
You game for building your drone?,"for 600 you can even get the GX with a whoop On liftoff atm, wasn't sure if velocidrone is better though Yeah, im looking to build myself I think its agreed upon velocidrone is the best physics Step one, get Pinecil and other soldering accoutrements and practice soldering technique. Like you're doing with flying technique in the sim. :yellow_heart: oh yeah he needs that equipment. so GL it is I have house rabbits so actually have lots of experience soldering"
"oh, do you already have a solder and everything?","I have an ok iron, but will get new solder for this build but have the sponge and stuff. mid-range solder iron* You will need a **good** iron for this, lest you burn expensive components. perhaps he means like a mid range station. then its prob fine In that case, ill probably need a new one"
What exactly are we talking about here? no need to be cryptic :yellow_heart:,"btw cool coupon code. you can get the GX and a whoop vtx for 440 you should put that in #fpv-deals. thats really good. nvm. someone already did or a GL with the vtx for 230 I can't find the link but it doesn't even have a station which seems like a red flag yeah people here got some things already. nah, a station is for weirdos"
"Pine64.com  Get a Pinecil and whatever else you need from there to run it. The iron itself is cheap AF and one of the best available atm.. ~~Oh, hold up~~. Get a pinecil. Oh, you're UK too? @Gunged",I am! probably should have mentioned that...
"Dammit.. One day.. One day someone will reply ""Sheffield, why?""","Still, get a Pinecil. Get it from pine64.com, get standard shipping.  Do that before owt else, sometimes delivery takes a couple of weeks.. Once you've got that in hand, we'll have a look and see what yourfpv, unmanned tech, and hobbyrc have in stock.. If you get a copy of Velocidrone sorted at some point, hit me up and we can at least have a virtual fly together :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:"
"Cool, what is the difference like in GL and GX?. would I regret not getting the GX? *","eh, ok lets list the things the GX has the GL does not. lenses instead of one screen HDMI in and out AV (if you want to fly analog) replaceable antennas live feed app  more futureproof seems like quite a few things. and they look way cooler sure but the difference in price is insane. like the GL. cost only 20 dollars more then the moonlight VTX. I am currently thinking if I want to use the discount and get another moonlight or another goggle"
the live feed app seems cool are there ways of doing similar with the  GL?,"no. listen il be honest. I have the GX I am very happy with it. and you can get the GX with a whoop VTX for less then I paid just for the goggles ahh, tempting.... also not sure what whoop build to actually go for now, was looking mostly at anlogue stuff previously you can get a 1s whoop either 65mm or 75mm. you will be able to fly inside and outside depending on your choice. great way to start"
I'm assuming these are the best uk suppliers?,I have a part list for a whoop if you want oh that would be good! Took me a second to put this together

why would you put the nano kit on anything?. ohhh for like 3s?,Am a professional 3d artist with some years of experience It has on-board storage yeah for like bigger drones I guess the lite kit does too I had a whoop in mind for beginners Yea I mean I could make a spreadsheet showing every possible combination for every drone for every pilot. But. I don't have that kind of time. So yeah np. yeah il be honest I am checking their statistics. I don't see a reason to go nano over the mini I guess I need a spec sheet comparing all of the walksnail kits now. That'll be my afternoon https://walksnail.wiki/en/hardware I'll be honest I was expecting it to be smaller and I don't know why there's a lotta walksnail stuffs already I am going on my tablet to be able to read this somewhat normally Fuckin bookmarked. Thanks almost everything you'd need to know about walksnail generally is on that site. doesn't mean it's easy to find though
"hello , i have  GEP F722-45A AIO V2 The firmware update stopped in the middle and now Betaflight doesn't recognize it. What's the solution guys? Did you lose it?","you should be able to put it into bootloader mode manually by holding down the boot button while connecting the USB cable, then flashing it without the reboot sequence"
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight from this link?,"downlod manually. 4.5. or 4.3 where did you read ""download manually"" that's because there's nothing to load. you need to enter the necessary settings before you can get the firmware loaded"
"I have a school project where we are supposed to build a drone. We have to use PLA, with a 3D-printed plastic frame. We're not allowed to use a carbon frame, which is a bit strange. So I’m thinking of using standard FPV parts, but without the goggles. With a controller, of course. The tricky part is that the drone has to be able to get programmed through a PC, for example a script runned in betafligt? We need to receive video fram the camera and telemetry data on the PC through Betaflight, or in some way.  Hope some proffesionals can come with some adivice on how to execute getting video feed on a pc, getting live data from the FC onto the pc (i suppose data from gyro etc) and how to push scripts onto the drone making it do very easy tasks from a programmed script",using PLA for a frame. is downright dangerous and a SERIOUS hazard
"@DædalusFPV what about live data and camera feed showing on pc, any tips?","Mavlink will take care of the telemetry telemetry data. For video feed, you'll need a separate screen with an input, and you'll need to convert whatever FPV system you use to it. Or you can use an HDMI capture card, and display its stream on your pc. If you use a Walksnail VRX and a Walksnail VTX kit on the drone, the VRX has a straight hdmi output. I actually do have some experience with the last bit on my walksnail ground station"
"Any thoughts on why Mission Planner won't spin one of my motors?  I tried with two flight controllers (Mateksys H743):      with two ESCs:            with 2+ different motors on each esc  Initially, the first FC didnt spin ""motor A"" in position 1 I tried swapping the motor with a spare, still nothing.  Then, I swapped the ESC, with a whole new set of motors as well (FC to other drone). ""Motor A"" on the other drone (again position 1) didnt spin. I assumed the issue was then with the flight controller  So, I swapped the flight controller, installed firmware. All motors spun fine on the other drone, good. Then I moved it back to the original drone. This time ""Motor B"" (still position 1, same physical motor) didn't spin. So I tried swapping the motor, tried 3 in total, tried resoldering.. nothing.   Finally, I repeat the test and put the FC back on the other drone. Now, once again, ""Motor B"" (again in position 1) wasn't spinning, even on the other drone.  So... we have eliminated that the FC isnt the issue, the ESC, and motor... sooo why is it not spinning?",@JefFPV (AUTEL Pilled)
"What do you mean ""What is it like?"". It's like looking at an analog signal on better displays than usual, I guess? Depends on the analog VRx you get TBH.. Truthfully, you'd be better asking that question over on the Walksnail discord. There are a few hypernerds over there that use Walksnail for things I hadn't even realised we're a thing.","does anyone know what the avatar x with an additional analog receiver is like, was looking at future upgrades and drones, and saw that the avatar can have an analog av input, which would allow me to keep my current drone without having to carry around 2 goggles. I've heard some things about latency between the receiver and the headset, but then there are also people that say it's not noticeable, was wondering if anyone had tired it here They'll probably be able to drop you comparison images and the like. Hmm I'll check them out I have the goggs x, but I dropped analog like a ticking grenade when I got em. haha, i can imagine, i can see this being a deep rabit hole, got analog not too long ago, but those goggles x been sitting in the back of my mind the whole time. just would be a hassel getting the parts to swap my drone over I need to be able to see WTF I'm going, and analog can't do that well enough for the cost of the kit.  Walksnail is more efficient per currency unit spent for performance. Just has a steep initial outlay if you want the versatility of the goggs x.. I enjoy working on and building quads as much as flying them, so I don't mind the work of swapping VTxs and shiz :PepeShrug:. Also CaddX have a huge discount thing on, if it's as till on. Like, 20% off everything.. Now would be the time. rn for where i fly and with my drone/ goggle setup its fine, my one antenna broke so im replacing those on the goggles, dont ask idk how it broke, i really only face issues when im far away or behind a bunch of trees. but the idea of digital is nice https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1094088023324491826/1296904770937819209 its not even the vtx, that i dont mind, its more the extra 3d printed parts i would have to order from iflight and stuff, and hoping the setup the drone rn is using can be swapped over. ooooo, ill have to check that out"
"What 3dprinted parts? the VTxs are standard pattern mounts, as are the cameras.","the antenna adapters, going from the 1 hole to the 2 hole, and then some other parts that iflight has on their eco it would be more like converting the analog frame to a semi digital frame version, but with standard X shape instead of DC. mauritius.... hahaha, i got all the stuff when i was last in germany. i would get a family friend or someone to bring it in when they come, along with more batteries I mean, shit, in the interests of getting a bro sorted out, I can print you any TPU bits you need (in black, natch). You'd have to pay the postage tho :KEKw: i think i know someone with a 3d printer which might be able to cut that problem out the way. and damn this price isnt bad for the goggles and a cam Yep.  Won't be a better deal for a long while I suspect. Well, the offer is there, if you get stuck :yellow_heart:"
"Did you take everything apart before swapping it back? This could be as simple as your ESC wire being upside down, like The the ""servo"" cable coming from the ESC being the wrong way around.   If it's not that I would check and make sure your outputs are set correctly to be motors, and ensure that they're all delivering PWM low.  If it's still not that, does the ESC initialize?  Traditionally there should be three ascending tones indicating the ESC has power followed by two tones indicating the ESC has initialized and is getting a PWM low signal. There can be other forms of tone instead but that's generally what's most common.","I doubt they'll off 20% again for a while.

Umm. What do i do with it?. And she is kinda bulki to be honest. Shes felling like that,Your charger should have a feature to discharge batteries to 0V. Do that outside
Why do i need to charge it to 0v?. She is finished?. Like going to the garbage after the discharge?,"Not charge, discharge. It makes the battery more or less completely inert. Yes, if it's that deformed"
:loudly_crying_face:. I can put an electrical tape on it or something?. Or an heat shrink?,"Hmm. Then yeah, it's not safe keeping it around"
Where is the sweet smell coming from?,Inside. The inside should never be exposed to the outside
Im not sure if its smell sweet. It has the smell of a regular plastic. More photos of the battery. Do you think that she is 100% belong to the trash can?,I probably wouldn't want to fly it The Magic Smoke:trade_mark: smell :chefkiss:
Is there alcohol-free flux? I can’t seem to find any. Not sure if this is where I’m supposed to ask or if this is only for drones but it’s kinda related,"What. Alcohol is usually used to dissolve flux away Its only goes down to 3.6v per cell No ""destroy"" setting, welp."
Is it a necessary component in it? Is there not alternatives without it,I'm not sure what you're after What's the point of capacitors on ESCs
Why does it need to be without alcohol? I'm not even sure if there is any alcohol in most flux mixtures. Filtering out noise and voltage spikes,"I’m Muslim so I don’t want to be touching alcohol even if it’s a little that’s why I’m wondering if there’s any alternatives Tho doing some research they don’t really specify if it has alcohol or not You can use solid rosin flux, but it's not the best Alright I’ll look into it. Thanks You're not supposed to be touching the flux anyway. Use gloves. I just went to check it out, flux paste does contain isopropyl alcohol. Solid rosin core flux shouldn't. But yeah, gloves Alright appreciate it It's corrosive by it's nature, that shit is awful for the skin."
Vitroid is there any other option to destroy a battery?,"It’s my first time soldering, getting a practice board and going to practice I dont have an option for that in my hota d6 Box of disposable examination gloves in your size. :yellow_heart:"
"I had to update my micro TX to the latest firmware, V6.36, because it was required for the Nano Pro model.

Does anyone know how to fix this?","Clear your telemetry sensors from the Model Telemetry page, and then re-discover them"
Broke off my elrs ceramic antenna 10 seconds ago in a crash what do I do now ?,"well I attached the FC to a whole other drone so that would be a different frame with motors previously mounted and working fine. Huh. Fair nuff, FC motor output faulty then. Get a new Rx, or AIO if it's an onboard Rx.  You *might* be able to stick a monopole whip antenna on it if you're good with a soldering iron."
I heard I can solder on a copper wire is that an option ?,"and one of them was already flashed with firmware the other wasnt and I did a fresh flash so I wouldnt think its firmware but I can try again Enameled wire specifically That would be option 2, the monopole whip antenna."
Do you know where to buy one ?,Short bit of enameled copper wire *just* the right length. Start a thread and put in there everything you've done so far. I can't be trying to piece it together from chat. You can check outputs in the servo outputs tab.  Also I would increase the motor throttle in the motor test tab as sometimes the PWM signal isn't enough to spin the motors. 15-20% should be fine. yeah I had been running it at 15%. I'll check outputs now. just pinged you both in a forum help
Should I get these? The guy is selling them for 50€ he says with less than 10 cycles. They look to be in good condition,"It *could* be a good buy, it might not be. Used lipos are a riskier purchase because they're consumables, regardless of how many cycles they've supposedly been though"
Would there be a way for me to tell if they are in bad condition?. Other than the correct voltage balance,"Sure, if the seller is willing to fully charge each lipo and send a picture of the IR readings for each one, that would be the best way to tell what shape they are in. Lots of work though and unlikely to happen I mean also if they where in bad condition I can return the package to the seller through this app That's a good thing. So you could purchase them and test them yourself, and then initiate a return if necessary"
Are you in need of batteries?. Specifically several 850 and 650 4S?,"It would be nice to have some more 4s ones, i currently have 2 4s 850mah batteries and 5 3s that I do t really use that often anymore since I converted my 3inch. Yea perfect sizes for my 3inch Sounds like it could be a good deal for you then Alright time to make my bank account suffer more than it already has. :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: Tell me about it, I'm going to spend $700 tomorrow on a used telescope It's a great deal, about 50% off new"
You buying a nasa telescope?? :face_with_tears_of_joy:. Sounds like a good one,"It's OK. A lot better than the one I have, but not my end-game scope"
Is it one of those ones that you can take photographs with?,I will in the future once I get a tracking mount that can handle the weight. Right now I just image with some telephoto lenses on my mirrorless camera Yea I always found that kind of videography cool I've posted some stuff in https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1147973911246549153.

"ik its a strange question but how do yall keep your gear not broken?. because like ive connected my 3"" to my pc and it has fried my aio somehow. also i built a tinywhoop and since i built it the aio is problematic and i need to replace it",Just tune it and it should work since motor wires are enameled. You want the exposed bit to be 1/4th wavelength
"@cyberFluke me again, was wondering how the power input works on the avatar systems, the first image is my vtx which all goes through one male to female connector, does the avatar one go through a port and then extra cables?","Become less bad at building, and after a time when you are out of the ""training phase"" you don't crash as much and you quads magically last a lot longer"
"No, they have both a port and solder pads, I think that's what the image is getting at. You can use either.. Is it the right length piece of wire?. I'm not fucking with you, it has to be the right length to tune the antenna.. Sim time.","oh ok, thanks got me confused with the diagram. practice anything im learning in sim, then look for a real world place thats simmilar, im learning split s tricks atm, so im using goal posts and ruby posts, places that have open space that if i mess up its soft ish grass, and not hard tarmac or a tree"
Did you use m2 screws for that? I do not have m2 nuts really. But I do have m3 screws and nuts. Do you think it will work to try make the screw hold larger so a m3 screw can fit? And can I use med solder iron for that do you think?,hey guys what does expo do change how curved the rate curve is idk how to explain it further you have more precision in the center but moves faster the closer you get to the edges
when what says outdoor light?,"idk im looking at the beginners shopping list and i got no clue what most things mean oh that. light outdoor flying implies that it can be flown outdoors but only ""lightly"" - ideal conditions like no wind etc... For me I used some screws that I had from some servo hardware, so I don’t really know what size they are. The important thing is that they screw into the pigtail socket and through the the hole. So If that works for you then great i started buying quality parts and stopped flying over concrete. Although I still have stuff break randomly, my tinywhoop is broken rn. Just have more quads so some of them always work lol whats the benefit/tradeoff of high or low kv motors high kv motors are faster at the expense of efficiency"
so faster but more power draw/heat?,"yes, but the power draw is non-linear. you might get 25% more thrust at the cost of 30% more power draw"
would a small battery strap work?,"didnt work. i dont discover anything Any Ideas on how to better attact a battery to a darkstar 20, I dont like the trey method. perhaps, I was thinking that or a rubber band 100% go with a battery strap. a rubber band will not provide enough force id also get some [Ummagrip](https://pyrodrone.com/products/ummagrip-universal-super-sticky-battery-pad) or [Ummagrip Lite](https://pyrodrone.com/products/copy-of-ummagrip-lite-super-sticky-battery-pad-choose-color) to be safe @Cerberus (Anzu Pride)"
"I wanna make sure im thinking about this right. when you turn, its less about steering and more about like changing direction right?. like you wanna orient your props to the direction you want to change towards and then thrust up to shift ur momentum that way. so turning is more about understanding where your drone is going and adjusting based off of that. rather than like a car where you can steer freely and have no worry of momentum","If it doesn’t discover any sensors at all then there is some other problem with the telemetry. I don’t know enough about crossfire to be helpful here, but you might consider making a thread in #help-with-drones ya its weird, because the old version it works fine"
now B4UFLY is no longer in service. what app or website should I use?. and those brown place is school. can I just fly around?,[Aloft](https://airaware.aloft.ai/)

so what would you recommend?,"idk which others are good, just saying"
There’s no settings I can change?. I don’t think you can take the antennas off,I mean you can set it to 25Mbps. And a lower resolution
Thoughts on soldering luke this?,I like it that way. At least for builds where you're not swapping motors often. It can technically introduce some more noise to the gyro but I don't think that was ever tested. And I can't notice anything wrong Maybe greater risk of shorting stuff if you foolishly leave excessive exposed wire lol
"Nice! It should be pretty translatable?. If you’re going to say sim, I’m getting a radiomaster pocket to use over the winter, then in spring I’ll get the Crux35. So I want to have sim practice first definitely. I haven’t yet",Stupid light enter key
"So I plugged a vtx cable into the vtx wired it up wrong and had smoke come out of it, fixed the wiring and leds still come on and it still heats up but no video. I’m guessing it’s broken but wanted to ask here if there is anything I could do to fix it while I wait on a new one to arrive? Nothing looks burnt on the board either. I even used a smoke stopper and this still happened somehow",smoke stoppers don't protect against reverse polarity
"I just bought the caddy ratel 2 analog camera and I am noticing delay with it, what would be the best way for me to lower it? My last camera had way less latency and it was cheaper. I have it set to pal and 16:9","disable WDR, that doubles the latency. but double of ~18ms isn't that much either"
"well, what kind of. analog ones? PAL/NTSC matching?","Oh I didn’t know my goggles could have different ones. I’m using the sky zone cobra x goggles sure, the arduino just has to talk the same protocol as the elrs. crsf or change it on the RX to sbus. there should be libraries for that I just checked it and it’s on auto so analog goggles and no missmatch. that makes it hard to guess a reason then Yea it’s really weird because I’ve been using the caddx ant and there was less latency. Everything else on the drone is the same. So it has to be something to do with the camera but analog cams have nowhere to store the image, so no way to add latency. the moment the line on the sensor is read, it goes out into RF. at worse the WDR setting will do an average of two exposures, so two frames but that's it"
If my SMA antenna mount is hard to remove do I still need something under it so it not change position?,"no, there are cameras that have more latency than others. @DædalusFPV The Caddx Ant has incredibly low latency for an analog camera. 14ms on average. Idk about the Ratel 2, but the latency for the original Ratel was 20-24ms depending on PAL (20ms) or NTSC (~24ms). Just because they don't ""store"" an image, doesn't mean there aren't ways to increase the latency. Signal processing, the size of the sensor, the specific circuit design--these are all things that have an impact. Most low TVL cameras have a low latency in the ""teen"" ms range, where high quality WDR cameras like the Foxeer Toothless are 30+ms. The Caddx Ant seems unique to me in its high TVL but super low latency, probably because it lacks a lot of processing features to make it smaller. I could use some additional context like a picture to understand your issue how to calculate thrust force based on drone specs(motor specs and propeller dimensions) No calculate, only test. Multiple test, extrapolate, ""semi-educated guess"" bro :loudly_crying_face: bro :loudly_crying_face: you got like an average for a basic FPV drone Sure, an average 5"" 6S quad has a max of 1500gF-1700gF on each motor. That's absolute peak performance though, and obviously goes down as the battery drains The plastic thing that the sma antenna is on"
"Do you think I need something under it?. So it does not move down, or should it work if it is hard to remove","If you have a hard time moving it by hand, I would guess that it will be very unlikely to move on its own while you're in flight. Even if it does slide down a little bit, that will not affect your video performance or anything else Would it be fine if I add my ELRS receiver on the top of the VTX"
i never claimed otherwise?. i specifically explained the difference in latency of plain and WDR cam modes. here's a nice comparison of different cams for anyone caring: https://oscarliang.com/fpv-camera-latency/,honestly without the context of the first message you sent. it seems like you're just saying analog cameras can't have added latency and all that. so that's my bad
"for legal safety - unless posted, is it safe to fly a small drone (<240g or what not) in an (empty) park if there are no 'no drone' signs?    https://www.uasidekick.app/  doesn't list any restrictions in the parks near me, but double checking if i'm missing anything (I'm in Pittsburgh PA if that matters)","250 grams is I think equivalent to a seagull hitting you at speed. a tinywhoop could drop from space and full throttle down and it'll never be able to hurt you. It's specifically sub250 because it is a very safe weight. if you want to actually be compliant with the law it'll be harder and honestly basically impossible on a tinywhoop. you'd have to ask in #drone-laws Nice, didn't see that chat, apologies for cross post.  Just trying to not be negligent. 6 one way, half a dozen the other. The important part is making sure to get the receiver's antenna out away from the fuselage It's not common pratice to place two components that transmit/receive signals as close as possible, they might interfere a bit  if you're unlucky uhh. might be a dumb question. but what is gF grams of force.

"Because proprietary bullshit to intentionally maintain a variance from ""standard"".  DJI are the Apple of the drone world.  Make sense now?",Why is DJI so different when it comes to VTXs. Different wire layout and stuff. And antennas the comparision to apple is perfect. I also wanted to say that
Innit? :face_with_tears_of_joy:,"The only good thing I can think about with DJI is its polished but thats it really and Bambu is the DJI of the printer world they are also kind of connected, you can download the dji app in the app store but need to go on the dji website to download the apk for android Great now I want to rant but it won't make sense outside of this chat :stare: antennas is because of the sbus receiver inside. because we needed that. a shitty control link that costs 200 dollars yea, not bad, but limited for experienced users I keep forgetting I use :exploding_head: more than  :thumbs_up: and keep accidentally reacting with :exploding_head: no like they are literally former DJI employees and are using the same tactics and all to gain popularity not to mention they profit off of a lot of open source progress. without ever contributing back i mean they make good printers but their slicer is awful"
"Is the best way to have the ELRS receiver on the place that I marked in the image with cable ties, or just under the camerawithout cable ties?","1. carbon fiber is conductive, so isolate the reciever from it somehow 2. mount it in whatever non-damaging way you want 3. position is fine as long as it isn't sitting on a vtx or something like that 4. mount the antenna underneath one of the front arms with a ziptie. Place the receiver in a way that makes it easy to route the antenna for that. @wilmer Would it be possible to put the ends of this wire in a random plug or do I need to do something special to put wires into a connector, the wires need to have pins crimped onto the ends of them. these wires are set up to be soldered you can splice an existing plug with wires onto them though @Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST). if you have an existing plug with the right connector and some wires... So would it be possible to take the wires from an existing plug Clear shrink wrap was included, so go with it. Since it has two antennas, I think it might work best to have it in the middle between the camera and fc as in the picture I have this but the ends need to be changed that is where I'd put the receiver @wilmer"
for what sort of build would that be?,"I am still  new with the drones, more specifically quadcopters. I could send you a manual I am using, so you could see if you are up to."
"sure, send it here. or preferably in the other channel where you already got some help. interesting. do you really want to make something that you have to assemble with separate modules and program from scratch yourself? Or just to build a drone with pre-made parts?","everything from scratch. Mainly interested for the software side. but I want to know how every single part works hmmm okay. the guide shows some parts that are quite outdated. but on the other hand, the modern equipment would require different libraries and functions in the code which aren't described in the guide I think the manual is 1 or 2 years old"
Then why does it use individual escs?,it lists some stuff that's like 10 years old at this point I guess feeding pwm is easier than dshot but you can do that with blheli_s escs too well I suppose a PWM ELRS receiver and radio system could be used instead of legacy stuff like FlySky
how do i update my walksnail goggles X fonts?. i configured the ini file. and put all the files on. but the button is greyed out,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) you might know whgar. oh. where did you put them
"I'll do my own custom font one day. That day is not today, but tomorrow, who knows?","time to bug you about it till you do it. obviously Everyone will hate it. It'll be a replica of an old LED dot display font. Same as I made for my watch :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: oh gosh. you'd totally wear one of those converter casio watches. <https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-watch-pro> https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzNfY2V. What size hardware should i use for sum like dis I wouldn't mind having a pink-ish JetBrains Mono font for my OSD Took me a while, the watch battery is dead atm :KEKw: To be fair, it shouldn't be a difficult job. I could probably just scale the watch one up, it's made of individual pngs already.  My, what a pain in the tits that job was."
"can someone please help... is this an actual thing? is my drone gonna be fried cause I havent flown in a while... i cant figure out what's joking or not, i just dont want my tinywhoop to be broken cause the stupid vtx died so I havent flown it...","waffles it is a joke. a drone isn't bread, it doesn't have anything that goes bad randomly ok thank you finally. i just know sometimes electronics can deteriorate (mechanical parts mostly) but if they sit for a while they can get worse, didnt know if that happened with drones and electronics... like cars and their engines for example, its best practice to start your car every once in a while to keep parts moving and functioning... cars have fluids and are purely mechanical What’s the difference between XT60 and XT30 and how do I know which to get 30 and 60 refer to their amp rating, 30 amps and 60 amps"
Oh so if I get a charger rated XT60 I can’t charge XT30 batteries?,"buy or make an adapter. its just a connector, nothing special.  if you where to put say 100amps through a xt30 it would likely melt So I should get the charger and battery which are both XT30 for simplicity sake yeah"
"Ok thx. Just to make sure, without the adapter an XT60 charger won’t work with an XT30 battery right?. Sry if these are dumb questions I’m just rlly confused abt what stuff to get","no, xt60 and xt30 cannot plug into one another. adapters are cheap or are simple to make"
So if I just got the adapter everything would be fine?,personally id get an xt60 charger then use xt30 adapters So if I got all this stuff it would work together fine
stay away from that charger. SkyRC has a history of lighting peoples houses on fire. The ToolkitRC M7 DC is a good alternative. do you already have something to power it?,"I was just gonna plug it into my wall That is not possible with that charger, it’s powered off DC. if you want to plug it straight into the wall you’d need a charger with an integrated power supply such as the Hota D6 Pro that battery is also not a great idea, way underpowered"
Oh wow alr. Bc I need smth for my crux 35. Charger and batteries. Would the ToolkitRC M4AC be a good choice?,what's your budget for charger. and batteries Like as low as possible <https://pyrodrone.com/products/hota-t6-dc-300w-pd-90w-15a-1-6s-lipo-battery-charger> <https://pyrodrone.com/products/toolkitrc-adp-100-100w-battery-charger-power-supply-xt60> <https://pyrodrone.com/collections/4s-batteries/products/gaoneng-gnb-4s-15-2v-880mah-160c-hv-lipo-battery-xt30> <https://pyrodrone.com/collections/4s-batteries/products/cnhl-850mah-4s-70c-ministar-14-8v-li-po-fpv-battery-xt30>

"So basically id plug that thing into the wall, and then the charger into that thing?",Ah ok thanks. This stuff complicated you should look up the difference between AC and DC power. and why it is that way Do I need to get an adapter with this btw. The xt30 to xt60
https://pyrodrone.com/products/xt60-to-xt30-charge-adapter?variant=31948639895595. you want xt60 female to xt30 male,what voltage should I land/stop flying at with 6S wooper just use average voltage on your osd. just like any lipo land when hovering at 3.5v i do :PepeSad:. i was wondering since leah said that they fly their bassline down to like 3v leah a bit silly. lol. but i also assume they might have shit batteries. that sag a lot
Does anyone know how to turn up my mW on my DJI Integra goggles?,"Which way do I face these when putting them in a plug. In general or past a certain point In general. I do want it to go the highest it can oh okay that kinda sucks Tooth pin side towards the sealed tooth catch side on the plug You'd have to do the FCC unlock for that, as for how you navigate to change it I'm not sure I’ve already done that. I can’t find anything on the menu to change the power output"
Like this?. Try this maybe. Didn't read the greyed out part,My goggles don’t have an option for the switch to digital fpv system It might be done through the remote. Use your phone/smart controller to try switching This side is where the tooth on the pin will catch
"Hi, question, can you use ""dynamic idle"" without having to tune the PID and filters?",Tooth side on the left here. Once u have it in it should feel snug and the plastic retainer should grip the hook. You pic looks backwards since the retainer is bent up Itll def seem and feel like it all lines up right when u have it right. @Llama how can I get these pins down all the way. I might have pushed them up too far. They are sticking out the tiniest bit and refuse to go in the plug on my FC https://youtu.be/fh9gvhobVro Yeah I don't think my operation worked. I think there is an LED on here that isn't lighting up. I don't see any WiFi network being made. Pretty sure that white spec in the top left is an LED ew why no. why no pads on that board. also those pins definitely don't look insrted correctly What :loudly_crying_face:. Other side. I don't see how I'd put them in wrong I had the tooth facing down. Yes why not just solder it then Because I don't want to :red_heart:. I thought this would be easier you woulda been done hours ago. soldering is always easier https://tenor.com/view/epic-topic-change-epic-topic-change-epic-topic-gif-12159139147954124590. Anyway how did I do it wrong first of all. is your 5v even working I don't see why it wouldn't is that receiver even plugged in all the way and can you show a clear picture of the metal part of the connector I tried. Let me get the other side. Only the white wire seems off which shouldn't effect power i guess but. the whole plastic part is like. almost snapped on it. which would prevent it from plugging in all the way. even if it felt like it did Well it looked like it did. Its got a little locking mechanism yeah. but surely you see how this is a problem Not really :face_with_peeking_eye:. They look like they are where they should be. Besides the plastic. I did kind of bend it far the plastic that is literally crucial to the whole function of the thing I'm gonna look for a new plug and just solder. Why do they make the most important parts the tiniest ones :PepeSad: these things are VERY finnicky for the record. learning how to crimp this stuff took me hours. (im not the smartest though) That looks fine to me. and I've probably forgotten completely by now As long as the pin actually seats in well. Then the plastic housing being a bit mangled is. :man_shrugging:. But if it's not making a connection then def that's the place to look i would check with a multimeter if the 5v is even working at all Doesn't matter. No other plug works for it Well I won't be using the plug
okay but like still good to know if your 5V is working???,:PepeShrug: I can live without it you literally can not. your receiver works off of 5v. how the hell are you going to power it if your 5v doesn't work The pads. I am not using the plug it doesn't matter if it's the pads or the plug. if your 5v doesn't work it doesn't work on either Hm. Thought they were seperate. Let me get this plug in and check. Are you proud of the solder (don't mind the flux mess or the VTX in the back :aaaa:. what is thattt. @Leah did you teach him this Are those not the beads you want wtf i did not. not my teaching Fine @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I'll send you my FC to resolder everything. (You're covering shipping). @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) fuck you (not really :PepeLove: ) my solders are amazing no this is a literal disaster What is wrong with them :loudly_crying_face: the mountain of solder I don't see 2 wires touching :thinking_face:. Think it's fine. I'll put less on this last one one little pull on the wires. and it is coming off. lol Fuck it we ball. https://tenor.com/view/fuck-it-we-ball-guy-in-suit-black-guy-in-suit-meme-gif-9989487814461476583. what does a solid red light on my FC mean. both my pc and phone cant connect to it on betaflight
You mean wonderfully?. Look at how safe I am,im scared of how this is going to go The very short screw and washers are spares. You only care about the long screws Quick question how big of a difference between ev800d and skyzone cobra So def worth the extra 200 got it. Well my shopping list is finished ig
Why is the solder so dark?,"make sure to use plenty of flux and dont be afraid to crank that heat up. Specially when you do the battery leads I’m waiting on a flux pen, current rosin is shit. Nothing is even smoking when I’m soldering"
What kv motors should i use for a 3s lightweight 2.5inch toothpick?,99% sure i had that same soldering iron at some point
Do yall have any simulators yall recommend over others?,"Like 6000kv or so, with some 1103-1203 motors Personally for a toothpick I would go lower cell count to 1-2s I have a bunch of 3s bats though. 450mah. Gtg work Velocidrone but it's got a key system that makes it annoying to play the game on more than one device"
"""An annoying key system"" that doesn't let you run it on multiple machines simultaneously.  Never had any issues with that bit myself. What about it is annoying?",Playing it on my steam deck and Pc and constantly having to sign in again since you can only be signed in to one device

Definitely annoying That's an Aliexpress product title if I've *ever* seen one. Those antennas are just fine
"im having an issue with videos recorded on my Moonlight Kit with a 5-inch drone. When I transfer the videos to my computer using a micro-SD, some of them play normally, but others won’t open at all, even when I tried using VLC.

Most of the time they are partially recoverable with [this tool](https://github.com/anthwlock/untrunc)
Hey guys!. How the hell can I un  bridge this? It doesn’t seem to want to,"flux, hot iron, heat both pads and drag the tip to the outside Or use solder wick or a solder sucker Okay I tried that and it didn’t work, so far it looks like this"
Did you actually use flux?,Yea. A lot of it aswell. With copper wick
"Aren't the ""bridged"" pads just a pair of GND pads?",they do look like empty pads now
"The heatsink from my esc is pretty big, will this be a problem if I run my wires like this? They are touching the fc and are getting a bit squished, but are still movable. My biggest concern is the wires melting and shorting the fc","The wires aren't likely to melt or short, but you don't want them affecting the soft-mount of the FC, so you don't want them touching. I would not run them like this at all. If you insist on running them around the post, go under the ESC. Otherwise, and I would recommend, don't try to go around the post--go directly to the ESC Alright. Might run them outside and print something to protect them instead They're most vulnerable on the arms where your prop might strike them if it gets bent. At the ESC connection, if you rip that off in a crash... you are going to be doing a lot more than re-soldering a motor that also might cause them to be squished between your fc and whatever protector solution you come up with"
"Yes they are, does that matter?","It doesn't. In reality, they were actually already bridge, you just managed to remove the ""skin"" on top of the PCB and exposed their connection"
"It's my first build, I'm wondering... Have I bought a slight too large lipo or is that normal?","looks normal-ish. CNHL Blacks are just kind of not great batteries. tend to be heavier and bigger than all the others. plus don't last as long lifespan wise. your frames also just kind of slim looking Looks like a Source One V5. 1300mAh 6S is fine, it just looks amusingly large"
does the pack say anything about the discharge rate? cause higher rate capability usually means thicker cells,"It has 100C printed on the pack, that's the spec'd discharge rate oh right. it's right there. inverted reading is hard ɐllǝɟ ƃᴉq ɟlǝsɹnoʎ ɹoɟ ʞɐǝdS oh okay thanks a lot i didnt know that those cnhl packs also have a lot of protective padding lol Good. They were not as expensive as tattu r-line, for my first drone they should be enough, I'll probably upgrade once I get better well no like. you can get better batteries for around the same price Just going through Pyrodrone rn for 1300mAh 6S packs. $28 - Tattu FunFly                - 1300mAh 22.2V 6S 100C $28 - CNHL MiniStar             - 1300MAH 22.2V 6S 120C $29 - Gaoneng GNB                - 1300mAh 22.2V 6S 120C $30 - CNHL Black Series            - 1300MAH 22.2V 6S 100C $36 - Pyrodrone Graphene        - 1300mAh 22.2V 6S 130C $37 - Tattu R-Line Version 3.0     - 1300mAh 22.2V 6S 120C $38 - Tattu R-line Version 4.0     - 1300mah 22.2V 6S 130C. I would say the CNHL Ministar and GNB packs are the better value compared to CNHL Black, at least right now. But, like, the core point remains valid. There's no reason to buy R-lines when you're just starting out They're in Europe. DOGCOM UCell and GNB packs are cheap. cheaper than you can usually get CNHL packs if you're willing to sacrifice 100mAh, these go for $21 https://pyrodrone.com/products/cnhl-1200mah-22-2v-6s-100c-speedy-pizza-lipo-battery-with-xt60-plug-1. and they're fairly cheap in the EU as well. I was very attached to the product image attachment, why remove it :angerysock:. :Kek: Yea I think if you're really value shopping you'd go to the length of getting a $/Wh value and then doing a scored ranking based on quality assessment and value"
Which temperature should I use on my TS101 for the happymodel ELRS heat shrink?,"Don’t do heatshrink with a soldering iron. Do it by holding a lighter below it. And just rotate it. Not in the flame, above the flame hmm, have installed the ELRS receiver already so it is not very much space for a lighter can try Be careful then…. Usually you put on the heatshrink right after soldering and putting on the antenna Its very much other wires near, are you sure that my soldering iron isnt a better alternative, I think it easter to make it more precise then should be fine as long as you dont melt it, so low temp Yes. And if it doesn’t work just turn it up SLOWLY till it does. But for next time solder the receiver first so there are no wires in the way. And just use a lighter"
Will that damage the components around?,Depends what components those are. And how long you apply the heat. And so on Also more convenient than a lighter for doing it he correct way (before you put it in)
how can i put [this](https://shop.iflight.com/BLITZ-ATF435-Flight-Controller-Pro2053?search=BLITZ%20%20ATF435%20Flight%20Controller) flight controller in DFU mode or fix a solid red light on it,"what does the red light mean usually it will have a blue flashing one too but for some reason it doesnt and i can get it to connect to betaflight. no clue, cant find anything but a wiring diagram"
no silkscreen next to it?,nevermind. upon plugging in a battery instead of USB i get every light but blue okay well. hold the boot button and plug it in. show what shows up in device manager let me look for whatever the linux equivalent is rq. hopefully this suffices right i forgot. lsusb. might list it give me like 5 minutes. got to unscrew everything i lied. its because my ESC is above my FC. only had to undo the top frame though. anyway assuming the button by the usb c port is the boot button it did nothing well yeah goofball show the list. `lsusb`. some unholy names dont disrespect the schiit are you using a c-c cable no a-c. c-c does work though
the red led is 3.3v right?,according to the manual/wiring diagram yeah
that's the only one showing up??,"yeah. i feel like 5v should be visable too did this happen after you wired up the elrs receiver yeah. i turned it on with a smoke stopper without issue, then a battery, realized i need to change my ports, realize i cant connect the FC to BF. i might have started with usb actually. so something may have shorted but i doubt it since it worked/works fine try desoldering one of the elrs things i guess. nothing showing up just means there's literally nothing happening on the other ends. like you could see if `dmesg` spits out something. `lsusb -v`. i can't remember the damn commands"
i assume you want the FC connected when running that?,yeah with the boot button. `dmesg | grep -i USB`. all of these. and otherwise show FC pictures gonna unsolder the ELRS receiver now
what's going on with that? just flux?,"think so. think i remember it being like that. ill wipe it down rq. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) yeah its just flux you gotta clean that stuff. after you're done @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) should i take the solder off the pads or nah ok i got it all off except for a tiny bit where the white wire for the ELRS receiver is just give it a try. just trying out stuff since you don't have a multimeter or anything see if you have 5v, 3v. just from the usb port i can try but i think the prongs for my multimeter are too big. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) what part of it is 5v and 3v. Or do you mean with USB in checking pads yes have the usb plugged in. then just test the 5v, 3v pads. i don't really know what this accomplishes at this point though What. The. Fuck. So something was up with my solder or something. Anyway. Any tips on avoiding this @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) this about to be some bullshit. so next time you clean the flux off since that is pretty important. but also this is probably just some weirdo issue. which uart did you solder it to 2. Previous one was on 2 also. I can try 3 or 5 also I think The plug is UART 4. Solder is UART 2 I'll do it later since I'm about to eat but I'll update you on how it goes tx to rx and rx to tx"
Hey so I bought a new charger since my old one was making funny sounds and i'm curious about something does it matter if i charge with ac over dc?,"What do you mean by does it matter. Ah. Well it converts ac into dc anyway well i googled something and it told me dc was better. oh really sick lol ty How would it charge a battery with AC, lol dude idk im dumb i dont know much about this. but that makes sense now that i use my brain. it says ac/dc on it so i figured it was different The difference is the built in ac to dc power supply can only do 500w, but if you plug in a 1000w dc power supply, it can do 1000w"
ohhh. is 500w enough to charge 4 batterys at 1c?,"like 6s 1300 or lower Ok, what voltage is a 6s battery. At max How many amps is 1c for that battery 1.3 i think right lol are u making me think. how dare you 32.76. i had to find calculator 32.7 watts per battery nice. ok thank you dude. for teaching me *(well, technically that doesn't take into account that there is other stuff going on inside the charger or the inefficiency of the charger)* Yeah, but to be more precise. 32.7 * 4 << 500 Yeah I'm not disagreeing with that It means it's a lot smaller Technically I’m stretching the definition, it’s more meant to be “is basically zero in comparison to”"
oh ok. and btw its safe to just use any xt60 to xt30 ?  Im trying to figure out what t o buy so I can charge this new drone i got coming from the research I did it seems like it doesnt matter what adaptar i use,Which 124 and 500 are not. Yeah the current is so low even a shitty adapter will do fine awesome thanks again for all the help
they should be about the same size. but why do you want the t15?. what are you going to be doing?. boxer should be around the same size as a t15,freestyle. rn i use the dji fpv controller with a nazgul but i need to put elrs on it T20 is a good option to look at dji keeps cutting out it's the middle one in the right picture ive held that one before. didnt like it much this one too. its way too small
so boxer crush vs boxer vs t15?,i think t15 is gonna be best for me. not sure what boxer crush is. i was gonna get boxer but it seems way more expensive than t15 the t15 is 130. boxer 10 dollars more but the t15 looks so cool. THE BOXER CRUSH IS ALMOST 200 WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE. yea im gonna get t15 lmao oh is it like the tx16 ones. they super smooth for some reason UK stores decided not to like. translate the actual value. 140USD = 140GBP of course
130 for uk but it shouldve been cheaper is its $140 ?. £107. converted from $,in the US the Boxer is 140USD. T15 is 160 but importfees or something. oh damn i wonder why it cost so much in uk. i mean i wonder why its cheaper. the t15
you think it would be good for me? the tx12 feels like sizewise it just feels cheap to hold. im not sure about the gimbles,it just says hall vs m. - Gimbal Size: standard full size gimbals - Gimbal Sensor: Hall sensor gimbals the boxer will feel better built. but either will feel better. lol anything will feel better built that what i have rn lmao tx12 is just a pool noodle
ive been using my tx12 for like 5 years. it creaks when i hold it. to me atleast i like the t15. im just not sure sizewise. need a small controller like the tx12. ive seen people call it pocket does that mean its small?,"they're about the same size tx12, boxer, t15. around the same guess im getting t15 then. tx12 is retiring finally lmao. another question though. the tx16 is way bigger than the tx12! what do they mean in that picture! yeah. that's a weird one ive held it in person its so big. why did they make it so big lmao. the gimbles look bigger on the boxer im still going towards t15 the sticks look closer to the edge. they look kind of short on the t15 though. are these normal sised. sized"
"oh they just look weird in the image. also. should i put cell batteries or a lipo?. in the t15. says it will take any 2s lipo. or these  2x21700, 2x18650",21700 are probably the best option yea i think im gonna get them. in my tx12 they are 2600mah can always return/sell if you don't like them i most likely wouldnt see a diff. never had a real fpv controller. i dont consider dji or trhe tx12 real ones. the tx12 gimbles are horrible ive never seen the point of the tx12. it came out at a weird time. jumper made a faulty t-lite and radiomaster had the tx12 as their only other option
"Do you pinch, thumb or hybrid? Send a pic of how you r currently holding your current DJI controller and we will have a better idea of what radio is a good fit for your hand/grip.",i do pinch but it might be hybrid. i put my thumbs ontop of the stick and my pointers on the front of the stick
do your pointer finger tips always stay on the stick? Or do you some times take them off and rely on thumb only?,"always stay on the stick i never use thumbs only its horrible for control lmao. i think its hybrid. literally this. this is how i hold it Then your more of a ""pinch"" with a lower grip. ""hybrid"" is usually more described as when you occasionally take off the pointer fingers IMO.  So this means your probably gonna be most comfortable with radios that have: wide variety of stick height possibility. relatively flat and boxy shape edges. overall a larger size. cant use large controllers i use boxy ones though. i have super small hands"
have u used the taranis u pictued above?. or a boxer?,only reason im using dji one currently is im too lazy to get elrs for my drone. i have like 5 years of experiance with radiomaster tx12 boxer is probably the closest to your current DJI V1 radio. ive only used dji radio for like a year
the T12 isn't cramped for you?,no. i like how small it is its like perfect. the tx12 is the size of my hand. i like to push the sides with my palm and grip the sticks If you are good on the T12 then I'd suggest you try a pocket next. The RM pocket is really close in size and gimbal distance from the edges.
the t15 is a pocket right?,i dont like the other pocket that one was way too small. this one here i dont like it. its too small. my friend uses it needs to be similar size to the tx12. just more updated lmao well thats pretty much the same to me in size ETC to the T12. I've got larger hands so all the small radios r a fight to me equally oh you know what if the boxer is the same size as the t15 it looks good to me pocket slander will not be tolerated Def try to find a local buddy and hold their radio a bit aint got no local people near me lmao all the people whos gotten into fpv was because of me. i just reccomended them all the radiomaster pcokets as they are cheap. yea i think i gonna go with it. boxer looks good in that pic Recommend the next person a boxer then lol. :KEKw: recommend them a flysky nirvana :misc_nod_bugcat: they wouldnt spend the money on it one of my friend used a tx16 but they had it before bec they flew planes. thats so cursed ive seen that for sale on facebook One local guy got that and I did get to see it in person. Wasn't too bad TBH. RX support fell off hard or never existed tho. :Harold: I genuinely wanted it im watching drone jesus review of the t15 rn It and zorro and the turnigy evolution ETC never worked for me once I transitioned to pinch. My fingers would collide with the screen lol. i just hit them with a long sharp metal stick make sure there nothing flameable closeby though. joshua bardwell Made me think of this meme:
i believe it. ive just noticed the boxer has rubber grips but the t15 dont?,"im looking for a method that doesnt involve more flames im not sure how safe it is to discharge a battery with damage like yours thats a boxer but theres rubber grips on it i dont see anything like that on the t15 if ya mean side plate or back plate grips, you can essentially ignore it. It won't really be a make of break kind of thing. your hands and neck strap are what keeps the radio in place.  The grips are essentially irrelevant. yea i just like the quality feel of that bit lmao i see how its invalid though i mainly just squeeze the sides of the controller and push down on my neck strap. why is there even a boxer then a boxer t15"
those are an addon. right?,oh wait HUH the t15 has them too! There also exists grip tape addons you can get later on if you needm here is an example: https://www.buddyrc.com/products/ummagawd-tango-tape
the t15 has the grips too. wow batteries that dont rattle around in your controller? thats new to me mine are just free floating in the tx12 lmao,"T15 is a jumper product boxer is a radio master product. They used to be one but then split.  Oddly enough even tho they are now ""separate"" they usually do the same thing as each other constantly. :man_shrugging: it was a bit more complicated than that huh i thought it was all the same brand radiomaster. is the screen making that controller look massive"
red is still 5v on the plug. is it not?,@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) photos are impossible but do the black and yellow look connected. I really think the solders are fine but it won't power up. Fc works fine though on the bright side though. Better photo kind of those are wauy better joints than u had before at least. still bit too much solder but like. nice Anyway fuck it we going full solder. Idk what the issue is but it ain't my soldering. I'm just gonna solder both ends. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) it should be possible right. With these pads on it It won't power on. And I had issues before with the plug in that photo. It didn't power on but then I soldered the fc end why is the yellow wire on 5v Cus of the way I put the wires in the plug I'll fix it if I go through with soldering the other end No it's swapped in the plug too. Red is RX There was pads on the other side this whole time. :neutral_face: Ummmm yeah. Is this directed towards me or just in general
it has a destroy mode no?,not based off what im seeing
"i dont have a resistor to plug into the channels tho for ext discharge. i assumed i needed tht?. using the batt as power supply, and then pumping into channel 1 or 2 with a resistor or whatnot. i also have an hglrc parellel board and it has a discharge circuit on it but it says it cuts off at 3.8. which is really annoying",Honestly probably use the battery as a power supply for the charger and charge another battery or something Use the pack you wanna kill as power souce. then charge a different pack a .1A Should eventually kill the source pack if tyou have no source voltage cutoff set. hmmm. min input is 6.5v. so 1.6v for a 4s which is what i need to kill
@Tydude2641 XT60 to USB C adapter by any chance?,"i have a batt cell checker that does that Could use the battery to charge your phone or laptop maybe i dont rly want anything near the batt, the esc on my explorer went up in smoke/flames and the batt got a lil singed I have a adapter I use but idk if it's safe to really charge anything with but if it's going through another device it should be fine 1.6V per cell is a very very inactive lipo if you safely get it to that point. Even at 3V per cell you can straight up chop a lipo cell in half with a metal blade and nothing happens. once you get to 1.6 you could also likely dead short the pack to itself to get it to 0 and it's likely not go poof.  ****DISCLAIMER*** be ready for possible poofs and surprises."
"anybody know what the LIXX mode is on the hota?. is it just for any lithium style battery?. cuz im thinking of using that, the lipo i need to kill is only 11mah, and i have a 3000mah lion which i could just dump power into","Play with it. If its same as mine its just for custom lihv settings. nifty, but not the function ur looking for"
"alright i think thisll work. granted. hmmm. if the LIPO gets LOWER than the LION, wont it backfeed and the charger will cancel?. or am i dumb?. man this is annoying. ima just go buy a bulb, and hook that up to the channel 1 and use ext discharge","Charger should not cancel so long as it's input voltage is above it's set input voltage cutoff.  It'll just step up the lower voltage to the charge voltage. Which is less efffecient ETC, but not a mojor concern for your use case. alright ill try it first. if it gives me trouble ima just leave the batt outside in some sand and go buy a bulb tomorrow lol also, depending on your yard and living situation. You can just chop the lipo with a machette and puncture all the cells. Then toss it in a bucket of water. i actually do have some sandbags from the hurricane in florida, i will think about it, just didnt wanna scare neighbors Florida man gives no fucks. Be more like florida man is it worth paying the extra £60 for boxer crush than the jumper t15  im really not sure ive never touched ""good"" gimbles besides the tx16 but the throttle one felt too smooth. t15 £130 boxer crush £190. could just get the normal boxer but idk if there will be a diff. yea im heading towards tx15 or boxer now. i dont see point of fancy gimbles when im just gonna do a bunch of freestlye Better resale value better longevity smoother more rigid action. perhaps a tad more precise.  If i was re-buying the radio I have now and have used for 8+ years and a fancier quality gimbal was an option for extra I def would. But it also depends your budget and how long you stick with it all in the long run. ive been stuck with the tx12 for about 5 years but i only really got a real fpv drone this year. been flying whoops before. rn my setup is nazgul 5 03 air unit dji goggles 2 dji controller fpv 2 this is another thing id tell you to try locally if u could. but since you can't yeah IMO the extra 60$ is worth it. using dji controller because im lazy. you think it would be the last controller ill need because if i end up getting the boxer or the t15 i feel like ill end up changing the gimbles anyways. due to them failing. my tx12 gimbles feel very light lately like they are failing. they very creaky new springs would likely help a lot there.. creaky is the plastic galding up on the sliders. you can wrap the sliders in teflon to alleviate that im not gonna waste the time on the controller anymore due to it being so old id like a more reliable controller. more up to daye. date then may as well spend the $$ on the more reliable longer lasting stuff"
the a01 gimbles last way longer?. (forgot how to spell them),"metal gimballs yes, will take a TON more to wear it down compare to plastic gimballs. people have been saying the t15 is also very plasticy feeling that would be because it is plastic i wonder what they mean by it because the tx12 is also plastic lmao :man_shrugging:  teflon slider mod thats what im thinking lmao. aint all of them plastic. this is a hard decision lmao ive got till next year anyways ill still end up using my dji one till i got a decision. foldable antenna on the t15 is nice. the boxer having the screw on antenna on my tx12 its already almost broken off. i use module elrs anyways"
"oof, sorry. if the battery's dead, then there's no magic thing to do. you're searching for a palm-sized piece of plastic. You could always bring out the goggles and use the scan button (most goggles have one?) to check if it's still transmitting, but honestly I'm not sure how long it'd take to drain a battery purely off of video transmitting power",Kinda figured as much. I did walk around scanning for a while.. Hopefully one of my neighbors find it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
:ooffice: good luck man. how'd it get lost? i.e. lost video? or flew somewhere unknown?,"Literally flew it over the house and we never saw it again. I figured I would find it out front, but it must have returned to its homeland if i set the usb uart to something else how do i modify params It's probably up in a tree or in my gutter. I need a drone to find my drone lol"
are you single tapping the button?. oh red led,My radiomaster tx16s ii only shows a solid red LED when I try to power it on
honestly a red led doesn't really mean anything as far as I can tell. what happens when you turn it on without sd card?,Lemme try. Same thing can you try this. > Bootloader: Turn off the radio transmitter. Pull both horizontal trim switches together and press the power button.
what voltage is your battery at?,"Give me a min. 3.58v. 2 18650 batteries 3.58 total or per cell. @DeerFat phew. hmm, another thing I've heard is try taking out the rtc battery, waiting a bit, then putting it back in"
Huh?. Open the radio and take out rtc battery?,"ah, and measure the voltage of that battery hmm. anyway the main reason of doing that is basically fully turning it off then on again next thing to try would be attempting to flash it I'm going to wait a couple of seconds before I reinsert it and see if it fixes it. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) @Sea_Kerman looks like that fixed the issue. Although I'm not sure if I should trust the radio with flying a drone and it freezes again :grimacing_face: I'd flash it to the latest of everything either way Alright, well thanks for the help!"
then what should i do if im trying build a drone for a competiition and it needs to be fpv and be able to carry payloads with a gripper or a magnet. ?,whats wrong with 3d prinitn a frame You get a lot more resonance (flies like crap) and/or it weights a ton and has a ton of drag (flies crappier) and/or they are a lot weaker than a carbon frame It's a lose-lose-lose situation also it might runaway if the resonance is particularly bad probably avoid helping them until they explain their reasoning from their comment before. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/886098469016723456/1299274353413853194
Regular lipos or HV lipos?,"Seems reasonable. I guess it's using the 3.5-4.2V range for the storage voltage, not 3.2V"
Boom!  Thank you! Where did you find that?,In the description of the link you sent Doh! Thank you. :winking_face:
So 3.85V is right for regular LiPos?,"3.85. Technically 3.8 is more theoretically ideal for a regular lipo. Assuming you check on it regularly to maintain that.  However the extra 0.05 isn't substantially negative to the cells health, when in long term storage. The extra .05 can be good for long term year+ storage when you will not attend and check on it or re balance and store charge. More convenient for the way we ususally forget about stuff like this.  Realistically either 3.8 or 3.85 is fine. But I vote 85."
Do I need to shrink it more or should this work?,"that's not really shrinked. doesn't matter if you zip tie it down, tho"
what voltage? 4s? 6s?,"you plug in the short saver to the drone, plug in the battery, and then press this button to test"
The battery goes in from the left?,ya battery can only plug in 1 way
Can I still fly this pack?,Yeah that's basically nothing
Is it supposed to be like that?,"Depends on what you want to learn, If it's just in general, go binge watch Bardwell, it will give you a good base Definitely tighten it more. It shouldn't move if you aren't actively pushing it with a bit of force, otherwise it can introduce jello into the footage"
"my soldering iron is absolute crap, i think I will get the TS101. which tip should i choose ?","I have the TS-BC2, TS-I, and the TS-B2 that it came with"
and which one do you use most of the time for drones?,"TS-BC2 and TS-C1 are really nice for the average pad work you do with drones Yea I use the TS-I most of the time and BC2 for larger pads. The C1 would be nice too for most work we do @cyberFluke yo, one more question, does the avatar pro camera work witht the dji camera mounts, iflight doesnt have a walksnail camera mount for my drone just dji The Pro camera is 19mm, same as any other micro-sized FPV cam, iirc. The DJI O3 is 21mm Worst case, some rubber grommets and a sharp blade will sort it, if you can't get some TPU bits printed to handle it.. That does of course assume that DJI didn't move the mounting holes to be dicks, which wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. this would be the mount. im currently using a normal 19mm analog camera, it just has 1 mounting hole. thats why its rubber mounts wont work The Avatar Pro camera has two holes, ~5.7mm apart i could try make a hole in my curernt one trying to configure a skystars am60 esc, but am32 configurator throws an error and cannot read the settings. i have a battery plugged in and the motors spin correctly, betaflight also recognizes it okay maybe show the error. do you have betaflight configurator open google says it may have something to do with readback prevention. not while in the esc config. cant find anything besides a wiring diagram online, at least speedybee provides documentation. hmm new technology"
did you actually check if it was like that in real life?,"The Walksnail cams mount with two holes, so work with those. also responds to remote input, idk what config is preloaded but it seems to be locked from the factory i mean they cost like nothing so i dont mind if it doesnt work unsure if this is through a resistor on board because there aren't any schematics can you show the motors tab on betaflight. and can you try esc-configurator. and can you check if the plug is properly seated tried it first, same error motors show up in betaflight and read correctly, though i cannot change the dshot settings because betaflight cannot write to it either i suspected the plug at first because i had to rewire some of the connections because the pinout was different for the skystars esc compared to the speedybee (it came with an unfinished plug with precrimped wires) but i think i connected everything correctly. at least following the diagram this would be A LOT easier if you just did what was asked FC, Flight Controller - The brains of the operation. Runs the flight controller firmware, probably Betaflight, though there are others.  ESC, Electronic Speed Controller - Turns the motor power signal from the FC into 3-phase power to drive the motor(s). For quadcopters, we now usually use a ""4-in-1"" with 4 ESCs on one board, one per motor.  Rx, Receiver - Recieves the control link signal from the Tx (Radio controller) and sends it to the FC. Also transmits telemetry data like battery voltage etc. from the FC back down the control link to the radio.  VTx, Video Transmitter - Takes the signal from the camera, encodes it for radio transmission, and sends it down the video link to the VRx (Video Receiver). Some have built-in DVR systems to record the video stream before transmission to give a straight copy of the feed without interference loss.  AIO, All In One - A combination of at least the FC and ESC from above, some have the lot, some just the basics.. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) Can you pin that please, save me ever having to write it again :KEKw: sure lol. Pinned a message.. time to check your repinning i followed these diagrams, although the speedybee lacks a tx/rx pin for the esc. unless its used for telemetry, they may just be incompatible, which would be odd but unsurprising"
probably wire up the telemetry to the tx pin on the esc no?,"i did, but im not sure they are used for the same thing. skystars has no reference for the pin functions... because it's nothing special. try turning off bidirectional dshot did that, now its beeping continuously after restart. and still doesn't read, with the same error. gonna try the old esc, nothing was wrong with it so it should read fine"
"(just posted this into #help-with-drones but I think it's a quick question... Is it ?) So : Hello guys ! I've just got my very first drone, a dji neo in the fly more pack : drone + RC N3. SO, i would like to know it it's possible to disable the camera stabilization (horizontaly at least) in order to see when the drone is rolling etc. I mean, is it possible tu disable this horizon balancing ? sorry if my question is idiot, I'm a complete beginner !","pretty sure this is possible, should be in settings probably under fly modes or similar option. check the manual actually there is no fly mode if I'm not using an fpv controller (that's at least what I understood) https://forum.dji.com/thread-252179-1-1.html the second is exactly what I want, I'm just unable to manage to take off rocksteady. nope, orientation lock sry. well, just saw he is using a camera and not a drone ahah lol whoops, if you're just using the phone controls you're probably not going to have a very nice time flying in full manual because the screen gives basically no feedback. i assumed you were using a controller with it. tested the old fc, reads with no issues, going to check the cable again to test continuity between the pins, if it still doesnt work im probably going to send it back. pretty disappointing tbh dude. okay. can you please. just show. the wiring. can you show what you've done. because it feels like we're playing an avoidance game with that ok lol, i dont think it will be of much help though as the fellas at skystars sent a plug with wires that are all the same color like I can ping people who know a whole lot more about these ESCs and how it needs to be wired, but like the wiring needs to be confirmed sorry I was afk, I'm using a controlle,r just not an fpv controller. I don't know if it's possible... by remonving the stabilisation, I hope to have a closer control mode to fpv one. of course without goggles and everything, just to have a dynamic control nothing about that looks right. but it's hard to tell. why they gotta make them the same color ikr, this is the diagram @The GGManiack @DædalusFPV"
Which FC and which ESC?. Failure to flash AM32?,speedybee f405 v4 fc skystars am60 esc FC doesn't communicate with the ESC at all. wiring looks... okay its reciving motor inputs and sending telemetry but can't be read/written to
What version of Betaflight on the FC?,"4.5.0. skystars says it came preloaded with am32, i wanted to change the startup melody + transfer config options from the old esc running bluejay"
"Are you using the AM32 Configurator, or ESC-Configurator?","tried both, neither work"
Same error both times?,yep. betaflight can't read/write to it either as i tried changing the dshot setting and it would revert on restart [How to flash firmware via Wi-Fi here](https://support.betafpv.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404231679129-How-to-Flash-Firmware-of-ELRS-RX-TX)
i don't feel like that would have anything to do with the esc?,"If that's the case, maybe the issue is Betaflight. Sounds like the problem could be with BF Passthrough but the old esc works fine, i can change the setting"
"AM32 support is relatively new. Try a clean flash to BF 4.5.1. Also, you are trying this while the battery is plugged in, right?","I guess I should have asked that first, but good"
do i need to update the configurator too or just flash new firmware? im on v10.10.0,"the drone still wont go into bind mode. going to try via wifi nowe the options chosen on instructions are an option for me Things change as time passes. You're going to need to extrapolate from incomplete firmware updated, still doesn't read. esc has been beeping twice every time it tries to read this whole time, not sure what that means yea none of that is working. i just watched a few videos about how to connect it through wifi. and im just getting error codes Hello wanted to switch to the Walksnail system and we installed the Walksnail Avatar HD PRO Kit but cannot connect it to the googles. (As soon as the battery is plugged in it gets very hot). and the LED lights up red permanently. After trying around a few times it started flashing green"
Have you updated both the goggles and the vtx to the latest versions?,the last thing ill try is hard soldering the fc to the esc. though i think it wont help
if you were to build on a frame with carbon guards like the following would you prefer to mount the fc and vtx on the top frame or bottom frame? Thank you,"You are correct 1000%. I got it down to 4v and was like welp just to be safe, let me also mince it and then put it all in a bag. No flames no spark Nice. Glad you got it sorted safely.. Just remember that the Li metal in there will react if it comes in contact with water. Good idea to bag it up. where the motors are, so on the top plate"
So I bought some 4s lihv batteries didn't really know they were until now and I'm just wondering if I need to worry at all? Google tells me there really no different then regular lipos and I shouldn't have any issues just wanted to confirm that's true,"Anybody got any recommendations for a good quality camera and vtx 100$ is max budget for both Caddx Ratel 2 and any VTX from RushFPV, or the flywoo HM850"
Thanks. Is the tank race 2 any good?. Any opinions on this stack,"ooh boiii. it's used as an example by the betaflight devs of how not to design a FC, if I recall correctly. the main issue is the OSD and the blackbox are wired ot the same pin so you can't use both at once also iirc the esc is prone to failure. at least get the v4 also diatone and skystars sell better stacks for similar prices Ima stick with the skystar I assume you want a 30x30 Really just depends on what frame I’m gonna get. I don’t really know just yet https://pyrodrone.com/collections/stacks/products/skystars-f4-f405-flight-controller-and-50a-ko50-blheli-s-esc-fly-tower-stack-30-5x30-5mm What’s the difference from what I can tell it's the same stack. except since pyrodrone has not been hit by a hurricane, it's in stock That picture is from like 4 months who’s. Ago Lemme check rq. My picture was from July oh, you wanted other stacks. why not that one Nooo. The sky stars is what I’m prob gonna end up getting. Just don’t know what frame yet. Any recommendations. 5in none I know of. take your pick, basically. I've not really looked into 5"" frames Do I need to buy a new board or will it be fine should be able to just use a different 5v pad, there are several of them, tie the wires down at the end next time"
what happened?. what solder and iron are you using?,it wasnt the solder iron it was me i tried cutting something and cut that instead. Oh okay thank you
Hey so I have an issue with my analoge camera... for some reason it's got a super red color hue. It's the second camera with that issue (runcam phoenix 2 SE). I thought the first one was damaged from factory. But I just bought another one and same thing. Any ideas on what could it be?,yo whats range for vr03 betafpv goggles and vr02 and ev800d
Mhh. Is there a way to troubleshoot?. The range seems fine,"most likely a vtx issue if its the second one are you manually setting the channel I can get 1km no issue. Yeah, I have it on R8. I'm checking right now if on the goggles im on that channel. yep, r8 also on goggles. It is the one with the strongest signal"
that's far from the norm lol. have you ruled out your goggles doing it?. matched NTSC/PAL settings?,NTSC PAL no.. let me check. TBH I'm a bit suspicious with the goggles VRX
do you have a different vtx to try it with?,"I've had some issues with a tiny whoop, but again.. that whoop has had a rough life haha. Just an old set of box goggles... the betafpv ones... from like 4 years ago yeah. My other goggles are de dji 2. Drone is on NTSC. Lemme check goggles. It transmits ok in PAL or NTSC. But I'm gonna try it out during the day, right now I don't see any difference. I might be able to get some Skyzone Cobra S.... I'll do some tests tomorrow. My other issue is with an old drone that I have, which I'm trying to update to ELRS. The RX connects to my TX, but it's not sending anything in betaflight. Already checked the mixes on the model, all good. And I hooked everything as though it were CRSF"
"hello guys, sorry to ask again, but I'm flying with my dji neo and an rcn3 controller, and I would like to know if it's possible to increase the field of view... anyone knows ?",A set of mini tap and die. Rethread the holes to half a metric size larger and file the mount holes out on the drone underwater (keep the carbon dust contained and stops it fuxxing your lungs) Fpv depends on the camera. Fov*. U can't really change the camera
"really ? I saw some drones were able to, avata 2 I think, but maybe I hope to much from a neo ahah. and you know if it's possible to disable the video stabilisation ?","I think you can change a lot in the app. I'm not sure tho, I don't own the neo"
for the fov or stabilisation ?,"No, the angle at wich the camera is pointed up or down"
but is it possible to disable horizon balancing ?,"well nope, this is not a problem, I just would like the horizon not be banlanced. ok, no problem, thanks for your help"
"What are you powering it with, and which WS VTx are we talking about?","Good Morning everyone. waving from Houston, Texas. I ordered this , my question is when it comes in, will I be able to just PLUG in the avatar walksnail (so I don't have to solder. or am I suppose to solder it on For newbie otger than betaflight what software should I be getting Elrs configurator is the only other you would need at first, the others just come in when you need them I'd much rather just PLUG the vtx in You can only avoid soldering so long in this hobby.  Get a Pinecil (from the official website, they're cheap AF) and get to practicing :yellow_heart: I hear you, HOWEVER. for ONCE i'd like to just plug her in F405 HD happymodel. 2"". V3"
What are you literally powering it with? 2s? 4s?,"I can solder, I'm just saying I DON""T WANT to this one time. 2s Yes, you can plug it in. You might have to repin the connector though. I was able to just plug into pavopro, why couldn't I do that with a different board like F405 HD Depends on the pinout. It might not be the same. Im ok with repinning, I did that with the pavopro and it hasn't blown up yet. ohhh It might, but I don't know that for sure. oh ok. seems like every dang thing is focused on. DJI    stuff. and I have a walksnail Personally, I'd be stripping all the sockets off and desoldering their pins to save the weight. I don't care about weight. well under 250 On a 2s 2"", you should. Every gram is extra flight time at that size, same as a tiny whoop. Need to practice soldering tho, getting those socket pins off without breaking stuff can be tricksy.  Take the plastic off first, carefully and slowly, with pointy nose pliers ideally. Then take pins off one at a time. on the pavo 20 pro. they sent vtx with the wires just barely hanging on. so I have to resolder them. I WAS gonna sent it back because I'm so tires of stuff breaking so easy. I'm sure lots is my fault but alot isn't too. I think I got more broken drones/ esc's   walksnail    than I do working ones. learning curve I guess. but     DAUUUUMMMMMM  its getting expensive. someone should open a drone flying school to learn how to fly,     cause I suck at it..... LOL. I may have to sell my 5"" speedybee because its to powerful for me,  This most I can do is hover a little. I'm afraid of it and my back yard isn't big enough for such a drone, I'm gonna stick with 2"" and 3"" keep it. there will be a time when you're ready and then you'll be glad to have a 5"". also go to more open spaces that yellow one is the one that is to powerful. Yea, I guess I'll keep it for a little while longer. I'm sure there is a way to make it less powerful but I can't find that sweet spot for nothing, I don't want to get my head cut off (or someone elses) Set a throttle limit of 70% That should only be a temporary fix until you're more comfortable keeping it in the air yea because the way it is now, is WAY to sensitive (scary). I was just unsure what to change to make it not so responsive to my touch. I even have a gps on it but haven't used it yet because I'm just a beginner and went over my head with this 5"" You can also reduce the stick rates to make it turn more slowly"
"I already spent time inside   all simulators. oh really ?. well sh*t, I didn't know that.. I just got 5"" blades and didn't even think about props, other than I needed 5"". I'm not interested in doing  loops and stuff, I just want to fly slow and low ...LOL. I have so much to learn.","Well there are plenty of lower pitched props you could get, the ethix p3/p3.5 or gemfan 5226/5125 come to mind for some good low pitched props It will quite significantly tame it if you already have higher pitched props, and once you want more power, just put higher pitched props on. And you could also mess around throttle expo and stick rates until you get the new props can you tell by looking at the picture above (the yellow drone)      if its got that kind of props on it already Give me a better picture of this part of the prop and I should"
what radios are compatible with betaflight. and does the literadio 2se work. on betaflight?,"Radios don’t talk to Betaflight, that’s not how that works Well that's fairly high pitched This is one of the best approaches you can take. Much lower pitch props will give you more control for less top end speed. ok, I will order different props and try that"
Also the Lite Radio is terrible. What are you trying to do? What do you actually need?,"Can i use the walksnail 1s vtx with just a 5v pad for power. Bcs ill be running 3s Depends, you might overload the 5v rail doing that. Get a standalone BEC. OMG,    cyberFluke, Your so smart. They're cheap AF and tiny.. No, just old.. ""Experienced"" if you were being diplomatic :KEKw: Second what cyberfluke said, get a separate 5V regulator. Matek makes some that are pretty nice. If you need ultra tiny ones I might need to look on Mouser for a recommendation"
I've used the real cheap I flight ones a lot and they have been solid. Very small.  https://newbeedrone.com/products/iflight-2-8s-micro-bec-5v-12v-x3?srsltid=AfmBOopuVtb2xfMi6BfAYXKjSgm3jbtaVDbLNxxalWQFnLNyQ-RnVJo0,Idk why but i have it. In a drawer Saved your arse tho. Good find. :face_with_tears_of_joy: i dont even know what brand it is. I think i used it to power an action cam. At some point
Is this one to big for 3s 2.5inch?,"I have one very similar powering the 1s v3 in my 2.5"" SillyWhoop (I would just re do the soldering) Ofc, that was done with a woodburning tool:face_with_tears_of_joy:. Im not kidding. I used that shit for a year Not bad, all things considered :KEKw: Yeah it's just to make the joints prettier Use less solder save 0.00000001 gram weight. I will use a 25gram frame though:KEKw: Well, you can save a couple milligrams if you don't use too much solder (which doesn't exactly matter on anything heavier than a sub10g whoop) These ones are nice too, pretty much the same as the Matek ones. They’re about the size of my thumbnail Tru. It think imma use this 1 bcs of budget though. The whole build will cost me a like 130. Bcs i had some parts"
Anyway to tell what this is?  Someone flying above our retreat party. Been in the air at least 10 mins. Mini 2. I found em,"shoot it down and then use google lens Just hammer it back into shape, that's what I do every time I have a bent shaft, and since the only other solution is replacing it, you can't really do any further damage"
but how do i know where to hammer?. i can see the problem but i cant find it,"You look at it from the side, spin it around, look very closely for when it's bending over to one side, then hammer it lightly (with one of those rubber head hammers, not a metal hammer you will wreck it), and repeat until you can't see any bending anymore Threw an apple at it. Landed in this pool :PepeHypers:"
do you guys think i can use a 5000mah 2s lion battery on a boxer?. insted of the 6200 one,I don’t see why it wouldn’t work So long as it fits inside the tray
how do i get all 4 escs to show up in the osd?,"Hota D6 pro, or Hota P6 or T6 or toolkitrc m6d plus a usbc power supply and a usbc to xt60 cable if you have a high power ""normal"" charger, you can use that with the correct cable and an M6D. cheap and very good. also comes in cool colors. I think you can also do the same with the T6. but it might be single channel not sure"
is that corrossion???,How do I solder these weird castilated pads. The ones you would attach a battery lead too why does your solder... look like that Because it’s my first solder job ever can you send an image with flash on This is the first practice board I used. Am scated. Scared So how do I solder them. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) i wanted to see the solder points. with flash. lol Your gonna make fun of me no i am genuinely worried about how dark those joints are. never seen that Oh. They all have too much solder. They look normal irl. Wait wrong joints @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) this is what you get for posting peoples solder in diwhy :KEKdisgust: i don't do any of the fun making though Yes it’s prolly corrosion. Man fuck this i literally had to fucking take the people who were pinging them and judging them and put them in their play pen
what flux and what solder?,The ones you told me too buy
what have I done then :loudly_crying_face:. wtf is that???. i ain't ever told anyone to buy THAT,"well that sucks. do you have isopropyl Ah it was jason. Bruh it works wtf. What’s wrong with it. The lighting is just weird do you have isopropyl because if you don't you can't be using this stuff i dunno what's up with that solder but it looks extremely dark but it ""works"". that flux is NOT no-clean so it will corrode the crap out of your board. so if you do use it, clean it with isopropyl immediately So send me a pyrodrone link and I’ll order more. Also my solder is rosin core"
Also it says no clean. Wait so after I’m done just wipe with isopropyl?,yeah. i dunno if it's actually corrosive. but it is leaving behind some nasty stuff. so I has a dark blotch. It*. Lemme try wiping it off with iso toothbrush + ipa. scrub till shiny or close enough. enjoy
It dissapears. So just after I’m completely done I’ll scrub it off. Is 70% ok?,you solder pracace board shouldnt do that
I just scrubbed with a qtip and ipa. Only on the central ojes. Not the bottom left. So is my solder gear fucked?,Besides the dogshit tinning of course i've just never seen solder that dark. try soldering the bigger pads How do I solder the U ones same as the small ones. only now it'll seep through the hole. to the other side too Do I put the wire in the dimple. So confused maybe reflecting the black pcb surface How would I add the cap just. solder. one. rest comes later that's what I'm thinking lol show it from the side Yes I know they are bad
no most of those are fine. just maybe not enough heat if you want perfection(?),"Lemme try the weird u ones. Alrighty. 439C. 430C* uuuh. you shouldn't really need to be any higher than 350 on these Damn. wtf. It’s fine. Lemme try the weird u one. First one was a fail the second one looks decent dunno if that's enough solder. but also, try fixing the first one with flux and more solder Eating popcorn. Popcorn over solder racism. I’ll finish tmr. Actually nah I’ll keep practicing today. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet)"
"~~For the VTX do i really need to use two of the pwm slots to power it or can i use one? idk why this diagram uses two of them~~ i figured it out, the the pins are like the elrs pwm, horizontal not vertical. nothing weird about that, just gives you more room to work with. why not just go above the vtx antenna?",lol. stick a tinned wire in there with a bunch of flux Anyone know what this black bit is near the tx pad goop. silicone probably probably to hold something in place How should I go about soldering it. I might honestly just use the plug Bruh it all fllowed to the bottom. Alrighty I meant like every pad. They are weirdly big. Its like maybe a little larger or the same size of the motor solder pads That could have gone better. The third one is actually kinda good. I learned from my mistakes looks ok to me. the other option would be to resolder it so that the leads get routed through those two slots behind the velcro thats where the battery goes
what frame is that?. why cant you route the battery's lead above the battery? I feel that its gonna get zucced into the props,https://cncdrones.com/babymod-truex-35in-fpv-frame.html#mz-expanded-view-830641208908. doesnt reach this way. way too long this way. im thinking about soldering on shorter wires if it were me id make the cable shorter. yeah and wires that havent been eaten by props in the past issue is i have no silicone wire so id have to use this idk what that is. sounds like u need to go shopping tho home depot 18 gauge wire. moneynt
"lol, the solid copper stuff?",do what u gotta do lol. i stopped buying fpv gear and my bank has skyrocketed this should work for now. until i solder on that new wire if it wasnt so dark id go flying rn. but someone decided that 12:35am is dark How is your  city so light polluted sometimes and like that others all depends on how i choose to portay it Don’t question how I remember that check this shit. wow nice job focusing there camera. there we go Bruh what the fuck is that bullshit. That cant be from 12 nightshot makes the sky look super bright Not as bad. Well no kidding again it all depends on how i wish to portray the sky Thwts just a long exposure shot yeah. if i wanted i could make it look like daytime right now I kinda wanna try that but don’t wanna turn on pc. I have a fucking 10 year old camera. Lemme get a photo My bad. Is it worth leering photography on it or do I just need a new one no i mean my camera is 15yrs old youch them pixels. dats bad. less then ideal some would say Mine was relewsed in 2008*
If I get a radio master pocket for my air65 I understand that I need the elrs version but does the region matter ?,Sx10 powershot. Wdym the region if your in europe you want LBT if your in the US you want FCC Ah. What’s the difference LBT limits power and bands to stay within European laws buying direct from radiomaster will take a while to ship. so what country
probably around 300. as a kit? or using a choice of parts?,"this Skystar H7 HD:  https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-skystarsH7.html  how can i control the camera output on a dual camera setup, do i need dual vtx or uhh what. perplexity.ai said i need a camera switcher... what is a good beginner rc plane build one urself, lot of fun. whats ur budget btw choice of parts is much more fun because you can buy a ton of random stuff get it working and upgrade, whilst with a kit ur typically stuck to A) either a specifc brand or series of parts B) uses some sort of proprietary control technology. prebuilts also have this issue. if you do get a kit make sure majority of the parts, especially the fc system can be modified easily. I personally recommend choice of parts, it gives you faaar more freedom than a kit will ever give you and it provides you with a better understanding of how it works, not to mention you can probably reuse the parts for an rc car or fpv drone down the line. for example an rc plane I had two months ago is now a killer rc car. i took it to a race and got first place + fastest lap. and its all rc plane parts. if you want me to give you the best choices for rc planes come to dms ill explain detailedly Where's the cheapest place I could buy the pocket radio in canada yea, just get a drone motor + drone esc + receiver + lipo battery, it cost well under 200 usd for me"
why does the esc configurator fail to read 3 out of 4 escs?,test the esc with voltmeter or sm. what esc is this and which fc. specifics pls the crazyf411. its a aio
as in inbuilt esc as well?,yes. had to turn my radio off :PepeDent: works fine now. not a clue
Hey will this blow my house up?. https://pyrodrone.com/collections/chargers-1/products/isdt-q6-nano-battgo-200w-8a-1-6s-smart-charger,odd. you know its a bad idea when you start with that
whats the command i should run when updating betaflight. diff all?,"i asked here because i dont want to ask a ai It's actually not odd and is a very common issue with aios where esc configurator can't read the escs if the aio is binded to a radio. I don't know why exactly that happens, but most aios with the Rx integrated will have this issue while i dont personally havent used aios yet, this hasnt happened to any of my 5 or so friends who have"
Do they use aios with integrated Rx ?,"most of the aios they used were f405 v4, barring one. hm interesting Afaik it only happens to aios with the Rx integrated wierd. good to know tks ok so bluejay has flashed fine and i can read back all the settings and it plays the startup tone however when i arm or try to spin up the motors in betaflight nothing happens. its a bassline with the X12 5-IN-1"
Are you designing a frame ?,"Flywoo's batteries suck Also I'm assuming you are talking about the nanohawk that's a 65mm whoop, not the nanohawk X, for any 65mm you would want some folded 300mah batteries, refer to https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250 for the brands. If you are talking about the X (the 3"" toothpick) then same thing but you want the 450/550mah version yeap u got it right Nanohawk 65, yea doesn't get me much fly time, sorry foe not referring the model Well, the main issue is probably just that emax's batteries are crap and they must sag like crazy so you aren't getting the full capacity out of them whats the suggested arm thickness for 4"" Like 4mm, but the overhaul arm/frame design is also important You could probably get away with 3.5mm if it's a unibody, but at 4"" I wouldn't really bother with a unibody I saw this frame by sanchez and he seem to run it with a 2.5mm frame with a unibody Oh, yeah if it's a toothpick the requirements are different, I assumed a more school bus frame. With a toothpick 2.5mm is fine"
would it handle punchouts fine?,"I still would go with actual interchangeable arms, fpv cycles has a 4"" version of the tp3. I would worry more about crashes"
so no vibration noise but weak on impact?,"But yeah it should, assuming you use a not stupid power train"
1404 3800kv?. or even 4600kv,"That should work fine on 3s, I might go up to a 1504 motor tho"
the frame is unusual it doesnt really look like a toothpick but is pretty light. more or less. i can send a basic assembly for you to judge?,Well for lr 1404 will be fine. If you want to. Funky
ik. but i need to accomodate hardware for ardupilot for missions if needed. any suggestions/critiques?,You could remove these if you wanted to shave weight
frame only:. that rear bit is only intended for gps and antenna mounts. Do you think itll still hold strong without those bits?,"Yeah. Just use t700, not t300, and you could make the whole frame a bit slimmer"
based off my previous frame which works great buts its a freestyle quad.. what could I go down to. 5?,"Idk exactly how thick, but I would take some inspiration from the explorer lr4"
its not a uniframe would it still handle fine?. I assumed the 2 plates holding it would dissipate noise,"Probably, but a first design is never perfect, you will end up making some iterations anyway, so I would recommend you start by pushing it a bit then thicken a touch if needed, but I reckon for lr it should be fine"
I cant find anything about how thick they are. Ill try a laser cut prototype of 5 and then hone from there i guess. even with heavy loads? The thing I am worried about is it snapping too easily on impact. I want to maintin at least some rigidity. also any suggestion on the battery strap/mounting. The to slots are based off my previous frame which works great but I cant tell if itll work for toothpicks,"Hey yall I was wondering what drone I should go with I’m a starter and I found a dji mavric  pro for 350 and it comes with 2 battery’s on Facebook or should I go with the dji mini 2se and also any comments on the base/vtx placement Yeah it's not going to be very impact resistant with thin arms. Especially with an o3 onboard. But it shouldn't explode mid flight so for lr that's all the durability you really need ye that should be fine. It flies through pretty tight spaces as well so as long as a few bracnhes wont hurt ill keep as is You can use rubber bands between the arms like most toothpicks use, or just go with a 3d printed friction mount for the batteries, a well designed one can be really light ye I have seen a few I was going to mount the battery on the bottom but I was told that a top mounted lipo is better for handling. Plus Id rather not have a it scraping the floor with all the equipment on it And I would remove the bottom carbon plate and standoffs, it will save a bunch of weight too"
and hold the vtx how?. just screwed in?,"Top mount doesn't really give better handling, it's more preference based, a lot of people love bottom mount a lot love top mount, we mainly use it for Freestyle so it doesn't get the impact head on in a crash. Yeah"
no realy benefit in lr then?,"Not really. Just depends on the frame designs really at would it be ok landing directly on the vtx If you don't land in wet stuff or crash/land hard it will be fine is there enough room for an optionl LI ION pack would you say. 3s or 4s. maybe even 2s You should be able to fit an 18650 pack in toilet tank, shouldn't be too hard to model a rectangle of the same size as a *n*s 18650 pack"
wow ok. Good point I will try it.. also prop clearance. pretty tight or should work?. that or the arms are made longer,If it doesn't hit it doesn't hit
# Jumper T15 or Boxer Crush?,"I would make the arms like a couple milimeters longer just in case to account for manufacturing tolerances. And prop stretching is not really significant at the speed we spin them at # PERSONAL PREFERENCE so even if it flew theroretically at 100% it wouldnt hit ideally # I would say boxer crush because you get nicer gimbals, and I don't really care about a big screen, depends on how much you value it # MAKING THE TEXT BIG IS ANNOYING. # WHY idk what one to get! I'm gonna order today but I think I'm gonna get crush # so you are 101% sure people see your message just found iut how to do. it lmao # I'LL MAKE SURE TO IGNORE IT THEN It shouldn't. # too late yea this is what I'm thinking only gomma use screen one time im.used to old screens also takes alot of battery rather have nice gimbles # but ill make it longer just in case"
boxer crush it is? heard that jumper is bad quality too my brothers controller just snapped on the gimbles it's the gamepad type jumper,"i have ran tlite since it came out and I have had 0 issues brothers gimbles just snapped completely while flying controller kinda creaky too Radiomaster does have a better track record, some jumper models have very stupid things going on, but lately I think they've been doing better They used to have a bad QC, but it's gotten pretty good now. But not as flawless as RM"
stick to radiomaster because they never had no quality issues? trying to.get best controller i can get so i don't gotta upgrade ever again. think his controller breaking was a quality control issue with the mould seams,"I don't really care about having damping on the camera, but if you want it sure boxer is pretty good, mine has crappy ghosting on the screen sometimes and the barrel wheel feels pretty shitty when navigating the menus but besides that its alright They used to be a little spotty but now there isn't really any issue with jumper's quality I am either a really bad frame designer or my 3d prints are shit cause every frame I have designed O3 mounts for had the worst jitter"
Maybe you just aren't very good at tuning ?,"Never say never haha, for me radiomaster is the safer bet but the t15 does have some cool features. Either radio is a solid choice tbh. that's odd with the ghosting They just use pretty cheap LCD panels fun fact: I have never tuned a quad. BF defaults all the way. That and my fc doesnt have a blackbox only features it's got to me is the touch screen that's gonna use alot of battery and I'll use it 1 time and never again lmao"
Use presets ?. Plenty of them on BF. For basically every size,"ye i run supaflys PIDS. pretty good but doesnt always stick does anyone know how nice the boxer crush gimbles are I've used the tx16 stock gimbles and they feel nice I just want a quality radio. not sure if t15 gimbles can stack up to the boxer crush gimbles The crush gimbals are quite a bit better, but if you need the bigger screen, they aren't exactly essentials yea the screen to me is just gonna take alot of battery and there's really no need for it only gonna use it 1 time to set up quad. it is pretty cool though but idk if paying an extra £60 is worth it for the boxer crush Then I would get the crush, more battery and better gimbals. Personally, I would, but that's not something we can answer for you"
aint they supposed to be the best gimbles on the market currently? I see alot of people using boxer and noone using the t15,that's just because jumper is less popular. not because one or the other is a better radio the t15 gimbles don't look adjustable too compared to the boxer The ag01 are basically as good as it gets. They should be tho guess I get that then when I touched the stock tx16 gimbles it was so nice so satisfying. too smooth. maybe it's behind the gimbles they are but on the inside oh that's kinda annoying And the ag01 are even smoother and metal. It's the leather seat addon of radios
"Why are the ag01 gimbals so fucking expensive? Like, the price difference between the boxer and boxer crush is way less than the price of the gimbals","Partly Because the v4 gimbals aren't free They're CNC machined, use fancy hall gimbals and are literally put together the best possible I've got a losi 5t that's got alotnof cnc stuff on it. it's very sastifying to look at. yea I've made my mind im getting boxer crush. now to choose a colour white gets dirty too easy white is bland and boring Still better than black (like my boxer) https://tenor.com/view/kirbyy-gif-27456779 Black and white are just the vanilla flavors of objects, it's boring and everyone already did it The light or dark blue ones are also nice tho swear you can change it. like the casing You can, they have a transparent case too, and every crush case can be put on a normal boxer. It's the same mold but different color oh right another question does race launching your drone hurt it. I've just learnt it now I'm doing it all the time. it's too fun"
What do you call race launching ?,"where you tilt the drone before taking off Oh, no it doesn't, I also do it all the time with my micros I think it hurts the props if you touch the ground I have a little angled base on my desk for it But if not then it should be okay"
you can do.it with whoops?!!?. I put it on a uh forgot what it's called it's to stop people falling of decks,"gonna launch mode everything now But I don't make them tilt, I have a tilted base I like doing the tilting thing Yeah but they slip on my desk so I can't does anyone know how much force a frame undergoes on average during flight. or maximum force as in flexing force from the thrust. in N You can check the box in your osd tab and you can see how much you pull No but you could calculate the bending momentum by calculating the force that the motors generate how would I find out the said force from the motors Yea good question. There are probably some formulas which I don't know"
I'd just mount my drone to a Scale to find out how much thrust in grams the drone generates and the convert it into newton's but thats likely to be a bad idea. What's this program called?,"solidworks. simulationXpress Should work fine yeah so ive converted the max for the closest kv which is approx 338g. into N. which is 3.31. x4. 13.somthing No, not 13.something.  4 instances of 3.31N, one at each arm end, important distinction."
"I'm thinking about building a 7 inch or a 10 inch, I was curious what the cruising speeds would be for each quad, I wanna do car Chase stuff, so im looking for a high endurance with a cruising speed of like 50 to 60 mph? Does any one have a 7 inch or 10 inch that they could tell me there cruising speed like 50% throttle?","dunno if 50% could be considered cruising. but my 5 and 7"", with ca. 25º cam angle do ~50 and 70km/h at ~7 and 13A amazing. woah whats that"
"Remind me, what are we doing?","trying to figure out how to wire the avatar vtx. this also an exuse to clean my drone a bit Yellow is gray, if that makes sense."
"yea so the 9v pad is fine?. also there is a used port under that 9v and ground pad, is that okay?",Usually a 9v is supplied solely for VTxs to my knowledge.. I don't understand makes sense that used port is my old vtxs cable
On the other side of the board?,"yea on the bottom. same board just at the bottom okay, just gotta practice my soldering then The motor connections on some ESCs wrap around the edges, FC signal stuff doesn't, *usually*. how do i clean my boxer gimbals to be fair, the cable thats in that port wont be in use anymore, if i can get the glue they used off ill just plain get rid of it, same for the camera one i dont know. i can feel it. my yaw stick is so unsmooth. shit did i fuck my radio Yeah do that. Or, gently but firmly pull the port and the plug off the board and take the socket pins off after that. If you have no intention of using it. i wanna keep it on just in case, you never know Bit of grit in it most likely. would you say it might be smart to get someone to do the soldering for me if im not confident is it cleanable. practice boards i think they sell replacement gimbles. so there is a way of getting it out Give it a wiggle, see if you can dislodge it. But yes, it's an absolute bitch to take the gimbals apart, but it *can* be done. thats extremly annoying This. Very very this. will it damage it if i leave it Soldering is a skill you **need** in this hobby. Not likely, not any more than a potential cosmetic defect if it leaves a scratch somewhere visible.. Sweet. another question. have you messed with your giombal tension Keep food, sand, and shit like that away from radio. :yellow_heart:. Yep ive tried so hard. dang ok. they scare me. i might leave it I have mine set to very loose. They *only just* centre. The throttle is set loose AF too. alrighty. can prolly leave mine. just feel like the left stick yaw is slightly looser then right stick roll. it bugs me. then for some reason my throttle dosent center. /s It's very much personal preference. Try both extremes to see which repulses you more. That'll tell you which end of the scale you want to be playing at. this is crazy. i working on it ok what is that diagram even of It's a stress test result. Of a 3d printed frame.. Never gonna end well. its not 3d printed. its t300 carbon Oh lawd.. Needs thicker carbon. its 3mm thick with 7mm wide arms We moved on from that design 6 years ago.. They flutter badly. what would you call that style 2016, and they called you Deeper, narrower arms will work better for the same mass. its pretty much a toothpick frame with some bits to mount hardware Still. Thicker carbon, narrower arms. Yea I was just guesstimating what it felt like on my 5 inch"
so 4mm with 5mm wide arms?,"horizontally wide arms are really great in resisting force and vibrations in the horizontal axis... which the quad basically never experiences lol Yeah, run the test on that and watch the difference.. It'll flutter less, but more importantly, it'll resonate at a higher frequency, which makes it easier to filter out of the inertial data.. There's a good reason modern frames have **thicc** arms that are well mated to light, stiff fuselage boxes."
"but a lot of 4"" toothpick run 2.5mm thick arms and they seems to fly fine?. ill still run the test","Betaflight is doing **all** the work to make that happen.  If you're going from scratch, you can do better, and not skimp for the sake of 50c per unit. the skimping is on the weight. I need maximum endurance carrying lots of weight. Hence trying to aim for a light frame consider a tubular frame Hi I have a darwin fpv baby ape v2. the vtx recently went out and im looking for a new one any recomendations for a new one. or should i just go with the stock one.btw im on a budget so looking for something ""cheap ish""."
so if i run same config at 3mm thick frame but run 5mm wide arms it will have same flight performance. like iflight?,"One vertical, one horizontal. becuase thats worked well before haha i thought you meant like this"
"Which is stiffer?. They weigh about the same, right?. The thicker will be heavier by a gnat's thinking about how this oe is built",thicker frame with thinner arms is 5g heavier at........ which is 5.5g heavier. with t300. not sure if t700 will be much heavier or lighter
"20% heavier, but noticeably stiffer, if I'm reading these charts right?",T700 should be quite a bit stiffer and let you make it lighter with the same overhaul stiffness
is the 5.5g a real problem to lose to a stronger frame?,it can handle stresses much better but I am unsure if the extra stiffness is needed since the control variable is running with force of 1N applied to all those points. Which seems excessive to what a motor would really provide. I spoke with @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) and he agreed that a weaker frame isnt an issue since im not freestyling it.. The main thing is i dont want to lose endurance by a large factor over imprioved strength I was about to ask if you'd factored in the multiplication of that when you manoeuvre.. but I do see your point if I am mounting much heavier equipment and flying the unit as a whole
"I mean, is it an option to try both?","both as in 3mm thick and 4mm thick frames. could prototype both A stiffer frame will mean sharper response too, don't forget."
but if I am coming back to my earlier question in terms of the quad having not horizontal forces to deal with if i run same config at 3mm thick frame but run 5mm wide arms it will have same flight performance?,"The more it flexes, the more wallowy it'll fly. How much variation you'll get from the two I can't say though.. Not tested things like this, to this degree first hand. Think just like a car chassis.. Stiff, solid frame brings a sharper, more predictable response. You won't make a perfect product on the first try, so just try something then iterate from it I really want to run a thicker frame but I have a feeling that 5.5g is going to come back and bite me later on. Especially since I have other things to mount on it. If it was a 5"" id do it but 4"" is making me uneasy"
@cyberFluke your opinion is thicker frame with slimmer arms is better?. even if im running LR,"Yeah.. Vibration might bite you in the arse. Personally, I would just use the lighter frame, if it's for lr, who cares about if the vibrations are 10% lower if you aren't going to freestyle it, worse case scenario I'm wrong and you just change the design a bit and you will be able to learn from it That's definately an option. Suck it and see.. Don't **know** if you don't try it. I want to go 3mm but after speaking here im not feeling great so im going to make both and see what works. is trying 3mm thick 7mm wide still an option or should i just run 3mm thick and 4mm thick with 5mm wide across both becuase it saves 3g just making the arms slimmer I would only do the slimmer arms with 2 different thickness the 7mm is wasted mass. for no real gain in performance. ok this is great to know then And if the thinner one works well, I would then do another one that is 2.5mm, and eventually make the arms slimmer since it's just about making the frame lighter without fucking the resonance, durability isn't a big deal here ok. this is mass with 3mm carbon. so nearly 7 grams lighter with 1mm less thick frame Also, the tp3 uses super slim 3mm arms and has really great resonance, so you still have a lot of material that you can strip away use the R and T pads right by the 9v and ground pad. no need to have your RX and TX on the other size (Those are the 4"" arms) hmm ill see when i get the set i didnt think about the fact that the real load is vertical not horizontal but if I am correct the the width still plays a role in stiffness and bending moment. since cross sectional area goes up. but since direction of force is up then it may just be better to run slimmer arms U1 is usually used for the RX. U3 for VTx. No need to have to change everything. ive used R# and T# for all my stuff and it works fine Yeah, but I'm mainly saying that even 3mm with your slimmer arms could use even slimmer arms and still perform well not sure what U is meant for but i just dont see the point of not grouping the wires together Yep, you can use whatever, but to keep with convention, and so make config changes less likely...."
so i could go even lower than what I am at now and it could perform well?,"U is shorthand for UART. You could make them narrower whatever # by the T/R pad is the UART you use would the fact that its not a uniframe play a role in better performance since its held by 2 plates .... This isn't my first rodeo. Yup, but also it's a freestyle frame compared to you an lr frame well its mine and its going well But the only way to know for sure what works is, well, a couple of prototypes meaning 4"" with 3mm wide still ticks the box as a good freestyle frame im just saying i have my ELRS receiver soldered on T2 and R2 and set UART 2 to serial rx and it works without issue meaning itll works even better as a LR Yes.. It will.. @Wooper Trooper (I HATE JST)   However, AFAIK, this is on something that's been configured before, using the connectors, rather than solder connection. Those connectors are configured to certain UART pairs. To prevent the user having to change a functional configuration, I gave them the instructions I did. Meaning it will also work for lr"
"ok thats great. I will try to run simulations on all of these thickness and then get some cut. I still think that some weight can be shaved. Do you agree that this isnt the best frame design and that it is very ""2016"". From the looks of it it will do its job fine and the extra bits coming out are perfect to mount the O3, camera and other sensors.?","The arm dimensions are the ""2016"" bit. Thin and wide is what was done a decade ago. We've learned better since then. That was what we meant by that. :red_heart: Well, it is a fairly utilitarian frame design, but if it works it works And I would still recommend you remove the arrow shaped pieces at the front and rear cause they aren't particularly needed and will save some weight so thicker and thinner is better"
they wont snap on impact? I wanted to add a bit more rigitdity. And some surface area to mount things. I thought just having the camera mount area without supports would make the frame a bit less rigid,"Well, I don't see how removing those would reduce significantly the durability of the frame, especially since the carbon is nicely aligned with the main supports so the centre beam and the 2 angled one eitherside. leaving the bit that joins them I would remove the center beam, the two angled ones *and* the bit that links the center beam to the two others, maybe just make this area a tad bit thicker (on both sides of the frame). Thicker this way a bit crude but like this Yeah. At the camera mount too both front and back like this. would they still be as strong without the supporting beams. also i made the camera mount bits longer. by 2mm And I would shift this one a bit so the carbon aligns"
closer to the moter mounts?,"They shouldn't be noticeably weaker To shift the angle at which the beam comes out of the arm so it comes out at 90° so the carbon aligns. Yeah pretty much I would do the same at the camera mount So the carbon aligns, it makes it much stronger as the fiber will be what holds it instead of mainly the epoxy. Also, if you wanted to you could shave off some extra weight on the motor mounts by making them a 2 hole mount like this (it's still plenty durable, lots of frames do this, and I owned the frame in the picture and the motor mounting held strong for almost a year) ye I have seen these but Id rather have 4 screws for redundancy than have 1 fail on me. Its happened before Yeah, it's annoying when you break a thread on the motor cause then you need a new motor or a new frame just because of it ye exactly. Plus ill be carrying lots of high value equipment so thats one place I dont want to skimp on. Especially with my experiance in the past. I cant calculate the fillets as quick. but basically crude. didnt shave much That is pretty high on the bad idea-o-meter stray hole ill fix that. however. at 4mm thick. we are back to THE SAME WEIGHT AS BEFORE!!!!!!!. lets go. finally. but still 5g more sorry 6 and somthing more. compared the the 7g and something more before. but 5g lighter on average. i feel like its lost some character Well it's a lot blockier now true ill need to fillet them Fillet makes everything nicer It indeed is, and most of the bending seems to be here, so if you round the corners here you should be able to make it significantly stiffer. (Tho I think it would be a good idea to keep in mind that all of this data is being interpreted without any reference frame and we are only using the up torsion, so for all I know this could be best in class stiffness since there isn't much to compare it to) ye good point I cannot actually compare anything to it And also this is only evaluating the bending/strain of the model when at full throttle assuming there is no vibrations at all, it isn't a simulation of the resonance. Quite a lot better already It's in mm*10^-3 not in mm ye good point. either way its smaller Yeah, but I think weight savings should be more of a concern right now than the strain at full throttle. Or doing some kind of resonance simulation if you know how to interpret it (or run one) Making it a bit lighter should be more important than trying to make it flex a tiny bit less when at full throttle at this stage is there anything else to do. also this is the before one with same thickness and width Making the arms a little slimmer and experimenting with different thickness hey guys i cant find the com port can u help\ And if you have time to spare you could also carve in  where there is carbon that isn't essential Well, once you are happy with it, just do a pla mock-up to check if you got the dimensions right then there isn't much else to do then sending it to the CNC and seeing if it flies like crap or not would acrylic help. i can get it laser cut So long as it is accurate. (Tho don't try to fly an acrylic frame) ye thats fine. So only test thickness not arm width unless im going thinner than 5. i learnt that the hard way many years ago. i can test stiffness relative to each other"
"Yeah, I would recommend you try some thinner arms, I'm sure there is still plenty of carbon you can shave and still have it fly well. What size was the quad ?","it was a 3"" but it was a predesigned one i found online. So i thought I could get away with flying it with PLA since at the time i think chris rosser made a lr that was fully printed. safe to say it didnt edn well. also turns out fillets add a lot of mass so 4mm is 26g and 3mm is 19g with current design Well, I know Dave_C did a 3d printed nanoLR frame (which was pretty good for a printed frame) didn't know rosser also did a printed frame why cant i find the com port on betafpv config actually it might be dave_c now that i think about it. old frame is 3g heavier at same weight and how do i update my literadio 2se's firware on beat flight It's heavier at the same weight sorry old frame is heavier by 3g at same thickness. my brain is evaporating from all of these simulations"
does the Radiomaster TX16S LED Gimbal Surround fit the boxer crush?,"Yes, they use the same gimbals thanks now if it was your radio would you go for the white lights on blue lights. the radio colour is blue. iceberg blue. I feel like blue would be too kuch. much* I would go for neither if it was my radio, I don't care for LEDs. But probably blue the blue looks a little darker than the actual radio. ill have to look at some vids"
Long or regular battery? I noticed that long type battery is lighter https://www.gaoneng.shop/products/gaoneng-gnb-lihv-6s-22.8v-850mah-120c-xt30-connector-lipo-battery https://www.gaoneng.shop/products/gaoneng-gnb-lihv-6s-22.8v-850mah-60c-xt30-lipo-battery-long-type,"ight thanks, didnt know which to go for with pcbs these are entirely different grade cells. the 60c ones suck. get the 120c ones"
Why don't you just screw it in ?,"Double sided tape, zip ties, just as the people on reddit said"
guys is it possible that my motors are blocked to throttle above 60%?. and if one of my motors looks like that is it smart to do a filter tune now? or should i buy a new bell and then do it,"Move it around the holes until it kind of falls in place and screw it in place. Transmitting and receiving, they are needed. Solder the RX pad to the TX pad on your flight controller and TX to RX Yea, those are the rx and TX pins, but on the side there are t and R pins. Those"
Can I just use any 5.8 whip antenna with my dji o3 unit (if I want a compacter/lighter build than the standard antenna)?,"You *can*, but understand that there is a gain-loss when using linear antennas and circular polarized antennas together. I do not know which the DJI goggles come with"
"Hi guys, could you help me fix my drone please. I took my drone for flight for the first time (it was actually my first build and also flying). As one would expect, I crashed few times, and after the last one, 2 motors didnt start spinning. So I took it home to test it in betaflight. None of the motors spin and I cannot get a video from my camera. I thought it would be just poor connection between FC and ESC (I have speedybee stack), but this wasnt the issue. I also tried to connect it to ESC - Configurator, and none of the four ESCs showed up. Do you have any advice, what should I check? Any help appreciated, thanks","I'm using the dji integra, so these have linear and patch antenna Should be just fine then Ok cool gonna try how it affects my range"
Did you do all of this bench-testing with a lipo plugged in? You need lipo power to power the ESCs and generally to power the VTX as well. They cannot be powered over USB.. The *only* exception is for 1S whoops,"Oh, I didnt realize that. I know that somehow dameged the connection between FC and battery, because when I tried plugging it in via shortsaver, nothing happened, so I guess the issue is gonna be there."
"Soo i cannot boot into my FC anymore. It only works if i flash with betaflight and do not disconnect after flashing. If i connect and reconnect, its in boot mode again. I feel like i might have damaged this button with the metal screw and measured 11kOhm resistance between the pads where the arrows point to. Do you think this is the issue? I dont want to remove the button before im not certain also please ignore my questionable soldering lol","It is possible that because of how wobbly the motor is, when you go over 60% the other motors are basically just trying to counter the vibrations instead of simply spinning faster Need to see the actual log to provide a decent answer, a noise chart means very little without context You should really redo your soldering cause that's prime #diwhy content right here If it's always going into boot mode when you re-boot it, then yea, I'd say the button is damaged and needs to be removed will do, i just did not have proper equipment at this point in time. well i guess here goes nothing. lets see. ok this did not work :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: idk what else to try tho"
you got the button removed from the board?,"yes. So again quick recap: 1) Starting does not make the blue light flash(means FC is not running) 2) I have access to DFU Stm32 bootloader 3) If i flash, it will tell me its successful and the blue LED blinks. I can then connect to the FC via dev/ttyACM0 and also change settings etc. 4) If i then restart the FC(by unplugging and plugging) the blue LED is off again and I can only access the bootloader. I then can repeat the process I removed the button for loading into the bootloader because I damaged it externally. I don't think it was broken tho because it still does not boot the FC"
Have you verified with your multimeter that there is not any continuity now on the boot button pads?. Could you provide a little more context?,"I have a quick question could I swap out this cam, it uses this connector not sure what voltage it is but I can test that It's a Vivitar Aeroview, but the board seems to indicate it could theoretically be replaced with a different camera that uses the same voltage This is not like standard hobby-grade drones where parts are designed to be swappable, you have an unknown camera here integrated into a custom IC. There is no drop-in replacement Uhhh maybe. Measure the output voltage. Its probably not gonna be hard to find a analog cam that takes the voltage you have.  But the 4 wire thing and it being label tx and rx on the board is very uncommon, and may be an oddball to get the wiring sorted.   It's not unheard of for a analog FPV cam to be 4 wired, but the wiring color and pad label standard is different than you have here. May be doable but will likely involve a lot of guess/check. It looks like the board also integrates the wifi broadcast antenna to stream the video. It isn't an analog camera, it's a wifi AIO on a cheap toy"
"Hi guys, so my antenna with extention are gone because of an tree branch. What extention cable do I need? Can't find it. My old antenna was like the second picture","I have absolutely no idea MMCX is the connector on that VTX. You can either get a MMCX antenna. Or a MMCX to XYZ pigtail and then the relevant XYZ antenna.   Either way I'd reccomend you find a way to re mount the VTX such that the MMCX connector on it is better protected. Also you'll have to remove the broken MMCX pin from the pigtail that's stuck in your VTX connector. Ah check, thank you so much!"
did you follow the instructions?. specifically the ones outlined in the orange and red warning boxes,so im setting up my radio master booxer for the first time in express elrs  i got everthing ready and started the config  but it seems to be stuck on veryiging build system and downloading firmware but im seeing no network useage  or progress from it any help or advice screenshots. and how are you trying to flash it im just stuck here cant interact with anything and through  elrs passthough. ment edge tx passthough
"Quick question: does bat on my fc mean battery voltage? Because my VTX takes 7-24 or something volts, and there is a 9v pin too",yes. it's better to use 9V
Or should I use a TX pad?,"@The GGManiack lol. the SBUS pad should act like a normal RX pad when not used for SBUS, you don't need to re-map PPM"
ok quick question. do you have a battery plugged in?,"hopefully  last question im doing setsup stuff and seem to have everything binded the only issue is my drone wont arm or spin rotors even in betaflight you need the battery. *a charged battery. also, it won't arm when connected to Betaflight Configurator expected really. but yes, you need a battery the usb is not powering the the motors SBUS pad just works like a normal RX pad. The commands you saw are for converting the PPM pad to a SOFTSERIAL_TX, but the commands may have changed in recent BF make sure the cable is not touching the motor"
Hi guys I just made a new build but I only had 3escs working. Now the number of escs detected has dropped to 1. What is going on? I've triple checked my soldering. I didn't even change anything physically when the number of escs went from 3 to2 then eventually 1.. Matek f722se board. Separate escs,make sure the plug is seated well. oh. why. show i guess It's just what I have. Everything is conformal coated so I don't think some random solder ball got into something
"Are they all getting power, signal, and booting properly?","Yes, and used to be 3 getting detected and making booting noise. Now only esc1. I have a ts80p ungrounded. Do u think the soldering iron zapped it @shamgod that's just how these are I don't understand what you're trying to say old crappy indiv ESCs just die. whenever they feel like But I just bought them:loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:. They are brand new hm. try to re-solder them I immediately conformaled them too so there's no dust or short on them Littlebee ESCs used to be pretty reliable (in 2016!), not sure if new ones still are"
I did:smiling_face_with_tear: and that dropped me from 2 escs detected to 1. Do u guys have grounded soldering irons?,nah. the ESC should handle a little static zap Like most things can handle a ts80p I've never had issues before the iron shouldn't be an issue. do a visual check on everything Esc configurator says error reading esc 2 and 3
What firmware is on them?,Blheli s. Esc4 not even detected at all
How did you validate that they are all getting power?,"I like pain :skull:. I don't know. Most were working before. I can multimeter it rn Do that, and also verify that each of them is beeping when you plug in a battery They are not. Only some Well, not getting any power would explain why they're not working. testing with 3s lipo. 11.4 on each esc. only esc1 is beeping on boot"
Are you making like a nostalgia build?,i also cannot stand ewaste
Power on the leads for the rest?,yea. 11.4v. polarity is def correct. checked a billion times at each stage of building
i could but thats seems like so much work for a 4$ esc. is there no other way to debug motor connection issues?,"LOL if these are authentic escs then the odds are pretty good they've been sitting around longer than your flight controller was If they aren't authentic then they are very likely very cheap clones I should know, I still have a build from 2016 that has little bee escs on it i have spare FC and ESC but i already cut my motor wires short for this stupid nostalgia build :loudly_crying_face:. what if this is the FC having an issue or a mismapping in betaflight for what those pads do I wouldn't consider that as likely. But it is matek so who knows that's fair but i feel like ewaste is really only a huge problem when it involves plastic and lithium i have 2 entire spare stacks. id like this to work tho pls It’s just not worth it though Just start trying things and debugging more yes i am isolating each rn remove the cap, see if it's the fc by wiring in another. stuff like that gonna try different escs on sensor 1. see if its ESC or FC I mean you could try getting them to work but from what i’ve heard individual esc’s are just bad I know they are. Im going to put hours into building this. and then absoltuely crash it. and it will be spectacular You see now that is a great idea Here for the love of building :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: Welp got everything  connected imma have to stop here for today and figure out why it's turning in a circle and disarming itself tomorrow ig https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146/1144570522991067146 Stupid answer but are your gimbals calibrated Ill check in the morning about to take a nap before work"
"ngl im kinda sad this isn't the standard anymore, what's the advantage of 4 in 1s besides compactness?","Possible, examine your escs to see if they are the same as his they are the same escs, i haven't checked if they have a cold joint at the power driver yet cuz i needed a break from the drone But i think unstable power delivery to the logic circuit makes sense for the symtoms i've seen I mean if they show the same poor soldering yea just compactness and weight Less complicated to build, less weight, narrower arms for better aerodynamics, they are less complicated to built on the 4in1s. these seperate escs take SO MUCH soldering. like x5 the amount of soldering Not to mention having to break out all the pads on the flight controller so you can solder each of the signal wires and the corresponding ground wires. The flight controllers are simpler to design and pin out as a result. And individual escs need a pdb or harness. With the exception of a few flight controllers like the one that you're working with now but it doesn't cost me 80$ to blow an esc :crying_face: conformal everything right out of the box and you'll never blow anything again That's actually the opposite of how that works a good chunk of the time"
wow really?. why. wet grass has killed more of mine than conformal,"Informal coating insulates the electronics further reducing the amount of heat they can dissipate with air flow pffft fk heat. water the real opp i blew my first one up because a prop got caught in a blanket was trying to be ""safe"" testing my first build lol how do the words ""safe"" and ""testing"" relate to putting a blanket in your prop :face_with_tears_of_joy: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: i put a blanket down so it wouldn't hit the floor hard oh wow this is actually a very understandable and relatable context lol :skull:"
what version is on either?,"3.x on both, I cant remember the exact verisons"
Do you have model matching on?,not on the tx. idk if its a thing on rx
get a fan with a carbon filter. or just a defuser? idk what its called. these things,"flows easily. well and at a lower heat iirc. 63/37 is the sweet spot.

How do I update my drivers?. Everything I see online relates to DJI camera drones,"Im trying to flash Beta flight 4.5 but whenever I try it says ""failed to open USB Port"" There is not a single point in this log where your throttle stick goes above 60% From the log it just doesn't look like you're using all of your throttle stick"
Have you used the ImpulseRC Driver Fixer?,"Forgot about that tool, it fixed them and now im able to flash. thank you"
does this big power converter chip look light it has a cold solder joint?. as this person said was the issue,it's not very well in focus. hard to say
"Just flew my quad for the first time and I definitely don't regret getting into this hobby, but how do you clean everything? My quad is full with grass and dirt",IPA and an old toothbrush. and just go scrubbing Alright thanks. I guess even drones have to brush their teeth sometimes plant gunk is inevitable
"If I have ev800Ds, what else do I need to convert an rc car to have a camera feed. Is it just a camera and vtx?","Look up a ""stack saver"".  Just a bit of elastic stitched together into a loop, but racers use the idea to keep the majority of the cack off the stack.. Yep i've heard about it, i'll just print something similar for now, if i  still have this problem i'll buy one Hand stitch a few, cheap AF."
guys should I install bluejay instead of blheli_s?,your radio or esc doesn't sound calibrated if its flying away at arm. check in betaflight under reciever tab if everything is reading out okay does this big bottom pad look bad. i kinda dont see any solder on it
what changes will I have to make in betaflight?. after flashing. nice,"none. esc configurator .com I'll look for a jb tutorial u just open ur drone in escconfigurator.com with the battery plugged in. click ""read settigns"". then ""flash all"" to flash all of them with bluejay. leave everything else default if you dont know what ur doing, it will be just fine for u The ""minumum"" spec of 40W ensures that whatever power supply you use is able to provide enough power to charge all channels at the max rate. That does not mean necessarily that it cannot operate on lower wattage."
...*Maybe*? You can always check continuity between the leg and the pad. Assuming you are deft enough with a multimeter,i am. but its conformaled. so i gotta cook through it first. might as well add sodler and see if it gets fixed
"Yea, remind me why you did that again?","everything reads good, and radio is fine it workd perfectly with my 3 inch"
Why wouldn't I conformal coat an ESC that was already heat-shrinked and protected?,"bc thats not enough protection. i put the heatshrink back on after I guess if you're landing in ponds so its double protected. i am going to full send this through snow banks I flew independent ESC quads in all weather, never had an issue with water ingress on the ESCs. Conformalling the FC was worth it though. Anyway, I digress yea FC for sure. i just had such a good experience with conformalling the FC that i try to do it to everything now"
"weird question, where do you put the battery strap on a standard 5 inch frame? no spot seems good since its either really close to the props or doesnt hold the battery in the middle","The top plate typically has slots through which one would thread the strap not on this frame ig, it has cutouts but they seem mostly aesthetic because none of the straps i have can fit through them and theyre not square lol"

Well don't trap the wires and you'll be alright. Where do you think the wires are on other frames?,"idk, seems like a bad design to me though better would be to have cutouts like a belt buckle so the strap can run on top instead of through it If you run it on top of the plate then you cannot add a battery pad like Ummagrip. That would also transfer forces keeping the battery strap in place into the very small areas near the ends of the cutouts, instead of around the main body of the plate I have cutouts but still run the strap under it. Else the pad isnt really doing anything"
"anyone help you yet?. its fine, higher voltages arc from further away. youll usually hear the pop on 6s","some very high voltage devices have spark arrestor circuits for that but its not a big deal for 6s on xt60s Kind of, am trying to figure out how to connect it with receiver.

"i mean... edventually, maybe? its not enough to have anyone worried and it happens to all high voltage things, but thats why they have spark arrestors for the 14s skateboards and stuff","a ntc (or was it ptc) could help with that (the resistor that is less resistant with more heat, ptc i think), but I'm too lazy to resolder the xt60 cable"

ok. and do i flash the latest version?,My charger keeps overcharging my batteries. Toolkit RC M8S charger and I have the end voltage set to 4.35 for my hv batteries but it just charges till 4.45 and then freaks out and I have to manually stop it. And my 6s liion it stops .1 volt per cell under too OK I GOT IT!. Now what do I do do the same on the whoop. but using betaflight passthrough https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/receivers/betafpv2400/ if i flash the receiver tho I wont lose the tune right. I saw something about not flashing betaflight. I guess thats seperate when you flash betaflight you take a backup of your tune
ok. so i plug in my drone and follow this?,this should already be done right
this one right?. i looked on the website it says this,"it should be `BETAFPV 2.4GHz AIO RX` uh oh. I flashed with lite and it says sucess they're both practically the same just reflash it with the aio one it's technically fine, but the AIO target is correct"
so what now. should I change it?,"it's just as quick to flash the other target I changed it. now what assuming you gave both devices the same bind phrase, then just power cycle the drone and radio, the radio should then show signs of being connected to the receiver"
how much would a rocket motor launch system extend the flight duration of a fixed wing aircraft?,"As long as the rocket burns+ whatever momentum it imparts on the craft to maintain min air speed.  So.... Not much, essentially just as long as the rocket will burn. Which there is long and slow burn rockets so its def dpenendant on the rocket u pick.  Rockets are for speed or acceleration, not for long duration or efficiency."
but isnt most of the energy needed to fly a drone just getting it up in the air esp for a long range fixed wing?,If you used a rocket to get in the air then a motor to stay up there. Then the rocket will just be dead weight and drag the whole flight.  TBH I don't have a good value to give you for what %% of total power a fixed wing craft takes for its take off. But I really don't think it's the majority of it.  You could certainly review this by watching some DVR from FPV planes on take off and note their voltages to give you more info on what power is used to get there. a rocket motor would totally freak out most PID loops. and probably rip apart a foam wing :KEKw:

"i have a plan that is reciving video feed on my pc with a uvc 5.8Ghz reciver (using rushfpv tinytank VTX and caddx ant nano CAM).

My question is then, will i get this data when I recive my video feed, ive seen that you have all this data in fpv goggels, do this come automaticly or is this some kind of setup or comes with the goggels?  Bc if I can get data straight from the video feed my problem is sovled, if not I need to think of something else...","unless you can read off the monitor, no you do not get telemetry in an analog video feed. the receiver is separately sending some of the data back, but this is for use and display by your handset, unsure if you can pass it on to your computer mavlink can do that. expresslrs can do that over bluetooth and wifi (and probably trainerport) Two common systems can provide you extra information you are asking for. But it is all very hardware dependent on how it works. So pick what you actually need 1st. Then look into how to make it happen.  You can get a lot if not all info over video (depending on the video systems you use.) As well as get a lot of nifty information back to the radio via telemetry. So really, pick what is important for your use case and then go down the path to get it on the screen u want. yeah I was about to say this sounds like a thing you'd use mavlink for the data can be really anything, i dont rly need it... I just need to show someone that I can do it. so literally anything. school project...... :loudly_crying_face: :water_pistol:  and plastic frame........ Yeah ur fine then and stock off the shelf betaflight or Inav OSD will be plenty for your use case. INAV or Ardupilot, and mavlink"
"what part of my drone is sending the data, suppose the FC dosent do that?. while its in the air ofcourse","your reciever, usually Plastic frame is the real :warning: here. is this hard to setup. iknow.... in the older days, a separate telemetry radio but now the reciever can do it thinking of using inav no clue, never done it, probably best to ask in the inav discord okay! thanks alot, really helpful!! given it's one of the basic things you'd do, it can't be too hard i would strongly suggest you use ardupilot instead. the inav discord is also a special kind of place"
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) did you do anything special when you spray painted your frame?. Or can I just spray paint and let dry,depends on how long you want it to last right. if you spray paint it on without any prep it'll chip easier and some people very much like that. if you sand it **UNDERWATER WITH PPE ON** and then spray paint it it'll last long. double so if you spray it with primer first
Did you put some protectice coat?. Protective*,"I had a mask on just in case any of it did get airborne, and waterproof gloves I say ""I"" but I mean my SO. oh like that. i didn't. i just sanded it. and then spray painted it. you do want polycarbonite paint Yeah like mask and gloves i got Tamiya paint but there's tons of choice Need to make sure my paint is that if rc cars are at all a thing in your country you can probably find Tamiya paint too"
I just got some spray paint from a random store. By hand right? Or did you use a sanding tool?,just by hand. automotive sandpaper of varying roughness You can also do the oldschool edge carbon painting really EZ for some extra flair. Brush on color with oil based sharpie marker. Then seal it in place with super glue. Lasts essentially as long as the carbon frame does but is super EZ to make look nice and is fast to apply. (totally knew what sandpaper i needed and did NOT go to the hardware store and just grabbed 1 of literally each kind on the shelf)
How much did you sand it? Like just quick sand or did you go to town on it?,"tried to get every single little nook with varying roughness. the really annoying thing was that the screws would take paint with it. and i wonder if i had done a better job/primed it it would've stayed on better The painter for this prize quad last weekend was Bobby harmon. He def has some tips to share and is a humble guy if u hit him up. Very cool, but I suck at art. So like. I will just spray random lines. Abstract"
"Am i trippin, or is there only 1 motor wire?","They r pinched and stacked as one inside the little 3d print.. Look at where they exit the print and enter the frame and u will see the 3 wires Ah i see, interesting :batman_hmm: I love such perfect colour matching quads but It'd be to much work for me. Well, in the end I won't see it when flying NGL green is a color that straight up should not exist and never even be used in hobby drones ever. Brown and black are both fighting for 2nd place of color that I hate to use.  Just makes stuff unnecessarily hard to find when lost in a crash. Fuck thoose colors for drone parts. IMO.. Maybe military drones need cammo. But hobby drones need reverse cammo. Naaah brown ist 1st. Just an ugly colour. Green can look cool at least. Something like purple is probably one of the best if you want a nice drone that you will find after crashing When PPL loose a drone at a fly event and PPL ask its color. If they say green/brown/black. I'll straight up not help. U guys go do it. Nah, I'm out. I'll ensure the gear and our flight line is safe and protected.. https://tenor.com/view/tom-cruise-help-me-help-you-jerry-maguire-gif-9201387. Fuck colors that blend in well."
"Is it so common that people have trouble to find their drones?. If I have the dvr and a beeper + beacon, how can I not find it?","Products like the vifly finder series or the drone keeper or the hellgate buzzer exist for a reason.. Camo colored quad lost on a hillside:. https://tenor.com/view/south-park-its-gone-gif-4104229. Depends where you live and fly. I've had plenty times where even a working loud AF beeper was useless. Due to other nearby noise such as a road, river, waterfall, concert or what have you."
is there an option in betaflight to change the rates using buttons on the controller? doesnt seem to be in the modes tab,weird question could i put a walksnail HD kit V2 into a darwin fpv baby ape II freestyle ok i think i found it
its cheap and if something breaks ima jsut replace it witht he other stuff if I need it. And what do you propreity stuff?. examples?,"Can you get a cable that imitates a 2s JST LiPo, so like you can just plug into usb DarwinFPV motors do not use the standard mount size, so you cannot just replace their crappy motors with better ones off the shelf *Mount* size, not stator size. Most motors in that size class use a 9x9mm pattern, Darwin is 8x8 (iirc) You can always do some Dremel action if you really want to keep their frame (tho wear adequate breathing protection if you don't want lung cancer)"

They must have changed it with a new motor. It did *not* used to be 9x9 yeah look im jsut gonna get the baby ape 2 put in my own elrs and then sell a kidney for the walksnail L and the Walksnail Avatar HD Kit V2 That said, you'll have a heck of a time fitting a walksnail VTX into that frame. Looks like the stack is 20x20 mount, same size as a WS VTX, and there is not a lot of room in the trunk Like can I get anything to trick a vtx system into running off a usb power bank the mounts are bothe 20x20 I will jsut stack it on top if not there is a load of space in the back and i have a 3d printer and allot of time Depends on the USB power bank But what is the adapter that would work for usb to JST but not for charging *Depends on the USB power bank*. *aka which USB power bank do you have* What about running it off wall power"
"Running what off ""wall power""?",God forbid we be specific here. It's not like a specific adapter to a specific VTX will require knowing the specific power source used I think it was just the cheap $2 AliExpress specials that they built a quad around
Good lord..... TF are they?. Are they *brushed* motors?,"I think they're knockoff DJI Mini motors. Very cheap Chinese brushless motors Yeah, fair enough. Sounds about right for the fail rate."
Just from a spec standpoint the [BetaFPV 5-in-1 Air AIO FC](https://betafpv.com/products/air-brushless-flight-controller?variant=41142912745606) is looking pretty good,"i want to get a set of 1102 22000KV for my cetus pro should i get 37 mm or 50 mm wire length Uhhh. Yes. The props are 40mm in diameter so imagine the wires being about that size You can always remove wire easily, adding more wire is harder Well yeah but 37mm is probably already more than enough whats the best aio for whoops for 50$. with elrs and vtx Is a simulator like ""Liftoff"" actually accurate to the real thing or is it completely different it's enough to learn everything you need about flying an FPV drone in acro mode it's not completely realistic, but definitely enough to learn on :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:. What is the difference between this. When i select ""elrs"" it gets more expensive"

Do I have to do anything once I get a iflight nazgul xl5 eco?. Like in beta flight?,"Cheaper in the short run too, if you're new to the game.. The** only **reason anyone would buy anything else as a newbie, is misinformation. yes it will need some user setup"
If I build my own FPV drone will DJI goggles and controller be compatible?,"Technically, yes, but I would **highly** recommend getting a proper radio to replace the DJI controller."
"ok cool, you think the goggles are fine tho? they just look cool lmao","yes, but getting very expensive goggles just because they look cool and not the actual performance they offer is not a great idea hi i have  a problem with a frsky r-xsr and a mamba f405 mk2. i can't get a signal between my radio and / the fc."
what betaflight firmware version?,"Go to the CLI tab in Betaflight Configurator and click `Submit Support Data`, then send the resulting ID here. just the support ID, not everything around it aaa sry. 477bd3fe-6b91-473c-97b4-4f6db3f0a4f7"
"alright, I assume the receiver runs F.Port firmware?",i tink so. i got it to work with with thes setting like a week ago with anotuher  fc
how do you have the receiver wired up?,"There is no good way to wire up F.PORT on the FuryF4OSD *just saying* @Vitroid well, idk about the newer versions actually up to the MK2 it just wasn't feasible. you could only do it without telemetry, running it as if it was just SBUS. BF considers F.PORT to be an non-inverted protocol, unlike SBUS btw @Vitroid what should I change first to get better range my 200mw darwin fpv baby ape vtx my betafpv vr03 goggles or the antenna on the goggles or > darwin fpv baby ape ok I am mostly kidding. but that thing has an abysmal reputation :face_with_tears_of_joy: is. ok. i was going to ask if i generally had a bad reputation it's a guarantee at this point"
What antenna have you got on the goggles?,the linear ones it came with. one
the babyape seems to come with a linear antenna too.... before we get to hardware tho. are you sure that your goggles are set to the exact same frequency as your VTX is transmitting at?,"when iwas building my drone litterally no vtxs were in stock it was horrible Welcome to FPV. If you want something, it's probably out of stock. yeah i have it manually inputted in betaflight. litterally everything is in stock now thougth but i dont have money now :loudly_crying_face: yeah guess what'll happen once you have money. I can almost guarantee it they wont be in stock exactly my experience. anyway. 200mW isn't a lot but it's also not extremely low. I would consider switching to better antennas no bdut in all seriousnes i canm probably get one noe its just i dint really want to since if you upgrade the VTX, the antennas will go anyway (unless you enjoy wasting power or money) I can send you a pictur soon this is the one im considering rn looks good. https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/chaosfpv-vtx-v2-video-transmitter-25-1200mw-2-6s-vtx-telemetry-mmcx-sma/ that's ancient. and wait. you said babyape that thing is like 3x too large for the babyape lol a good quality 400-800mW VTX is better than a crapy 1200mW VTX and that ^. https://tenor.com/view/wow-this-is-garbage-you-actually-like-this-gru-margo-gif-16561237 i dont own a baby ape i just ahve one of their vtxs. https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/darwinfpv-5-8ghz-25-200mw-vtx-for-baby-ape/. this you did not make that clear at all lmao ok lets say i wanna spend something like £30 max what do you recommend well you're going to need antennas anyway. so start with antennas i dont want crazy rnage btw just solid reliability im not planing to go further that 700m I know that VTX far too well I mean, it will get you that ....... https://tenor.com/view/doubt-press-x-la-noire-meme-x-button-gif-19259237 Can't say it'll go much further though ok all jokes aside i undestand its shit so whats better :PepeShrug: I had an AKK Infinite out about 2.5 miles at one point. That's all I ever got though Yeah that's def a reberanded AKK. yeah ik some people made AKK shit work. I never could See if you can find something acceptable from RushFPV, that'd be a good place to start is this good. https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/axisflying-smurfs-vtx-1-6w/ trying to stuff power through a tiny linear antenna will not end well. so make sure to invest in antennas I had OK luck with AKK, but I only ever got their clearance VTX'S for 5$. So I never really gave a shit to replace them like props. Out of the AKKs that didn't break too fast to test, my X2P decided to be a flying EMP. when cranked to max power, I was the only one with any video left on any channel :face_with_tears_of_joy:. specs look okay, no clue about actual quality. the connector is a bit iffy you'd have to be uber careful with antenna mounting. because that shit will rip of. > Crank it up to 1600mW and broadcast like a pro—**just don’t forget the antenna, or you’ll fry it faster than you can say “Papa Smurf.**”. jesus christ who wrote that it's probably quite literally just luck. and nothing else To this day I find it incredibly funny that my VTX luck was IRC Tramp > Unify pro32 nano >>>> Unify Race HV's > AKK X2's that broke in two crashes > Assorted array of random eachine shit > AKK X2P that somehow lived long enough to be hated"
"whats the best kind of antenna. for the average person. polarised ,omni?","for the drone, for analog, most people nowadays use some form of a RHCP lollipop Yeah that was the real downside and cost of cheap AKK's. The X2P is the only VTX that was removed from my drone while still *technically functional* https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/foxeer-lollipop-4-plus-fpv-antenna-2pc/. ok hows that. btw thats one for my drone and goglwes. right well this is a set of 2 identical antennas. and you need a different connector for the goggles. so no unless you buy it 2x. if you want 2 (to have a spare for the drone). then that is a good choice well they only sellt hem in 2s well it's not the only antenna they sell so i mean ill get a spare"
what connector is on your goggles?,"also whats the disadvantage to ufl tiny fiddly connector that can rip off quite easily i think sma rp or whatever. the other sma RP-SMA or SMA. find out https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/product/truerc-core-5-8-fpv-antenna/ ok i need to get the same polarisation right cool. should i get an ufl to sma addapter for the vtx. or is it not eoth it. worth adapters add bulk and lose signal what the diffrence between left and right polarisdation. ok i wint then. wont literally just the direction in which the radio wave ""rotates"""
whats thwe piont oif making diffrent types the ?,"a RHCP antenna rejects LHCP signal and vice-versa. when a signal reflects, its polarisation flips. RHCP reflected from a metal wall or whatever becomes LHCP. so the antenna rejects it easily. also xHCP is orientation independent, unlike linear ok. picking between left and right polaristation is hjarder than i thought ngl Most analog stuff is RHCP. like, if antennas are included ok. oh yheah shoulf i get it is ufl then because i might get a new vtx soon maybe RHCP is convention for analog FPV systems, LHCP is convention for digital also that looks like its gonna break. does the tube help ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. you have to figure out some way of mounting it. and preventing it from yanking on the ufl connector orrrr you could look around other shops for a rush VTX (or whatever else) with a MMCX connector which is much less likely to depart the drone The thicker stalk is semi-rigid, so you can just bend it whichever way. Antennas that don't have the thicker jacket are floppy and need the antenna bit at the top to be cradled https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/rushfpv-tank-ii-ultimate-vtx. yes i found one. is that one good then would you say Yea it's pretty good, the iflight one you linked before is pretty good too, but overkill for the distance you want yeah. ok but concidering the price gap is 6 quid. does that make the jump worth it"
do you have space for a 30x30 VTX?,"what is the max ranbge do you recon ill get for the normally I'd be recommending this one https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/rushfpv-tank-mini-vtx cause fitting 30x30 is kind of a royal pain Yea what frame is this going on yeah so the  30x30 is definitely off the table lol. it has space for 20x20 in the rear. and the main 30x30 stack space is too short for a 3rd board. well, unless you get hella creative... so you want either the Rush Mini or the Smurf i meabn tis is 28x20. 28x28 the mounting pattern on it is 20x20. which is the pattern that the S1 V5 has in the rear. it has more space there, but not 30x30 mounting pattern space ok. wait where would i het the screw ro mount it thought For the Rush Mini, make sure to get a 90° MMCX. not a straight one. right angle. screws are sometimes included with the electronics. sometimes not. it's kinda expected that you bought a screw kit of some sort the rush mini ill ahve to solder wires on myself right ill neeed a nut tougth right. hbecause the souce one doesent have threads#. oin the mounting frames It does come with some hardware, but not a lot since it comes with an antenna.... you could theoretically buy it and just solve your signal issue with power :face_with_tears_of_joy: Included: - RushFPV Tank Mini VTX - Accessories (Linear Antenna, Cables, Plastic Cover). it doesent comw with mount screws i dont think idk. these are the pics I find online ok ill take my chance then. do you know where i can find it table for betaflight bet it's in presets already. sure is ok you think i should get it then] Their VTXs seem to be solid. never seen much issues with them Rush has a pretty good reputation for sure. ok i bought it. now i cant buy any antenas but hey im sure its go the range i need now] who knows. this shit is always a lottery suprisingly i think i actually had one of these go out on me. i couldnt figure out if it was the antenna connector that broke or if it just went kaput but it was acting really weird. it worked great for a few years lol"
"is the qx7 access or accst. iirc the qx7s is access only?. which means that the rxsr needs access firmware. start there. it needs to be plugged into the port on the bottom of the qx7s iirc for a firmware update, assuming it has access firmware available. i have a qx7 accst so i kinda know my way around the x7s but I have not ever done access",it says xtd. i got it to work like 1 week ago. but then i needed to switch fc. and now its not working aigen
has the reciever worked with it before?,yes :slightly_smiling_face:
"ahh. if you power up the reciever, are the LEDs the same when the qx7 is on versus off?. the LEDs on the rxsr","no first red blinking then green when i start the radio then they are connected. which is good. the issue is with your FC and RX connection. send some pics of how they are wired @Ettan5. once we know theyre wired right, we check the betaflight setup, and thats it.. im looking at the wiring diagram online 1 sec. thats a mamba mk2 that looks right to me"
yaa right. can i screenshare in vc?,sure. @Ettan5 i think my internet went out lol. Im on my phone aaa. sad. im in reciver Loose ethernet cable i fixed it. Ill be back in a sec
"@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) im in vc with @Ettan5 and this is really weird. the wiring is correct for the rxsr, its bound, betaflight has the correct port, and sbus is selected, yet there is no response in the rx tab. what else could it be?. wait i have a theory","check sbus inversion. check if it's a weird uart that doesn't support. all that it is a weird uart. betaflight can change the pads inversion automatically. the rxsr gives out inverted fport. and i think the fc is making the pad uninverted. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) using the set serialrx_inverted command didnt seem to fix it tho. so idk. ```The parameter sbus_inversion has been changed into serialrx_inverted, and the way it is applied has been changed as follows: It now applies to all RX protocols, not just SBus, and instead of switching the UART to normal when off and inverted when on, 'off' now means that the port is set to whatever the default is for the selected protocol (i.e. inverted for SBus, not inverted for SUMD), and 'on' means that the port is inverted from default (i.e. not inverted for SBus, inverted for SUMD).  ```. apparently fport straight up doesnt work on that fc. we gave up, didnt have the connector to flash the rx, elrs stuff is getting ordered lol"
"Hey guys, after a flight, should i leave my lipos drained or should i charge them up again?","average frsky experience it really wasnt ever hard for me to flash my xm+ rxs, i just made a 3 wire servo connector extension lead and let it rest in the rx holes. but if you dont have those connectors sitting around youre screwed. also i only ever used accst and i will not speak to access Up to storage voltage Thx. Hey uh guys is this normal. My charger sounds like its about to take off. And its getting louder"
that thing is... new?,"Oh noooo. First one motor was not working know both haven't even flown it all parts brand new beside the motors and frame (Johnny 240 5in) Yep. Where thinking bad motors. I also just put new electronics in it besides motors, and reaciver. Sense I landed in snow crashed from 50ft up I thinks. I successfully was able to hit a power wire and destroy the other battery and the one after that form hitting the ground to hard and it blow up somewhat"
"Hey guys, i lost that rubber plate that holds the battery in place, it it a necessity? Or do the straps hold the battery well enough. Im about to do a maiden flight after a big crash","Ah man that’s what I had tried, might be something else. I’ll look at that, thank you!"
"So, yes. Get something to prop the battery up above the screws, otherwise they'll tear into it. How do you even lose the pad though?",It should be stuck on pretty well with adhesive. How do you rip that off https://tenor.com/view/suicide-kms-gif-4481206 I completely understand your frustration. Back to the workshop!
If it is the first time I’m flashing the firmware (new drone) should I still take backup?,lmfao. this is the best kind of fail - completely harmless.. and very very funny
Have you already done some setup in Betaflight?,"No. Sky stars 20*20 stack Flashing without a backup is fine then yeah that's all fine, skystars doesn't f* around with targets This is the funniest shit I've seen here this week :KEKPoint:"
"Well, it's not good. What are you trying to do?","Setting up beta flight things. Right now click on the connect so the apply custom defaults button is coming up, but that is not working Custom defaults aren't a thing anymore"
did it flash successfully?,I do not know. When I did click on flash it did instantly finish. No progress bar at all
there would be a green bar saying success. are you on windows?,I’m using a MacBook Air HM. That's not the usual culprit My Linux laptop did not want to start beta flight https://app.betaflight.com/. try this in a chrome-ish browser
"Hmm, no progress is happening at all really. It just says Initiating reboot to bootloader…. Is that normal?",well it is the normal issue.... *on windows*
is there a moving progress bar?,"Wouldn't that damage it it's not flashing.. apparently, MacOS cna have issues with USB re-enumeration. and the FC switches from USB VCP to USB DFU when it reboots to bootloader so, might be worth while to retry with the boot button which puts it in the bootloader from the start (no reboot needed) If that easier. I do not find any one. When setting up the ports does skystars have an image how it should look. I did not have any gps so I did skip that. But what should I choose for the vtx, I have tbs unify pro32 hv.. Tbs unify pro32 hv has smartaudio, but I did remove that cable."
I do not need that I think. It have no way to go really. But would not the vtx work without it?,>  but I did remove that cable.. put it back then
?? I can't make heads or tails of what you're doing. SmartAudio is used to control the VTX settings from BF. Generally it's trivial to wire up. (literally one wire),to the TX pad of any free UART. there's TX6 right in line with where the VTX wires up Oh okay then I have it. Sorry then you set VTX (TBS SmartAudio) on UART6
"Hey all! I’m thinking of getting a crux3. I want to record my flights, what’s the best way to do so?",A common method I saw was to use the insta360 go2 but it costs twice as much as the actual drone lol
"What goggles do you have? (plan to have?). Yes, one in each category. Except for the rates","What does serial and spi mean. And what does the alternatives for the voltage mean SPI ELRS receivers work by having the main chip running Betaflight also control the RF circuitry for the receiver, serial works by having a complete ELRS receiver. How the voltage gets reported back"
"Okay, I do not really know what I should chose, I have a elrs dual happy model receiver. How do I know that?","Then it's a complete ELRS receiver. It's up to you. If you want to see the total voltage or the average voltage per cell Brand new. I bought the radiomaster pocket and have been practicing in the sim. Now I’m looking to actual buy a drone and a headset Okay. I'd recommend the Skyzone Cobra X, they have DVR"
"My original thought was the crux3 1s elrs with the EV800D. But would like to have decent recordings, nothing crazy. Awesome! Thank you. @Vitroid just to clarify though, there is still going to be quite a bit of noise in the recording. If I want a decent recording with no noise, I assume I have to install a go pro or a small camera in addition to the default onboard live feed camera correct?","You could get an onboard DVR board. The Crux3 won't handle that much extra weight well Hm okay thank you, I will have to rethink my setup"
alright. did you set the serial rx port up in betaflight?,"How do I connect my radiomaster pocket to betaflight. I think it is connected to my drone, then it isn’t replay saying that anything is wrong while trying bind in the lua script in my radiomaster pocket, but it isn’t saying that I works eaither how are you trying to bind it. and is it a SPI or Serial reciever Serial. With the bind option on the radiomaster pocket doesnt work like that. you need to flash the reciever. and the radio Did also change so the Rx and Tx has the same bind name alright. what versions of elrs are they ob do you see a C at the top right of the elrs lua script"
nothing happens in the reciever tab?. also send a picture of the reciever tab while youre at it,you should see the channels move when you move your sticks did you cross your RX and TX wires when wiring up the reciever to the flight controller alright send a picture of the ports tab I did check that like 10 times also left side of the reciever tab if you dont mind It did rest after I did save it i dont know what you meant by that All the things I did save did disappear. When I did save weird. i think betaflight does that when you mess something up. yeah just turn serial rx back on and see if it works Maybe it have something to do with the note. The first one yeah. so you prob turned something on you shouldnt have so it reset that page I do get a warning about the vtx It did just reset. Again try turning only serial rx on alright now you just need to find which one *doesnt* work It is when I’m selecting the vtx. (Tbs smart audio) Skystars stack. 20*20
Skystarsf7hdpro. Skystars f722 hd pro. Do I need to configure it with the vtx app first maybe?,not sure tbh maybe try a different uart. nah that wouldnt do this
Sure that I do not need to change crsf to smartaudio?,i dont know anything about tbs unifys. but you can try that yeah
what is not working correctly?,Like this:  +VTX to 7V-26V GND to GND VTX to Video TX6 to RX1 (SA). The ports will not save the VTX Then you're setting the Ports tab incorrectly.. Send a screenshot of what you're trying to save It's still necessary though
you're telling UART6 to be MSP and SmartAudio at the same time @wilmer. those two things are not compatible. why do you want MSP on UART6?,"Leave it at smartaudio The sky stars image on tabs says that I don't see how that is relevant. your VTX does SmartAudio. you just have to set UART6 to run SmartAudio Okay, so I should not enable the switch the switch tells BF to use UART6 for MSP communication. as far as I know, you haven't connected anything that does MSP to UART6..."
How do I know if I should use dshot600 or something else? In the description of the fc is says that it supports dshot 600,"Stick to DSHOT300 generally speaking. It's plenty fast enough in most cases. I believe it's the max speed when you have bidirectional DSHOT enabled anyway, which is ideal Okay, It says Kiss/BLHeli_32 but I use AM_32 AM32 is replacing BLHeli32, so it should work for you. The wording on the UI just hasn't been updated yet"
Do I need to click flash firmware to this esc on each motor in esc configuration. When I click on flash all ecs and click flash none of them I flashing. Should I use the am32.ca instead of ecs-configurator.com?,am32.ca can be very broken
"Okay, I stay with the other website then, but should I do this?. This is was happening when I click flash. Same happens when I try to flash each esc","i honestly can't read a single thing in that video. and I tried I’m sorry, here is a better picture of the first thing in the video"
yeah and you're selecting 2.16 no?. why would it flash it if it's already on that version?,"Yes. Oh, so you mean that it already flashed"
"i have some questions regarding the osd, hw can I access the esc telemetry for reading out the temperature for example? the esc sesnsor input is on port five, but on teh osd it always shows 0°. Also, how can I access information rendered by the goggles like the voltage?","If two of my motors is going in the wrong direction how do I change that it literally shows in your own video Okay, but how do I select I motor. Oh I dumb I needed to click on stop motors ok I found out my esc doesn't support telemetry, but I still don't know about the goggle info what esc. what goggles"
how would your flight controller know?,yeah thats part of the question. what do I have to do to transmit this to the fc/is it even possible there's a chance you could do it with expresslrs vrx backpack oh yes thats what I just read. probably the only way to transmit the data to the drone
how do i know if my air fc is v3.0 or v3.1?,or. you could go digital. instead of expensive analogg. lol if I go digital one day i'll just buy a walksnail vrx
would I just need an elrs backpack for the goggles or also something for the radio?,depends entirely on what you have. there is literally no v3 of that
there is no v3 of the air fc???. it should say on the expresslrs wiki pages but I assume the boxer has a backpack already. dunno about your vrx,"alr, will not be important for me soon but maybe I'll think about it one day. thanks there's only a v1.0 as far as I can tell. it literally just came out so I did add the modes to the drone, the beeper seems to work, but when enabling arm the motors do not start to spin"
what does it say on the OSD?,"I have tried every motor in Motors tab and it seems to work. What is the osd, and how do I see what is says"
you have goggles right?,"oh... that'll make this more fun. can you go into Betaflight and type `status` in the CLI. and show. can you show the motors tab There was a minor change to the 4in1 to fix the vtx, so there is a v1.1 of the 4in1"
do `status` in the CLI again. on the receiver tab. can you check if your transmitter throttle is actually the throttle channel?,you know. that would explain your motors not spinning when you arm it No. I have that off. I did remove the messages
"when you tried to arm it, did you unplug everything and then plug in a battery?",Yes. Btw did work know
"Guys quick question, I want to replug these antennas on my o3 air unit, I forgot where each connection goes, is there even an order or can I plug them anywhere?",doesnt matter. you can still see how the cables were bent originally btw
"i have a problem, i bought a drone e88 pro and i cant connect it with my phone to fpv camera, does anyone could help?","Oh no that's even less fpv than dji. I don't think much people here can help you with a phone drone. Here are mainly people that build their drones themselves or use systems like analog, walksnail or dji"
"if you need analog, walksnail, dji or other goggles depends on the video tansmitter. do you have a link?","depends on what you wanna do exactly. closest to your drone is flying cinematic https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 you have to be aware that drones fly completely different and you will need to practice in a simulator first @Rysiek Kind of a noob question but what is the difference between a 45A, F55A, and a F65A flight controller those don't sound like flight controllers 45A sounds like a 45 ampere esc. all of those sound like they have something to do with escs. and the difference between 45 and a 55 amp esc is that one can output up to 45A per motor and the other one 55 Hey what goggles would I need to work with a metor 65 or a mobula 6 elrs alr. elrs just means you need an elrs controller So would my beta fpv goggles work with it then for the drone. where you wanna buy it. usually there are multiple versions of bnf drones. there could be an analog and a digital version of the drone I will check. Unmanned tech betafpv is (crappy) analog, so you need to make sure the drone works with elrs radios and analog goggles Oh OK. How do ik if it works with analog goggles it says it has an openvtx in it. that is analog i think"
How many watts usb type c I need for hota t6?,"although iI'm not sure about the quality. but should fit your equipment Yes cause I'm new so don't want to get expensive goggles in case I don't like it. 1s or 2s better look in #announcements. the mob6 2024 is an absolute disaster So it supports my beta fpv goggles Also the mobula 7. I will gwt the tx16s Ok, thank you, is one necessarily better than the other Usually you look up how much amps the motors will aproximately draw and choose a fitting esc. I think for normal freestyle with a quad that s not super aggressive 45A should be enough Should I be good in manual mode on my first day of fpv No flying the actual drone"
what do you mean. have you trained in a sim before?. you mean if its okay to fly manual on the first day?,Yes I trained in the sim for 40 hours now. And tried my first manual flight today with cetus pro if youre confident then its okay But I noticed with cetus pro in manual if I let go of the joysticks it still moves forward but why are you l0ooking for another drone if you already have the cetus Yes Im looking for a better and quicker whoop. Cetus is my practice one
it still rotates or it just moves forward?,It just moves forward Lol how when I don't put any power on it lol
if its angled forward then the trust will move it forward. im confused now. let go of the throttle stick too?,Yes and it still moves forward. Like if I keep my finger on the one that controls hight and let go of the one that moves forward and backwards it still goes forward
youre just changing the angle of the drone in manual/acro mode. haven't you tried acro in the sim before?,"I'm going to try flying it in a massive field and get use to the manual mode. Yes I have it should act just like in the sim Oh fairs. @Professional_Crasher  do you need goggles for fpv. Or they not essential its first person view. doesn't make that much sense without flying. without goggles its LOS Ik but could you not just not have it in Los monitors are kinda blah Or I get a monitor for my controller and LOS is really hard and not super fun in my experience. it's just a black speck, not like planes I flew camerea drones so use the vlos Why is it very uncomfortable glare is real annoying and a monitor wont be much cheaper than goggles also unless you get the skyzone monitor or a custom setup they tend to have pretty bad recievers I will deffo get either mob 7 or maybe even a Darwin baby ape pro no darwin. their qc is so bad it's a fire hazard. like, wired backwards. also a lot of their mounts are proprietary and I dunno if the mob7 has a ph2.0 you'd want to replace. betafpv meteor or air. 65 for indoors, 75 for in/out. essentially, see the beginners shopping list in the FAQ"
such a big radio for such a small drone?,"how big are your hands, do you plan to fly planes as well. I'd recommend the Boxer Crush or Jumper T15 instead for just drone use the boxer is already quite big and I have large hands I have really big hands alr then. if your comfortable with it the boxer will still be fine for big hands, it's just that the tx16s has *too* many switches for a quad, and isn't super backpackable With planes you need separate licenses to drones don't you No planes under 250 grams No rc planes under 250 grams Yes Rc planes under 250g. Also many of the horizon umx planes but I oppose those on principle Also you don’t need a separate license over or under 250g, at least in the us Any antenna that I could replace the stock one on my vr03 googles. From beta fpv"
"I want a second opinion on this, I have a speedybee TX800 that I'm planning on using on an RC car im building, since it has alot of thermal mass with the metal cover thing I figure on 25mw it'll be fine under the shell with no airflow, what do yall think?","Any antenna that I could replace the stock one on my vr03 googles Should I go for 45A, F55A, or F65A if I am using the 1950KV Flash 2207 FPV Motor and a 22.2V 6S 1300mAh 100C LiPo I have a similkar setup with a 45A esc. or 55. but my max amp draw for all motors together is around 80A So I should go with a 55A depends on your flying style. but i think theres not much of a price difference. so yeah"
"I have a question about charging and discharging rates. For instance, for a 300mAh 75C 1S LiPo that can handle decent discharge rates, everyone tells that you should charge only at 1C for battery longevity. I’ve tried charging it at 1.66C (500mA) and 2C (600mA) once each and there is absolutely no heat buildup whatsoever, so I’m curious: what’s the reasoning behind limiting the charging rate, especially when the battery is rated for such higher discharge currents? like chemical processes or thermal dynamics - that makes charging more impactful?","I had chat gpt write a response I hope this helps my lazy ass was curious too. The primary reason for limiting charging rates on LiPo batteries is indeed due to the underlying chemistry and heat dissipation dynamics, which differ from discharge behavior. Even though a battery can discharge at high rates (75C in your case), charging puts different stresses on the internal chemistry.  Here's why charging at a higher rate can be more impactful:  1. Electrode Stability: During charging, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode. Moving these ions quickly (i.e., at high charge rates) can cause stress on the anode material, particularly if it's not fully receptive. Over time, this can lead to plating of lithium ions on the anode, reducing overall capacity and potentially leading to thermal runaway risks.   2. Heat Dissipation: Charging generates heat differently than discharging because the energy is moving into the cell rather than out. Even if the battery isn’t heating up visibly, rapid charging can cause localized hotspots that degrade battery life over time, especially near connectors and within densely packed cells.   3. Electrolyte Degradation: Faster charging can accelerate the breakdown of the electrolyte, impacting the longevity of the cell. At higher currents, the electrolyte may start to form unwanted compounds, reducing the efficiency of the lithium-ion exchange and increasing internal resistance over time.    While you didn’t observe significant heat at 1.66C or 2C, the degradation effects might be subtle and accumulate with each high-rate charge. The 1C guideline is a balance between performance and longevity, even if modern cells can often tolerate higher rates for occasional use."
How do I know when the chargering is finished?,"voltage is at whatever you set it to go to, and current drops to 0, and probably also the charger beeps at you"
"Dominator V2, like the white and blue ones that came out 10 years ago?","Not likely to work at all. Those goggles have a screen resolution of 600x480, and only support up to 720x480 on the HDMI input"
Can I use cable ties temporarily for a my battery? I do not have any battery straps.,yeah. What effects my video range if Is it soely tthe powewr of my vtx. Id also imagin the goggles effect this and the antennas but by how much do I really need expensive goggles for long range or are the jsut expesive becuse of the features like the screed and ect ect Antennas can change the most for the east amount of money. Antenna placement is also important liek thesehttps://www.getfpv.com/skyzone-sky02o-oled-5-8ghz-fpv-goggles-w-steadyview-diversity-rx-black.html\. how much range could I get with them with a 600mw vtx with a foxxer lolipop attached to the vtx. @Professional_Crasher estimate
"Hey guys, a capacitor got ripped off of my camera, how can I fix this? I have the little capacitor",clean it up and solder it back if you have a hot air gun good solder and flux. not hot air gun heat gun sorry it comes wiht soldering stations
Even tho the copper is gone?,"do you have the equipment I have everything but a heat gun You risk the cable ties cutting into the battery if you crash, and they are not *nearly* as easy to get on and off I mean like the copper pad on the camera is almost fully gone yeah that is what costs quite a bit of money but its essential for smds and you need to heat bothe end becuse if you heat one end by the time you heat the other side its ""cold "" again Yea I kept having this issue you should be bale to still solder there becuse there is a bit of the copper left and what other choice do you have Yea I honestly just want it fixed for the weekend, I have another one coming Monday yeah look give it a go if it works it work if it dosent it dosent have fun and learsomething maby while doing it Yea I’ll try again. Thanks In ideal circumstances probably not more than a couple miles, realistically less so assuming 3 miles around 4.8km lokk my drone aint going to be able to fly now here neer that far. I should be fine Definitely, 600mw is plenty power for most. yeah I have a heavily modded tinyhawk 2 freestyle with elrs bettermotors and 600mw vtx and oh boy it rips like a 5"" you only feel it when you do prop of trics where its more floaty. @Loen"
I have 4.2 but it did go to 4.21 is that normal?,My whole ports tab got reset help
Should Electrical tape work better?,"Better for the battery, at least. This seems like an idea born of cursed desparation to fly though, rather than just buying new straps I'm at my grandfather, which I don't usually do very often, he wanted to see it fly and no shop nearby sells straps and I'm going home tomorrow Fair enough. Yea tape tf out of it around the top plate so it doesn't go anywhere. And don't crash lol"
Do you have a backup of your settings?,Unfortunately nope. I managed to fix the vtx port. I managed to find a fix the receiver port. But the stick movement are not showing. I use the radiomaster RP1 V2 elrs receiver. With the radiomaster pocket transmitter with a ranger nano elrs module If all that's reset was the Ports tab then you should get receiver input if you set it correctly It solder the receiver to the r6 and t6 pads. And turned on the serial Rx in uart 6 Get a screenshot of the Ports tab now
"I have HQProps, two of the props have an ”R” mark on the prop. And the other two does not have that. What does ”R” mean?. It is ”right”? Like right and left. Btw, In betaflight I did set reverse direction to true",Usually there is no right left. Because your gonna have 2 different props on both sides. Cw and ccw right and also Cw and ccw left
Is this correct?. Or should I switch front and back?,That's correct for props out
"Okay, is props out the correct way when I did enable ”reverse direction” for the motors in betaflight?",Turns out when I tried it last time I was  keeping the iron on the part for way too long. Literally takes a tap and it’s soldered
do you think the latency would be under 40ms?,Hang on. I know someone has tested this. One sec @OCEOLO996
@OCEOLO996  Walksnail VRX with goggles latency tests [Bardwell's Test Results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuZM3dElYdw&t=1031s) [Rosser's Test Results](https://youtu.be/0MhXD9zEdqM?si=PlLN2osShfWkPFuT&t=210),"tysm. im def gonna check that FWIW I personally fly the Walksnail VRX on both the HDZero goggles and an HDMI capture card to my iPad Pro. The latency in the HDZero Goggle is not something I notice on an airplane (will be testing on a freestyle quad in a few weeks), but I can start to feel the latency when flying from my iPad"
"the latency is something like 30-40ms tho, right?","The latency on the Walksnail signal itself is 30-40ms, generally. Carl Zhou has said the HDMI latency on the HDZero Goggle is incredibly low, like 2ms or less. Any additional latency would be coming from the Walksnail VRX itself thats super low. @DædalusFPV latency from camera to cobra x is 80ms..."
How far down can I run these batteries?,"Huh. U mean save the setting It'd be nice to see a new test, Walksnail has updated firmware a lot since Jan 2023. Same as any other lipo, land at 3.4-3.5V/cell"
"im new, what would that be?",@Vitroid i managed to find the respective uarts but the receiver tabs is not showing stick movements
"Sorry, can you get another updated screenshot? This time an actual screenshot",Yes sure. the recevier tab. i use a external elrs module did the receiver work before you reset the ports tab I got the external model delivered today so. And this happened when I was at my friends house. He had accidentally pressed the ports and hit the save button while I was setting up the my vtx yes or no :loudly_crying_face:. did you solder rx to tx and tx to rx
What exactly do you not know?,helo i need help. This is the first time I bought a drone. I need your attention can someone help me please! This is what I don't know ELRS
Heeft de drone een crossfire receiver?,wacht ik ga kijken. ja
"https://youtu.be/Ypn71lIu8l8?si=l1gy663gzej96vEo. Deze zou ik ff kijken. En sowieso wat van die gast. En weet niet zeker of hij daar zegt hoe je moet binden, ik gebruik zelf ELRS, maar anders zijn er vast wel tutorials. Waarom gebruik je eigenlijk crossfire?","Iemand heeft tegen mij gezegd koop deze dan gaat het helpen Niet handig van diegen die iemand heeft tegen je gelogen ik heb de video gekijken Beetje outdated inmiddels en je een beetje verkloot, en je heel veel geld gekost Nou niet per sé. Crossfire is gewoon prima. Maar ELRS beter nee eigenlijk is crossfire niet zo prima voor heel wat redenen dus ik heb dat voor niks gekocht en het kost bakken veel geld wat moet ik nu doen. ga de crossfire  niet werken"
Wat maakt het dan slecht?,Uberhaupt is het slomer en is slechter dan zelfs 2.4 ELRS in heel veel scenarios maar ook is het moeilijker voor tinywhoops en het is gewoon echt super duur Ik dacht dat het gewoon ongeveer hetzelfde maar iets duurder was
Oh ja. Ik zie t. Ugm. @Shamil kan je t nog terugsturen?,die module is 70 euro en vaak zijn de ontvangers minstens 30 euro warom ga ik dat terugsturen Omdat ELRS beter is. En goedkoper Dus dan kan je dat veel beter gebruiken. ExpressLRS. Zoek t op zou ik zeggen waarschijnlijk heeft je jumper het al Heb ik ook net gekocht. Goede keuze Heeft ExpressLRS. Dus stuur de module en receiver terug Of de hele drone. En koop de expresslrs versie van de drone of als je alleen de receiver vervangt een ELRS receiver. Dan heb je niet eens een module nodig die drone heb ik allang gekocht
Is er nog iemand die kan mij helpen?,https://discord.gg/HzYcybMK. Je kan t hier vragen T is wel 00:19 dus ik weet niet hoe veel mensen nog wakker zijn om te helpen dan ga ik met mijn programma verder werken :slightly_smiling_face:
"Hey, is drone flipping a thing?. do people buy old/""broken"" drones, flip them, and sell for profit?","not really from what I can tell, most people either repair their drones themselves or quit the hobby What does air mode do in betaflight. Idk what it's called Can any one help me use the dji controller 2 with betaflight It basically means that your in acro mode, but whenever your not making inputs the drone stays in its current state"
Isn't that basically acro?,Yeah. Its an important distinction though. Also if you hit the ground your quad bounces for some reason
Is there even an option to enable acro in bf?,"There are tossers that try on eBay here in the UK.  Most of em are stuck trying to sell decade old crap for new prices, it's hilarious. Pretty sure it’s just a box that says air mode or not. Since acro is the default I thought air mode was the default how do i let my drone arm without having required satellites doesn't that kind of defeat the point of having the gps in the first place tied turning min sat to 0 and the allowed range is 5. i jus wanna fly it inside rn. its smal its 2.5 inch u think ima break stuff"
3 inch?. I think that too,"But depends if its open prop or not its not. i was jus gunna try goin slow ill disarm if its to hard xD, but i dont see a didnt see a way to turn off rth or some way to jus let it fly. ill try another utube vid but the first one failed me on the configuration page. just turn off gps kk ty i found it i didnt have expert mode on i guess it jus disables return to home if u allow arm without fix makes sense ig. im not good enuf to fly that thing inside lol feels heavier then I thought it would ill have to wait til tommorow to practice flying it :frowning_face_with_open_mouth: Air mode runs on top of acro mode. They are distinct things that work together. Air mode is part of why the quad bounces on the ground, it keeps the PID loop active even when you are at 0% throttle, so the quad doesn't tumble Why does it bounce. Also is it an intended thing or is it a side effect The bouncing is a side effect. The PID Loop tries to react to negate any external force that acts on the quadcopter so that it's not bouncing around and wobbling in the air when you don't tell it to. When it hits the ground obviously its attitude changes so the PID Loop reacts to that by spinning up the other propellers. That causes it to jump a little bit and then they spool down because it's stable and it hits the ground again and it becomes this back and forth. When air mode is off, and you land and you're at zero throttle, the PID Loop has no Authority so it doesn't react in the same way as when air mode is enabled. That's why people will have air mode on a switch and turn it off when they try to perch on like a lamp post or a roof Oh that’s actually kinda neat. I wonder if I could have the three way switch I currently have be angl, acro, air I don't have a CLI command to fix that"
Gives me the heeby jeebys. What does it say on beta flight?,"just look and compare it to what it should be... find one of those charts to explain what each is Here is my questins. How to fix. 3 motors worked after replacing everthing know only 2 have worke have yet to fly everything but transmitter and motor have been replaceded Aight don’t full blast the throttle like that What you mean i move the slidey things on beta flight the motors won't go but the ones that are going in the vid. Me kinda hoping they don't work to give excuses to get the super nova 2077. Only bad thing abt those are price lol theres no load on your motors so they spin way faster than they would be able to in the air. i doubt it would actually damage them but i hate to hear those bearings go that fast lol these are the best quad motors on the market from what ive heard granted it was kinda promo material but it sure made sense the guy that designed them is a thermo engineer for jet engines But it probably be over +100 bucks to get. He test like 50 differnt motors!!! And like 20000 tests!!! Bro got some dedication what he did was input all the measurements for efficiency and size of a bunch of motors into a program, ran machine learning on it so the computer would learn what each value changed, and then it made and tested like 10,000 motors automatically and picked the best one. yeah so he bought the 50 and put it into the program so the program knew how motors worked. and then the program did the 20,000 tests and picked the best one Oooh ok well it's pretty interesting what he did :thinking_face: but anyways gnit it's 1 30 for me cya. you need to figure out if the esc is communicating with betaflight correctly. see if it spins up in BF, see if its found in the firmware configurator"
"Radiomaster Boxer and Pocket show up on eBay regularly, but they frequently sell for near new prices.. The Nazgul ECO is well priced when new, so I doubt you'll find one at bargain prices anywhere.. Would this be your first drone?",yeah i looked on ebay hoping for something but i didn't find many results so i was hoping theres other places people sell drones. im specifically looking for a nazgul eco 5 and then any goggles or any remote for a good price
yeah just hoping to save a bit of money even if its not much i would be able to buy extra props and batteries and small stuff with the money. yes. i dont plan on buying anything just yet as im currently learning in the sim for a couple more months. so is it not really worth looking for things second hand?,"Get your radio sorted and use that in the sim first. :slightly_smiling_face: also is it cheaper too build up ur own drone is a question ive always wondered since i already have a soldering iron at home thats the plan im just saving up for lift off and a controller first which i want to buy soon. ah great ill probably do that since i can save money and compromise where needed Not liftoff. It is trash.. Old, outdated and bad physics."
ive heard its one of the best? ill only be playing on console so im limited to choice,"various searching around. though tbh ive heard completely opposite stuff from many people so i should probably take advice with a pinch of salt :face_with_tears_of_joy: Only having a console will make things tricky, that's for sure. yeah its only for some learning and fun then id rather just go straight out Liftoff hasn't been touched by the developers for years now. It's **very** out of date. It never had good physics even when it was being actively worked on. I'm preparing to set up my RadioMaster Nomad ExpressLRS (ELRS) module to comply with EU regulations for the 2.4 GHz band. However, in the ExpressLRS Configurator, I can't find the ""Regulatory_Domain_EU_CE_2400"" option in the firmware settings. I'm awaiting delivery of the device and want to ensure a smooth setup upon arrival."
Do you have an idea of what i can change to make it better?,"It means that the filter settings aren't particularly good for your quad, after a good filter tune you shouldn't have any red or white blobs I would just use a preset, like the supafly one, or one by UAVtech, or just the default one, or you can go over to https://discord.com/channels/868013470023548938/964244099274276974 and send the BBL (I have no clues how to tune a quad well)"
"What you thinking about Domian 4.2 (elrs 2.4 analog) is it durable , good for freestyle ?","Well, 4"" quads are kind of an akward place to be, you don't have the ""micro feel"" of a 3.5"" and you also don't get all the power of a 5"", so it's a bit of an awkward middle ground, so except if you know you want a 4"" quad, consider going with a 5"" or 3.5"" (or 3"") instead And it should be plenty durable for freestyle, tho it is really heavy for it's size"
"Are you 100% sure you are on the right channel ? Cause that could easily be the cause (chose manually the channel on the goggles, and check the channel of the quad in betaflight, don't use automatic channel finders)","Yo guys can someone help me i bought a new camers and i have this weird look inside my google like this I ckeckt all channels it still doesnt work. I put fatshark channel 6 in bezaflight and and in my google but still this weird look Anybody know what size antenna go on the sky030 They should be sma antennas Also, if you haven't bought them yet, I personally wouldn't as they fov is fairly small at only 35° Any others tou would recommend for simialr performance around 200-30. 300*. Are the sky02c any better The cobra x v2/4. Better receiver, bigger fov How big. Also whats the receiver *use google* And before you say it's huge box goggles, no their not huge What goggles are these The top one are the hdzero goggles (I love them) Are the sky02c any good Which is why I (unfortunately) don't recommend them often Just finding used goggles for decent prices I would really just get the cobras"
For how much?. $50-$100 sure. No more,"Absolutely not lol. I have them, they're not worth more than 150 at most nowadays *just get the cobra x v4*"
How old are the goggles?,"Less than a year, haven’t used them in maybe amonth or two"
How do they behave once you unplug them?,"Sounds like the internal battery has gone bad I’ll open them up and take a look. There is a slightly sticky material on the battery, not sure if that’s meant to be there or not its prolly glue. i might be wrong but it looks like you can prolly just buy a new battery. wait for deadlus though nightmare flashbacks of seeing the ev800d internals. with the battery that feels like a brick. It's just a 1s battery so you can replace it with whatever. maybe get rid of the internal one completely and have an external one, helps comfort why does nobody ever have foam on the eachine this si jsut hard plastic. no foam like on the cobras that's not the piece that mounts to your face. It extends by like double the length Yeah I took the screen off it's the most uncomfortable thing you'll ever see we need a middle price point in beetween the eachine and cobras. or atleast better eachine ergonomics yeah so fun fact. the Cobra X were kind of the middle pricepoint between ev800d and high end goggles. the ones in-between always kind of sucked or lacked features. so i think this is probably the best it gets thats kinda unfortuinate"
"So I was just doing checks on all my lipos and one of my 4s batteries cells read as 0.1v, 0.1v, 0.2v, 1.0v .-.   This battery was perfectly healthy and fine as of yesterday for sure.

okay. the blheli one?,"i have only worked with aio boards so i have no idea what im doing here Note about that:  Original EV800D's use an internally balanced 2S. EV800 and EV800D Clones typically tend to use 1S yeah that checks out. for how shitty mine were xD. mine had the 2S. which freaked me out since it only had 2 wires it's the exact same interface as Betaflight... you press connect in the top right and then read settings in the bottom right. mine had a 1s cell. and it constantly overheated oof. mine survived several hours out in 35°C sun. EV100's didn't lol mine didn't really survive much of anything over time they literally got worse too. don't know how that works yeah that happens when they overheat but that is what happened the capacitors and other circuitry goes out of spec, so the signal isolation/filtering gets more and more useless @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I was downloading a bunch of stuff lmao it got to the point where I couldn't get more than 50~ meters way without it becoming black and white. no matter what I did yeah it was probably way off center freq"
my analog experience haunts me to this day to say the least. well what is it on?. blheli_s or bluejay?,yeaaah flash it to the latest bluejay
is bluejay better then?,"you have bidirectional dshot on which I don't think blheli_s supports still, so you have to put the better bluejay on it. yes in about every way okay nice. what esc and frequency do i choose esc is already selected for you, it shows in your previous screenshot as well. you can try 48 for the frequency show a screenshot once it's done bottom right. oh it's not there. maybe reconnect"
reconnecting now. like read settings?,bottom right there should be a melody editor. once you read and connect again YEP THE MOTORS SPIN NOW!. omg this is how people get those startup sounds yuup. melody editor is how you do it. pick any song
"okay, do I have to hit save somewhere?","@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) okay so im getting another issue now, Two motors wont change direction with the wizard do it in esc-configurator ""write settings"" bottom right Bottom right somewhere"
"if im buing an fpv drone, i get a gogles with drone, or i need to buy them myself?","There are kits like that around, but everyone here recommends you strongly steer clear of them since they are all super crappy.. Fpv is very complicated and daunting at first but we can definitely help you pick out parts, having your own gear is very worth the extra effort. Also, instead of starting with a full set up you can also just get a radio(it’s what we call our special controller) and a sim and practice with no consequences"
"so, in what budget i can get an good, not too fast fpv drone for begginer?",This is a good place to look https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639/1144567226670788639. But if your on a budget I would reccomend the raidiomaster pocket and a simulator like velocidrone to get started
"i need to buy app to train, yeah?",Did you pull “do not pull”. Yes. It’s not too expensive in the grand scheme of things
"If the xt60 cable is to long, or if it is fine?. Should I pull it?","I am unable to awnser that tbh logic thing, if you see a dont pull it, you shouldnt pull that, i think"
Can you flip your battery around and use it like that?,"no. the cable is to short for that Ah. Dang right in the weird middle spot yea. if I rotate the battery 90 degrees its perfect... i dont really know what i need to have everything (to fly a fpv drone), i am a little new. i mean, i bought an e88 pro, thats a 30$ drone and its not fpv. + i cant connect it with my computer for simulator You don’t connect your actual drone to the sim. I would do this. Completely fine, anyway questions are ok. Just aslong as you use your common sense i am 14 year old i dont really know what could go wrong. (with my sense). anyway, i wanted to buy mavic 1/2 the mavics are basically flying camera tripods, great if you want to take pretty pictures, bad for if you want to have fun flying"
does it is still an fpv?,"no. I think it might be able to connect to certain goggles, but the general terms are as such:. camera drones are your flying tripods. They're full autopilot with gimbals, you just give suggestions on where it should go and they fly themselves. No fancy flying whatsoever. FPV drones have minimal assistance, usually just basic stablilization to make the thing flyable by a human. Lots of fun, can do tricks and cool shots You can turn off air mode for no assistance basically that's still the same amount of assistance Oh what. Wha. What even is the assistance besides air mode both air and acro mode are the same mode, air just keeps your props spinning when you cut throttle so the PID loop can still stabilize you. whereas plain acro turns off the motors completely im not a crazy person for doing tricks or being a slitghly from crashing with both of them, you request pitch, yaw, and roll rates and the flight controller spins the motors to achieve that. you don't have to do tricks, you can swoop around just fine. I shall second the suggestion to get a Radiomaster Pocket Crush or Boxer with ELRS and a sim and try it out i heard somewhere, that i a drone is over 250g i need a license for flying, but thats maybe a fake"
"depends on your country, and also that's not really what it is in the US. under 250g you don't have to register and put a remote ID module on it when flying in the recreational rules. ah, here's the video skipped to where I actually fly https://youtu.be/SC9FJgc3MX8?si=yYmIyHpAHsIJFXA6&t=102","i cant really tell if thats good, or bad, also in my country over 250g to 900g i need a licence, i can get that license for free. oh wait what's good or bad. my flying in that clip is pretty bad, I've gotten better bad is when your crashing, i think hop in https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/536623077656625163 I might be able to explain this better with visual aid also, mavic 1 is 249g, so if i would buy i dont need license there are plenty of fpv quads under 250g. https://fpvmarket.eu/european-fpv-stores/. https://fpvmarket.eu/. https://fpv.pl/pl/p/Aparatura-Radiomaster-Pocket-ELRS-EdgeTX-BATERIE/495. https://rcmaniak.pl/pl/p/Akumulator-Radiomaster-5000mAh-7.4V-2S1P-TX-LiIon/5448. https://rcmaniak.pl/pl/p/LG-INR18650-MH1-3200mAh-Li-ION-3%2C7V/3927"
dosent turning vtx too high damage it. so same prinicple?. or are both wrong and im stupid,If i turn my boxer up to 1w will that affect my drone(mobula 8) turning the vtx too high with no cooling will hurt *the vtx*. the boxer's internal module has a fan also. use dynamic power <https://is.gd/lbHYjf>
Output power or size difference?,"i wondered what is difference between radiomaster pocket ELRS, and RadioMaster Boxer ExpressLRS The Pocket is a lot smaller, and the internal transmitter module is limited to 250mW compared to the 1000mW in the Boxer i dont really know what that means output power. size difference doesnt really matter to me ""how loud it screams"". That's probably the best approximation. Higher output power = longer max range. But it doesn't scale linearly"
"guys could i in theory take a camera drone like a dji mini 2 or something, and just like tape an fpv system to the top of it and fly with goggles?. i know it wouldnt be acro or anything but like. like if i just glue an o3 unit onto a camera drone, and give it a power source, then could it be done?","You would need a way to arm the O3 unit It'd be easier with a different system well then a walksnail system. could you do it with that yeah you can just turn ""standby mode"" off"
So is it lifting off or not?,@Vitroid bro my drone is lifting off. Even if I bring it to half throttle it will not lift off
Then it might be too heavy?,It's a 3.5  speedybee cinewoop. Per built
Does it lift off or not?,"Damn, and for free. Can we see how you put on the props (from the underside) Also, check if all the motors are spinning in the same direction (**with props off, no need to chop your fingies**) as shown in the betaflight motor tab"
where did you buy the red stickes and the red switches covers for the zorro? im looking to buy one,Idk not my photo. I just have a Boxer damn he is beautiful. https://tenor.com/view/stunned-wow-omg-lego-batman-lego-batman-movie-gif-7647770 What are the best 6s batteries also for mostly freestyle what mah should I get
Esc config is saying already have a device port?,i really like the 6s lihv 1300mah 120c battery by gnb Should I get the gps pre installed or not on my Nazgul evoque v2 6s
"if i will have batteries to radiomaster with different input, how will i charge battery?","i mean, if i would have batteries like this i dont have cable to charge it The radio can charge them internally you plug the radio in"
"oh, that makes sense. would it work same with drone?. or i need to get charger","No. Drone batteries need a proper charger What props are good for the Nazgul evoque v2. For freestyle Behold, my copy pasted list ; Gemfan f4s (great response) Gemfan 51433 (good all around, lots of thrust and good responsiveness, also very good vibrations) Gemfan 5226 (nice top speed, not the most responsive) HQprops j40 (very very good feel in the air but crappy efficiency, if the efficiency was better, it would be my main prop, it's so good) HQprops v2s (very good all around, lots of thrust and efficiency, currently my main prop, it's good at everything) HQprops 4.8x3.4x4 (very good grip, doesn't produce as much thrust as other props like the v2s) HQprops ethix p3.5 (a community favorite, not my favorite, (I prefer higher pitch) but still a great lower pitched prop) HQprops ethix p3 (lower pitch version of the p3.5) HQprops r38 (if you do racing, that's the prop to have imo, otherwise, don't bother with it) HQprops ethix s5 (I genuinely don't understand why people love it, imo it's mid everywhere, but because so many people love it, it's here) Dalprop napal n1 (a ""v2s+"")  As a general note, hq is on average better balanced than gemfan (And my favorite is the v2s, it feels *just right*, also I live at 1300m above sea level so air is less dense (less thrust) if you want to take that into account). And you should try as many props as you can as they have a massive effect on the feel of the quad"
This looks like I will have to remove the BMS and put it on the new cell. @Llama  is it easy to do ?,Size looks right by eye. But I'd advise you to measure you existing pack first and double check the size. Last time I replaced a tango 2 battery I stole the BMS and wiring off the old cell to transfer it over to the new cell.
"Hi I need to buy good FPV sim , my budget is 15Eur , what sim should i get ?","velocidrone. for about 17euros If you have a lot of soldering experience its pretty straightforward. But this is DEFINITELY not the thing to do your first soldering on.  You can't heat the tab too long or it will travel heat into the cell and damage the cell. Heat it too much and itll go:fire::firecracker: If you just gotta do it once then you can get away with whatever solder/flux you got handy.  There is also special solder out there for this purpose, just as a FYI. Hello, so i got Nanohawk 65x , couple days ago i was flying it outside while there was no wind landed like usual and it was all fine ,yesterday i took it to my work and at break time turned on and had no OSD showing up. So today i got a chance to connect it to BF, first thing i got is default BF settings to apply ( usual thing when u get new FC) and from there i setted up everything motors my osd configuration tab as well. Everything seems correct, but when i tried to fly it just freaked out. Props direction is correct so is settings in BF( i think) If allowed i can add pictures of BF @Llama so them 2 tabs needs soldering onto the bms board Yes. Use a multimeter and measure them to find out which is +/- Then just take the BMS and wiring harness off the old cell and transfer it to the new one.  Be sure to triple check polarity.  Always cover with tape or something the tab you are not working on. That way a accidentall short is very unlikely.. You can also email TBS and I'm sure they can provide you a cell all pre assambled. That way you just drop it in and wouldn't have to do any soldering. I cannot find any stocks of this battery in the UK. I am kind of an intermidiate solderer Do it outside, with a sand or water emergency bucket to toss it in if needed. If you got some old shitty batteries you don't mind damaging. Practice on one of thoose. Will give you an idea of the challenges here. Work hot and fast. hmmm I dont like working with bats at the best of time without having to heat them up Ask a local hobby shop or someone else near you if they can do the solder job for you. Or Email TBS and get a premade one.  Thoose are kinda ur only 2 options then I guess. Take your props off and check with your finger if the y spin the same direction as displayed in the motors tab Take the darn props of or you'l hurt yourself. :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"
"Probably board orientation has gotten changed on accident. Or motor direction/betaflight motor config are missmatched.  This video is rather old, but will detail all the possible solutions for your issue. https://youtu.be/X4746_KLVEI?si=eGx8as_jvVq8wnHt","good advice, but since its whoop which feels kinda like itch when prop hits:grinning_squinting_face: On whoop u dont have to haha. Diddnt know it was a whoop sorry okay will do, ill first try what other fellow guy suggested and then yours if its still same. nah you all good haha Its just that i had to get stitches for a 5 inch lmao i had as well accident with 5inch ages ago but it wasnt that bad so it healed up on itself Ah nice. Now test the motors, im curious haha"
"Idk, did you mount your fc with the 'arrow' on it facing to the front?","so you see because of the micro usb its been mounted sideways. but i've done the config to match it ill drop one vid. thats from earlier, as you can see it responds to controls as it should"
You know like the first tab in betaflight where you see a 3d model of the drone? Tilt your drone in all the directions to check if it displays correctly. It probably doesnt,This would work anyways
would it matter if i dont use accelerometer?,"Enable it temporarily for this test pitch is fine , but yaw and roll are inverted Go to this tab. And check if the 3d model does the same as your drone. Lkke pitch it forward it should do the same in the model. Do that for pitch roll and yaw so receiver does follow through my stick movement correctly, but 3D model in Setup tab doesn't only pitch is correct and yaw with roll are inverted Okay. Good. Weve found your problem Now we need to know how to fix it, i dont know how to so i suggest making a post in #help-with-drones saying that the 3d model doesnt show the same as what you're doing irl. Then someone smart will tell you numbers to enter somewhere:KEKw: yeah i tried with them roll, yaw, but never managed and it would just make everything off in the 3D model The 3d model needs to do the exact same as your quad irl otherwise it'll never work"
We need a few pics of the craft. See how this FC has a little arrow? 99% of FC'S should have a little arrow on it.  If the FC is not installed where the arrow is on the top of the FC facing forward then you have an alignment issue. Once we know what way its offset then we can make the needed correction. Send some pics in your thread.,took a bit time. ill create a thread in help with drones
Hey I have a 6s 22v battery and I always charge each cell to 3.9 before flying but nearly everytime I fly it almost immediately drops to 3.2 I had a crash a while ago that damaged the battery and am starting to think this may be the cause (please don’t just rush to that conclusion) is there anything else that could cause this?,"It should be charged to 4.2V per cell. But yes, if the battery no longer holds charge after a crash, it's likely toast"
Oh hey I was right. Is 22v the normal max charge?,Why was it labeled as 22v
how do people get range thats countable in km with 25mw wideo output power?,good gear. a 25mw VTX with a big antenna sticking out the back is gonna make it longer than a 800mw VTX with a whip antenna on it
"mostly receiver and antennas, right?. i mean. there isnt pretty much anything else","yeah, and having a good VTX is important, my Flywoo 850mw VTX can go much further than my Speedybee 800mw VTX Speedybee make trash gear, more news at 10.. There's a reason it's cheap AF."
"It should, but why not just use a bind phrase ?",Ok so I’m mounting a vtx but for some reason the mounting screws go through the holes on the frame. I’m using the source one v5 5 inch
@Toast.riscv opinion?,it all returns to me :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: If I push that out the screws go through Then they're too small It’s not a deal breaker though You should have like 4 more of the medium long bigger screws Yeah tried those but the head is the same width The 2 top ones are the long ones. In the picture. I used both Both sets go through. But it’s fine Oooh the ones that fit your vtx are too small. I understand now If I hold the vtx down the I can use them as feet that stick out to stop them sliding. So zip ties it is You could try using nuts on the underside of the frame Fr. I’ll try the nuts underneath but if not it’s gonna be zip ties. It worked but the short ones can’t go all the way through lol You could cut the longer ones if you have a saw that can cut metal Yeah that’s what is was gonna ask. Looks pretty cold though
"Do you have loctite tho ? If you don't, those nuts are going to fly right off. I would recommend you use double sided (vhb if possible) tape instead, that's what I use to mount all my vtxs instead of screws",My VTX didn't even come with screw holes
https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/hqprop-4x25x3-props-light-yellow  Can I use this props with the geprc tern lr40? newb here,"Yea, you can, it'll be less efficient though, generally. Whether or not it's less efficient in a hover is a toss-up"
"As in power usage? I'm just trying to find alternative propellers as I want to change the colour and the hq T4X2.5 only appear in grey. At least I can't find them anywhere else with a different colour, and it kinda helps me to fly Los with different colour propellers","The Gemfan Hurricane 2024x2 comes in grey, ""yellow"" (more of a green in the pictures), blue, and red"
Ok. How do I bind it then. Plug and unplug the battery 3x?. I can’t get it to connect to betaflight. @DædalusFPV,"Just got my air75 first fpv drone. Is the drone already setup for me to bind elrs what do I have to change. If it’s already on 3.3 do I have to flash new fw If both the receiver and the transmitter module are already on 3.x firmware then you don't *need* to update the firmware in order to bind. It's good practice to update everything to the most recent version when you get them, however Problems connecting to betaflight could mean you have a driver problem, or a cable problem, I would suggest either trying the impulseRC driver fixer if you're on windows, or just trying a different cable. ELRS binding instructions are fairly widely available online. If you have a specific question about a step in the process, feel free to ask it here"
you have the radio master boxer?,you are literraly me lol Tbh I like the feel of the pocket better im getting the air 75 also
@Emilia (XT90 Janklet) any help for this guy?. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3IiKlwFtwk&t=156s this vid explains it pretty well,if you want to just get up and flying skip the binding phrase although binding phrase really isnt that hard and is totally worth the time. don't follow videos for this kind of stuff. they'll always end up being outdated
its 2 months old. anything update since then?. then what do you reccomend to follow?,"They are great and easy and always up to date. On their website. https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/binding/#traditional-binding The vtx feels like it’s getting really hot That's normal even under the best circumstances. If you're concerned about it, keep a small fan blowing over the board while it's sitting on the bench"
"when replacing the balance lead connector on a lipo battery, i made sure to repin them 1 by 1 but if i would switch two wires would that cause an issue?. (excluding the red wire of course)","yes. do not do that. if you need to, you can open up the battery pack to check where each wire goes, or use a multimeter to test each wire. they *need* to be in the correct order"
how can i check that with a multimeter?. does the voltage add up?. in order,"in series, each cell adds voltage and at your xt60 you get the max battery voltage. at the balance connectors, each wire gets the voltage of one more cell. if you measure the two furthest apart balance wires, youll get max voltage. move one inward, and youll get the total minus one cell. move two inward, you get the total minus two cells. it will keep going like that until you get to the last two wires you measure, right next to each other, with the voltage of one cell thanks, makes sense fro the diagram these two wires will have 3.7v (nominally). and this 7.4. np somehow my dumb brain always assumed each wire is for one cell separately and the last is ground or something lol. i mean. thats kinda true. the thing is that they add once you start at ground. and they add *in order* I, too, did assume that convention for a period of time (and, luckily, not attempt any multicell LiPo soldering within that period :ultrakek:) understanding the basics of DC circuits, v*a=w, and series vs parallel wiring is really helpful for this hobby"
They aren’t?. Hol up lemme read this convo,refer to the above diagram :Harold: I get it. That’s neat this is what i assumed:
"is there a way to draw a complete ""line"" between those two points through the battery that exemplifies the voltage you're actually reading? i.e. from the left circle, you'd draw to the left cell's positive lead, then jump along the (-) -> (+) connections between cells up to the negative of the 2nd cell from the right, and up to the right circle)? Is that even a remotely correct way of thinking about it?","they are wired like that. the misconception is that *ground* is the ground for each cell, and in reality the one ground is ground for the whole pack, and each positive wire from a cell includes the cells before it It’s basically that each cell is intertwined this would be a 4P pack, p for parallel. you can also get 4s4p or whatever other combinations you can think of. my skateboard is 10s2p. uhhhhhhhhh -# my apologies for causing your brain aneurysm the thing is you can use a multimeter in a lot of different ways. i think i see what you mean, let me redraw it"
but is the red wire red? i know colors dont mean anything but it always bothered me its red :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:. now it finally doesnt bother me,"Watch me coat the ground wire in red paint just to trick the electrons. The electrician will be stumped once and for all! so the wiring color is goofy because many of those wires are negative for one cell and positive for another. ive seen some packs with more red wires than black wires. its annoying and you gotta just ignore it. if you measure from ground, either xt60 or balance lead, to cell number 4, you get cell number 1 voltage Good thing I chose to solder a xt30 to my board instead of convert everything to an xt60. This is headache inducing if you measure from ground to cell 3, you get the voltage of both cell 3 and 4 stacked because cell 4 is inbetween cell 3 and ground. does that explain it @@Galaxy55 (Master of Jank). even though youre measureing from ground, they stack. hence series lol. if that wasnt what you were looking for then idk"
~~i'll go back and read this after a healthier amount of sleep~~ wait yes I think that diagram is exactly what I meant. so. that should measure... 2x3.7v?,"cant find the cable that came with the multimeter cause i used it to close my stuck car window :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: hope I didnt switch them somehow even tho i did it one by one honestly i think in that balance lead, the left 4 wires should be red and the right most should be black. its different from some battery manufacturers"
"I was thinking of it in terms of ""shortest path of resistance""... I know resistance has nothing to do with it, but the voltage is calculated by that ""shortest path"" between a positive and negative terminal  -# *right?*","just plug it into your charger with the balance lead first, im mostly sure it wont kill your charger and the charger will show you if the voltages are wrong. voltage is actually dependent on total resistance. not only one path. but lucky for us there is only one path here oh yeah, it should just read abnormaly high on one and low on another i think assuming it doesnt toast the voltage reader from being double whats expected. i think itll be fine, ive plugged them in backwards before lmao. these chargers are pretty tough oh that would make sense. I guess in that diagram you're not gonna get a reading based off the potential between the far right negative and the ""negative"" side of the left one because... no potential difference lol love my Hota D6. solved me more than problem"
which two wires? every balance wire will give a difference when measured to another balance wire,"shorted 10A on 12V from that Hota D6 for a brief moment and it survived ionwannagetoutmy markup tool rn. but this is *not* the voltage you'd be reading i.e. it logically *has* to measure between the ground (negative) and the positive. uh yes i think youre making it more complicated than it is lol maybe just ignore me, I think this thinking out loud is just confusing you lol. -# **YOU THINK** well, im not confused on how it actually works :KEKw:"
"Looking to get an adapter to connect a 3s battery to the aux port on my fatshark scout, what sort of adapter do I need, anyone knows?","maybe im confused on what youre thinking yeah this. maybe I'll be able to articulate it better another time when I'm not severely sleep deprived... that said, I think you've made sense of it to me, and I applaud this accomplishment of yours"
aux is for video input iirc. if you plug it in via usbc does it power it?,Usb-C then I gueas. Yeah it powers and charges the 18650 battery
Yeah that could work. https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/type-usb-c-5v-to-balance-plug-v2-for-gopro-hero-6-7-8-9/. more inclined for this one. not sure if 5v would be enough though?!,"for sure yeah. I know a bit of a bunch of random things from amateur radio and related hobbies, but I kinda have to make guesses to connect all the info together. I'm not in engineering in terms of education/career lol Will this pop my pinecil. Or is it super smart and pinecil will tell power supply to feed it delicious 12 volts You might get lucky and the pinecil will get 20v dc low. :(. it works with a mac brick. y8ay its smart. a properly made usb C power supply will never supply more than 5v unless the device asks for it"
"Hey guys, I have a question so I have a 85mm whoop and the Vtx is separate from the flight controller I know it’s not ideal but it’s what I have, I currently have it stuck on with double sided foam tape but when I fly it comes unstuck easily from the heat. Is there some other way I can go about sticking it on maybe some certain type of tape?","I'm preparing to set up my RadioMaster Nomad ExpressLRS (ELRS) module to comply with EU regulations for the 2.4 GHz band. However, in the ExpressLRS Configurator, I can't find the ""Regulatory_Domain_EU_CE_2400"" option in the firmware settings. I'm awaiting delivery of the device and want to ensure a smooth setup upon arrival."
"Hey everyone, I have a question about antenna orientation for the SpeedyBee analog module. On my Goggles X, the module is mounted on the top of the goggles, not on the side like with HDzero or some other setups.  Because of this, the antenna is parallel to the goggles instead of being vertical. Unfortunately, there's no way to change the antenna direction since the connector is positioned for a parallel mount rather than vertical.  Is this orientation likely to cause any performance issues, or should it work fine like this?",The orientation how it's on the speedybee module is normal. For best signal you should point the directional antenna at the quad (and the side of the omni) LBT is not supported on the Nomad. You can however run ISM firmware on the Nomad and EU_CE firmware on the receiver without issue. The omni has the worst reception along the axis
"Do you already own this module and the antennas that it came with, or are you asking hypothetically?","Now I'm actually paying attention, you can stick the analog VRx wherever you like on the goggles, it connects to the modbox via cable IIRC. ie. It doesn't plug directly onto it. Same is true of the modbox, to be fair.  There's 3dprints available from the community to mount the VRx on one of the ""eye"" sections and all sorts.. https://discord.gg/wB6Ujvqq"
and what about the other one? do i need t relace it? because it affect nothing if its parallel to the goggles instead of being vertical. because the other one is omni i think,"No that's not what they mean. Omni antennas have a radiation pattern like a donut. The weakest areas of reception are straight out from the top and bottom of the antenna. That's why they are typically oriented straight up and down, so you get the best reception all around yourself (hence the ""omni""-directional moniker).. The antennas that come with the Speedybee VRX are Maple Wireless antennas, they're quite decent here is an omni radiation pattern You have one omni antenna and one directional antenna. The face of the directional antenna needs to be pointed where you want the range/penetration it offers ya but the omni affects nothing because its parallel to the goggles that's how you can basically imagine the difference between omni and directional antennas"
"You know you can get SMA adapters that are angled, right?",With the light being the equivalent to the radiation pattern Get a 90 degree adapter. Or just move the VRX adapter so it's not on top of your goggles. Like you can literally stick it anywhere
you guys said that the worst reception of a omni antenna is the axis. so when i fly thr drone is going to look like this right?. because the omni is parallel to the goggles,"So just turn it 90 degrees bro. Yea the donut will go over your head instead of around your sides, but still"
i need help can i power my toolkit rc m6 with usb at 12v like the usb has written 5v 2.1A but is it safe to power it with 12v from a mackbook charger ???. wait my bad 20v,"You really do have to wonder what some people are even doing in this hobby.  They don't want to learn how to maintain their equipment or how it works, they seem to want someone to do it for them vicariously, every time it needs work. i mean i can some how get a makeshift usb to give out 12v To get proper power out of a usb-c smart power brick, you need a little chip that does the Comms. They can be done from scratch, but you can also buy little breakout boards that'll do it for you.  I've not used em personally, I just know they exist :yellow_heart: That is probably fine. The charger somewhere on it should have a label that tells you what voltage it can accept. Double check it supports 20V. If so then you are good. Just get the plug polarity correct. The USB port is an output, not an input uhh 20v throught the usb port. what bruhh **THE USB PORT IS AN OUTPUT, NOT AN INPUT** i wonder how my house is still in one piece We need pics to be 100% certain what you got here.

Thanks!","Show your ports tab in BF configurator, and a pic of the Rx wiring to the FC. ^ive been helping him a bit, im wondering if theres a model mismatch. he just installed a nomad module into a qx7 access"
do you have time for voice?,"I do not.  https://www.expresslrs.org/software/model-config-match/#model-match No harm is asking. I'm just busy atm is all. That link is to the documentation about model matching.. It **is** a possible outcome, to get your symptoms, if it's configured in just the wrong way. If model match is configured on the Rx, but not the Tx, for example. im just noting that because i had to deal with it when i set mine up a few weeks ago. it isnt obvious that model match is an issue unless it says in the lua script The docs explain it better than I can :yellow_heart: Welp.. Not that then :face_with_tears_of_joy: https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/646818301929848844/1303085806222835774"
quick question. can i be un the rx wifi intreface and check revicer tab at the same time?,"~~yes~~ no. i think so at least. idk i could be wrong If it's in WiFi mode, it's using the Radio chip for WiFi IIRC.. WiFi and ELRS, both 2.4GHz, see. uhhh. they have a seperate antenna for wifi tho. im pretty sure the radio chips are different and the wifi one is built into the esp chip, but i could be wrong Pretty sure one of the Rx I have uses the same antenna, at least.... again, I may be wrong though, I'm no radio nerd :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: wifi antenna here is seperate. i suppose it could just depend on the model The port config and wiring look ok to me.."
Show reciever tab in BF configurator?,okay i tnk i enter wifi mode so mby im not baund. i can't spell XD
"the reciever enters wifi mode after 1 minute of not connecting to a transmitter, regardless of binding. did you do that bind phrase thing i mentioned on both sides?","Yeah, a bind phrase is a good idea. I set mine in the firmware when flashing, though it can be set in the web interface for the Rx."
The only other thing I can suggest is to try moving the Rx to a different Uart.. If you're sure it *is* binding..?,the leds should be different colors on the rx when you turn the tx on vs off im tryung to flash it i dont remember what the colors are or whatever but they should be different
@cyberFluke is gemini mode fine?,"Got it!. its working. thx!!! Bind phrase mismatch :p Job jobbed. Nice one @JasonFPV (Servo Janklet), you did all the lifting there. :face_with_tears_of_joy: ty. all while sitting in electromechanical instrumentation. i hate this class"

"basically, does anyone have any good liftoff drone setups that fly like a 3.5"" maybe like a grinderino or something??","the RM pocket is probably better if i had to guess. its not good *in comparison*. most people dont realize when we say something isnt good, its completely relative Does 1950kv motors work ok/well with 6s battery you just don't want to use 4s for freestyle. or racing for that matter hey, so i've talked a good bit abt my 3.5"" 4s build (it's pretty standard, 1804 motors, flyfish volador, expectred weight around 280-300g). I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what sort of performance I could expect from it and how i should find a drone in liftoff that's at all close to how it would likely actually fly I doubt you'll find a drone that's similar to it in Liftoff but it shouldn't matter. it'll most likely fly close-ish to a 6s 1750kV 5"". maybe with some more sag lol"
why is that?? Also could i ask what sim you use?,i don't sim. but Velocidrone Liftoff might have something on the marketplace but otherwise I don't think they have literally anything modern
is velocidrone like more modern?,in a way yes. it is more actively updated than liftoff is. and they have more quads you would think of nowadays oh ok. i mean i've already done like 70 hrs in liftoff so i dont think im gonna change sims now lol. velicodrone looks expensive. but that's good to know same price as liftoff is. 20 bucks. with the dlc its so much better. ive tried both
really?. ok. maybe i should just get it,"i also have like a kinda underpowered mac so idk how well it'll run i own it but have never actually played it. should probably run better than liftoff. but don't quote me on it oh wait it's not on steam oh it says ""this pack will need at least a discrete budget graphics gaming card"" means steam can't take 30% of profits for no reason for the freestyle one. that seems unlikely to run on a mac m2 lol bruh it'll run on a mac m2. ""underpowered mac"". has one of the fucking fanciest cpu's ever made. okay lol i was comparing it to like the beefy windows desktops ppl ahve. and it's the air. ok maybe i'm overthinking this yeah. still better cpu than most people have in those yea, i was mostly worried about the discrete gpu requirement you should be fine. they literally have specific downloads for the m2 yea ik, im just thinking about the freestyle dlc. fuck it, $20 is $20 loads of people here also have it. multiplayer sessions tend to happen more often on velocidrone than liftoff WAIT IT WANTS 55 GB!!!. LMAO WHAT THE HELL i have no idea, it says the recomended spec is 55gb free. i have 75gb free and it's giving me this error lol that's a lot of storage yea ik!. and like i should have way more than enough, there's no way it needs 81.12 GB. because that's clinically insane"
"Yeah, I am pretty sure its not 82gb of content. Try and relaunch it?",i just cleared a stupid amount of space since there're some things i dont rlly need. i'll try again one more time and then relaunch. rip to my 80gb of virtual instruments
"We are talking about ELRS here, right?. Not video stuff","Y’all so if I turn my Tx power up to 1w it won’t hurt my drone If it doesn't overheat no Yes. I’m talking about increasing my boxers output because right now it’s at 400mw or smth There's no need to have it blasting constant 1W all the time. That's why dynamic power is useful It automatically goes up to a higher transmitting power when the signal gets worse Oh I remember Emilia talking about that. Alrighty I’ll turn that on You can set an upper limit of dynamic power, to 1W if you want Then one more question, I feel like my antenna is super loose And no, 1W of TX power won't fry anything on the drone It can spin freely. That’s good. Hopefully changing that will help increase the range. Cause right now it’s kinda meh"
guys should i buy a really cheap whoop to crash into walls just to get indoor practice?. like not even goggles or anything. just buy a 50 dollar thing and fly inside with it,Probably not. Los flying is not the same as fpv Yall they havent released a 38.43.7. its only on the goggles and that shouldn't be why osd isn't working
how did you solder it?,"rx4. tx4. and power ground okay. but did you do rx to tx. and tx to rx yurm. lemme double check. it is good!. is 10v too low no. can you show the ports tab and the osd tab. well if you're sure your wiring is correct double triple checked ``` set osd_displayport_device = MSP set vcd_video_system = HD save ```. also don't let your vtx overheat like that. if that doesn't fix it. <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjAe9BV5mh7SHQbJG3kFP9X4qH2T7Gtg/view>. here's the latest firmware thansk!. is there any way to verify that the connection works at all Can i use a power bank to power fpv goggles Depends on the goggles. If they support 5v input Sky030 or the cobra x v4 as long as it has a camera that i can connect to my phone im fine, ive got a homemade headset thingy that holds my phone like a vr headset Ok yeah but no, cause the latency on this kind of thing is goddamn awful and basically unflyable, you would be better off just saving up and getting an actually decent setup what now. nothing wroking :dev:. is tehre anything to do in the vtx tab. I assumed that this was the wrong way. i see now!. makes sense. this jb fella is quite the fella"
whats a esc mosfet? and why are they selling it as a broken part :loudly_crying_face:,"And usually what motors/battery/props would they have It's an electrical switch, a couple of them make each motor spin. Apparently they blow up often enough that they sell them as replacements"

Hey guys I'm just wondering does it matter if I just cut ends off jst-xh and extend the wire and use butt connectors or electrical tape? Because I need a much longer one then I seem tp be able to buy,"I can have a look at the specifics when I'm home Ok :thumbs_up:. Sorry for all the questions, I’m quite new but is it also possible to have a drone fly decently on both 4s and 6s batteries interchangeably I'm not sure, but you have to get a motor with the right kv so you have a weak 4s and strong 6s drone. But I haven't heard of someone doing this so far. Because why would you do this I already have 4s batteries and I really don’t want to spend too much money for another drone for 6s So what would the the drawbacks I guess"
"what is up with the whole elrs hz thing. I'm slightly familiar with sx1262 lora module that a lot of elrs modules use, which has a maximum bandwidth of 500khz. I keep seeing people refer to a refresh rate of 250hz and 500hz as well as lower values. This seems too similar to lora bandwidth standards of 250khz and 500khz. Are people getting hz and khz confused or is there something else im missing?",uhh when u run 6s u need lower kv motors like 1700kv or smth if u  run 4s ull need higher kv like 2750kv or smth so if u run 4s on 1700kv  ull need around 50-60% power JUST to hover so not a good idea but im still kinda new to the fpv world just clarify with others You can use 2000kv for a really fast 6s but I'm not sure how it would fly with 4s
uhh where do u find 2000kv motors that handle 6s?,Oh wait I'm actually using 1950. For 6s yea sounds good. its real high kv. i mean it would work with 4s but it would be kinda slow uk
"Wait, just to clarify, it's for a 5"", right?","I mean you could probably use 2100kv for a 6s 5"" racer, but it might still be too low for 4s. As far as I know the kv for 4s starts at around 2300 Ok. I’d 4s even able to fly on 1950kv Yeah also depends on the weight and so on And is it too strong for 6s 1950kv Something bad happens I really don’t know An average 650g 5"" can fly on 4S at 1700Kv or maybe even lower (haven't actually tried), it just isn't fun. The range for 4S builds is typically 2300-2600Kv. by the time you're into Kv ranges that high though, the torque efficiency in the motors just sucks Ok and should I get 2004 motors or some other one. The ones I’m looking at are 2207"
can a analog vtx be connected to this aio? https://www.drone-fpv-racer.com/en/f4-2-3s-20a-elrs-24g-aio-v1-by-betafpv-11872.html,"This AIO is not designed for analog FPV. It has no ports for analog gear, and has no MAX7456 chip to provide an OSD It's powerful, good for aggressive freestyle, 1700 should be enough for normal freestyle tho"
So the hz is more of a preset? If I remember correctly theres spread factor and coding rate and a couple of other things,Refresh rate refers to how many RC packets are sent per second. It is only related to LoRa bandwidth in that bandwidth is one of the RF parameters that determines data rate. Those things are not exposed to the end user. The packet rate *only* refers to the number of ELRS packets sent over the air per second. Everything else you're talking about is under the hood. Ok I think i understand. Thanks
"can a 20amp esc aio be used in a 3"" 4s or should i use 35amp?","Whats good abt the cobra xs. X That depends more on the motor and prop than the voltage And is there any thin goggles for around the same price Just what are the pros. And maybe some cons Technically yes, but they're absolute garbage if you're buying new ones. Some nice higher end goggles can be had for that price used"
size or kv of the motor?,"Sky02c is what ive found for similar price No need to apologize, it's just a bad choice. That's the problem Ok good to know. What high end ones should i look out for. Also where will i probs find these I can't tell you where to look, depends on your country. Wherever you would buy used things Anything that has at least a 720p resolution or larger. OLED isn't a must, but very nice. Generally you want it to come with a VRX and antennas"
Sky030?. Oh noooo they sold,iflight xing2 1404 4600kv with gemfan hurricane 3016 oh wait. 4600kv. where did i get those numbers from :loudly_crying_face:
"20a isnt enough, right?",iFlight tested those motors and got 18A at 16V on a 4030 prop. So if you use a smaller prop that has a lighter pitch it will be even more efficient

If you have it connected to full batteries, its sensing that and not pushing charge voltage into the cells any longer."
"shoot, where is the output pins?",The pads labeled in this pic are input. You would use thoose as an alternative to the USB voltage input.
"okay. so why do they make 35a versions for 4s?. like. im pretty sure that the configuration i have is more than enough and it still uses only under 20a. most 5"" drones dont have a aio","The side you connect to the batteries.  As said before. Try it with empty batteries and you'll probably notice it's good as you have it in that 1st pic. Most don't, some do. Also 4"" is a thing ok ok i get it, It was never not working then, I just thought these pins I just showed u (the alternative input) were the ouput @Llama  just want to make sure rq these two pins where I put the batteries are the same ill use to power whatever i want Oh, if you're trying to use this as a voltage booster/regulator. Then this might fight with you.  It's not really the ideal circuit for the job of creating a set voltage/amperage."

alright. its zero here. should I go straight up to 10% or in smaller steps like +1%?,smaller steps lol. this is throttle value

so binding/pairing it?,im pretty sure i got it binded but i dont know how to check and how to set up the arm bind connect your drone to betaflight and go to the receiver tab. move your sticks around and see if any of the bars move. as for arming press add range. then click the AUTO dropdown and move the switch you want. make it so that when you have the switch in the armed position the yellow marker is within in the yellow bar. and when it is in the unarmed position its outside of it. this is in the modes tab btw
have you set a bind phrase?,"or did you just press the bind button in the ELRS menu power on your receiver and dont connect the radio. wait for it to make a wifi network. connect to it. and set a bindphrase in the page it opens. as for setting the phrase on the radio im not sure how. i assume its in the ELRS menu do i conect with a laptop it can be whatever device. just connect to the wifi network it makes and it will open a page to configure it @Spooce for the radio it will be the same thing go in to the ELRS menu, go to wifi, and then enable wifi. the wifi password is ""expresslrs"" btw @Spooce. now you dont have to manually bind every time you power on the drone. it should automatically connect to your radio thanks. i was wondering"

See the module from Lumenier, for example"
Materials development to connect brain to drones! Does anyone here know where I can find the materials?,what. materials for what
Materials to connect your brain to a drone??,"i cant tell if its a non-english speaking research student or AI lmao Fly fast enough into ye head look at their bio. LapTop you can judge that lmao hey yall im tryna flash my betafpv aio elrs via wifi and its saying not enough space when i upload the file got a point there. also. ive got some go pro batteries right. they're 3.7 volts each i think. lithium ion but meh. could i pull those apart and solder them together to make a battery yes but i dont see why you would idk a lot of the stuff i do is cause i wanna id imagine the gopro casing is pretty tough, and those are pretty tiny batteries not for any decent reason yeah me too but im tellin you this wont be worth it lol its a real old one. hero3 plus. the batteries have like a little clip holding them shut i think. its these ones then in that case the battery is degraded and useless anyways lol. i have a hero 5 and its battery is shot the batteries are new ish"
a decade?. wait. it was released in 07. holy shit,"i think they might be 3rd party ones you can still buy 3rd party ones oh. well theyre probably still low quality then. you dont even have a use for said battery man ive got a box of random electronics that i dont have a use for. like. a big box. doesnt make much of a difference for me, if its got voltage i want it as do i. lol. ive started resorting into drawers im not that organised lmfao esk8 parts, fpv parts, wire, connectors... i have a microwave turntable motor lmao. ive got all the random stuff"
only one random motor? lol. edventually youll need a motor box,eventually. ive got 3 stripped down dodgy rc cars in there i think. i have almost no fpv equipment in there https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1076745221368455188/1302352003493658755/togif.gif holy shit im saving that
"defaults for my betafpv escs are 2s+ power rating but its a 1s esc, should i change it?",this needs to be a server sticker yes. make it a ! command but it deletes the persons message that typed the command iono howta do the bot things :PepeSadge:. I believe unit is doing those but i'm sure hes busy. lots of other command requests recently lol
"can i use 0702 motors on a 2"" or are they too small?","Verify that the goggles and VTX are on the exact same frequency. Too small okay. ive wanted to do a super fast 1s 2"" with 40000kv motors but i guess im gonna use them in the 1.6"" toothpick then 40000 is a ridiculous notion"
How can I change frequency / see the frequency. And would a Lollipop 4+ antenna work instead of the defaults?,Is Odditty XI35 Pro 6s good 3.5 inch
Habe you enabled pit mode?,"On the drone itself yes, but I have not touched this part in betaflight"
Is it on or off in the menu?,"The menu you see in your goggles when you do the throttle left pitch up combination. If its on then you have to turn it off to fly, else you won't have the mW that you chose"
Do you mean the menu?,"On your video. The thing where you see battery voltage, height and whatever you enabled in the osd tab. You see it in your goggles. When both sticks are centered and your drone is disarmed, move the left stick to the left and the right stick up for half a second or something. There should be a menu in your goggles if you enabled smart audio They clearly don't have Smart Audio working, because the Device Ready flag on the VTX page is not green. And none of the fields are set. The VTX clearly isn't set up at all in Betaflight"
"I have only done this part, do I need to do ""Selected Mode"" also?","It looks fine for a cinewhoop Maybe because the battery wasnt plugged in You need to have all the stuff at the top configured, and you also need to have the correct port configured for Smart Audio on the Ports tab. The Mobeetle6 is a 65mm quad"
How do I know Channel and Band?,Watch jb videos about those things. Just choose one. And match it with your goggles
isnt the carbon frame a little bit smaller tho?,"You just pick one. These settings aren't telling Betaflight what the VTX is set to, it's telling Betaflight what to *tell the VTX* to go to. Every spec sheet I'm seeing says 65mm But truth be told I don't own one so I can't say for 100% sure"
What should the Pit mode frequnecy be?. this is the only thing i find about it,I think you can leave it at zero
this should be fine then?. (Not saved yet),"Yes. Make sure to set your goggles to band a channel 1 I can now move away like 2 meter instead of 10 centimer… Ok, *now* try going into the Betaflight OSD menu and setting your VTX power. You might still be stuck in pit mode No. This one. https://www.kiwiquads.co.nz/how-to-change-your-vtx-settings-in-betaflight-osd/ Yea. It should stay disarmed while you're in that menu"
Do you see the OSD elements on the screen like normal?,"I do see the antenna name ""Foxeer"""
Do you have a Foxeer camera?,"Then you do not have the Betaflight OSD set up at all If you restart the drone you should see the betaflight logo in your goggles, under the logo theres as text that says how you can access the menu This is coming from the camera itself and should be disabled using the Dpad board that came with the camera"
Have you connected the camera video output directly to the video input of the vtx or is there the fc in between?,That's correct. Try to enable some osd elements in betaflight and save them
What is the name of the thing that should be disabled with the Dpad?,Something like show name or something. Idk. Just look at the settings and try out
Does it show up in your goggles?,Uhmm. At the config tab
betaflight?. do you want a screenshot?,"Disable osd, save, look if it shows up in your goggles, if not, enable again and save"
Did not work but do I need to do something with this?,If you connect it to your camera a menu shows up where you can disable that foxeer text. You can't control the osd with it tho
"hmm, were?. on the main menu?","The menu should show up in your goggles If I click on the middle button on the camera button board thing, yes I see a menu. But I do not see any ""text"" option Idk I don't have that cam. This wont solve your main problem anyways. With the osd not showing up"
"You fly analog, right?","On the top right, select auto. Or ntsc/pal if you know what you're using Yes. You can find this with the menu that works with the dpad Hmm, does still not work Save, and try disabling and enabling osd in the config tab again. It could be that the osd is on when the slide is off"
Good. Could you access it with your radio?,"Very good. Go to features>vtx. There should be a few options, for example output power and pit mode If pit mode is enabled, you can disable it to get enough range for flying. I'd recommend you to assign a switch to enable/disable pit mode. You can do that in the modes tab right now I can only move 2 meters from my drone, and then I do not see anything"
Doesn't matter. Does it work?. Do you have more range?,"It still says ""on"" when I do the left stick to the right and click save and reboot Ok wait. Let me just turn on my drone. I'll record it btw, I have pit mode ""enabled"" on my fc with a solder bridge try this first. thats the correct way to save and exit"
which radio do you have?,"it's just personal preference. you an just use any 2 position switch you want. just dont pick the arm switch no, I mean like in the menu oh. just move the right stick to te left when youre at the pit mode line. I'd recommend you to assign a switch on your radio to it anyways, so you dont have to access the menu at all for changing pit mode broo, this is insane. it works I think. thanks! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: nice. finally. glad I could help I'm trying to get into fpv is there any cheap beginner drone rtf kits beside the beta fpv cetus light RTF Kits are usually have very low quality gear and you’ll get a much better experience getting better parts separately, i recommend [this](https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639) Would the newbee vr drone v2.5 work Definitely not, again RTF kits have very low quality gear that will likely break or provide a very bad experience Thats just another kit, you are better off getting a radio and goggles that you can use with any compatible drone. Please ask in here before ordering anything to save yourself some money. I wss dumb enough to not to that and spend stuff on either the wrong stuff or things i diddnt need Would it be cheaper to build a drone or buy a pre built one Hard to say, what i did was buy the goggles, radio and a prebuild drone. That meant that i only had to bind it to my radio and goggles and i could fly. This gave me the benefit of not having to start with a build but i did have a high performace quad What quad did you buy if you don't have the equipment, like a soldering iron, prebuilt is defenitely cheaper. if you know the basics of soldering an electronics its fun tho Lets face it though, stuff will break and you'll need to solder replacement parts on. Just get the gear at the start I have a wood burner bit im 90% sure it also has attachments for solder oh yeah right. forgot that. if it has no temperature control etc its a pain in the ass to solder with I started like that, dont recommend it. Id advise you to get a pinecil soldering iron. They're like €40 and last for years And dont buy the cheapest solder possible What drones would yall recommend"
What size would you like? Or do you not know,3 or 3.5. Also I would like it to be somewhat cheap sense I'm working on a tight budget What are some good rates to start with as a base for a fast snappy style of flying
Do you want to start out digital or analog? Do you know the difference? Whats the budget exactly?. Experiment. Its different for loads of people,What’s just a high rate to start with watch the JB vid about rates
https://youtu.be/Ql62iRkLX3s?si=HF6uxJmzzotMp8UG,"Just for a drone probably $100 also I would like to start on analog oh sry I was not responding to you You'll only get a whoop (without batteries and charger) for that money anyways, good that youve done it If your realy on a budget look into the, air65 whoop, radiomaster pocket and eachine ev800d and the vifly whoopstor Is the air65 the betafpv one.

"betafpv 5in1 flickers something awful. correct freq, div mode on the vrx, tried multiple power levels and channels. any ideas?",these will fit 2207 motors right. nevermind i need M5. is there any benefit to this design over regular standoffs i want to get them for my back standoffs too but they only sell 23mm and i need 22mm :PepeSadge:
are the skyzone sky02c OLED?,Oh right. Have you got that but for the 02Os i assume the specs are the same. thats the description for the 02c listing. not sure why it says O2O
anyone know if the dji n3 goggles are compatable with the o3 fpv system?,"Im planning on a building a ten inch quad soon, I want to build my own lion packs with it as well. Im not sure what a good target weight would be for the packs.. The drone is probably going to be 300-500 grams dry."
why does my video that i record from the eachine ev800d have a lot of white flashes?,"ill prob like email them and lyk since its so new that a good Idea there was a chart floating around about it thats reasuring. that flight sim part may be a deal breaker Goggles with flight sims in useless IMO The specs look very similar to the G3s I might get a set with the new 04 air units coming out,. Ill probably still hang onto my v2s tho. yeah im tryna get into fpv so this will be my first pair if it supports other drones. thats a deal breaker Walk snail is a good option. Or used goggles v2 do you know which ones are best with glasses (im basically blind) Does betafpv configurator have any way of configuring a non betafpv transmitter to a cetus pro"
Any other suggestions?,"Dude just fucking accept you got horrible equipment. Sell it and buy something new About to buy all the parts I need, to build an fpv drone, can anyone tell me what I'm missing based on these pictures Alright. That esc is horrible The v4 is slightly better. Also those motors are for tinywhoops. You want a motor with a size at least 2207 Lemme look. Motors and stack need to be changed Hm. Also chopped off my receiver antenna Nothing else I can see, might wanna wait until someone with a bit more experience looks. But those motors will not work I'll make sure to chsnge those. Thanks you! Can prolly ask around. Not quite experienced enough to reccomend any unfortunately though Velox v3 is very recommended where do you live. pyrpdronme ships super fast nothing wrong with rdq either. but pyrodrone ships next day"
Is it free shipping tho?,"Pretty sure rdq does same day shipping as well i was told to get a t motor or skystars fc instead of speedybee. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) V4 works, just not amazingly. Yea. Way better"
So I should be all set then?,what goggles r u running. and do you already own them hear me out. walksnail. i may be biased when ecvetyhing was on sale it was 300 for moonlight plus goggles
I would but box googles make my eyes hurt after a good period of time. Is skyzone any good?,cobra x is very nice. or so ive heard welp i crashed the whoop and now it osscillates real bad during throttle pumps. no visible damage. i cannot figure this out. it appears to have fixed itself
"Should this sd card work for the integra goggles?. Because when I try to use them, I get an “SD card format” warning","Yes it should. Reformat the card as FAT32.

What size class?. What voltage?,eh the truerc one will be good i guess I'd get this https://geprc.com/product/gep-taker-g4-35a-aio/
"whats the ""but"" in it tho?","there needs to be a catch. it seems to good for its price no real downsides as far as I know, a bunch of people are happy with them *how tf is this better in any way and also cheaper than the truerc one* the 35A current rating is maybe a little higher than I'd want to run on it, but you said your motors pull 20A max why dont u just buy the aio u were using before... it's not better in every way. and GEPRC is a much bigger manufacturer than TuneRC just get a stack, if something breaks its cheaper to replace I can't seem to find the GEPRC AIOs in stock anywhere. The Skystars Jupiter AIO looks pretty nice 10"" wheelbase of 500mm I mean, regardless of size I would have suggested that 4.6:1 is not nearly enough for racing. An X-class 10"" should be maxxing at *least* 4kgF from each prop. That puts it in the same realm as 5"" racing rigs that are pushing T:W of at least 10:1. But, I mean, you can technically race anything you want The whole point of a toothpick is to be light, putting in a stack is the complete opposite of this mentality, and since with whoops you just have a single central stack that is pretty exposed, using a stack would make for basically a tower with props, which is not exactly ideal, especially when you will now need 3 quite heavy boards instead of just 2 facts. yea it can do max 3.2-3.3kgf per motor/prop at max, so not ideal Mine exploded when I first plugged it in (wiring was correct, but it was the first board I had to just litteraly explode when plugged in) stuff doesn't just explode on its own unless it's from Darwin FPV I find it mildly hard to believe that there was no fault in the soldering, no offense Manufacturing errors do still exist even if it's not from our beloved darwin (even if it's much more rare). I checked it a couple of times afterwards, the wiring was good, and nothing was bridged"
do you know what went pop?,"I have no idea, it just went boom, the capacitor on the leads was intact (and still in use), it was most definitely something under the heatsink. I'd assume there was some capacitors inside that didn't appreciate their existence and popped"
I can't fund my usb charger for my ev800 but I have the Battery charger cable can I just take a USB cable and make a charger myself?,"yea perhaps u dont want to use that cap anymore No it really is still good how do you even end up in that situation im so confused. but yes youcan, its recommended that youuse a breakout board. im psure that those goggles co,e with their own usb cable"
"what kind of port is it on the goggle?\. usb a or usb c. show me what is currently on the other end of that cable]. it is possible, make sure that you dont need that cable for anything else though. cause i havent seen that connector(red). oh also dont plug ur usb thing into above 5v. so charge only via ur laptop/pc usb port that u know is at 5v. cause if u go higher u wil fry the charging module on ur goggles","yw, though out of my curiosity, how many pins are on that red connector (there should be only two) yeah is 2 one red one black ye then ur good, though i really dont recomend modifying these cables(incase u need to rma the unit) u can go ahead if u feel like it. chances are that you can find one of those dc connectos in the trash somewhere or from an alarm clokc or something and u modify that instead ok thank you i will try that fist"
so the cable u have is the battery charger yes. ?. and ur missing the usb charger,"yes. i dont have the battery you wouldnt happen to have a 3d printer though right instead of cutting open the battery cable, 3d print a connector that connects to battery cable (may take a few tries) and cut open a usb connector(and u put the other side on the 3d printed connector). ur basically 3d printing a 2 pin female connector. or steal a connector off an old computer. much lesser damage than cutting open the battery cable ok I will try  sound hard but ok Thank you again yw, btw u can probably find the connector stl file online somewhere. good luck!"
"so my quad has 1 motor acting up, it spins but not properrly, like it spins then slows down repeat. Then the ESC beeps like twice everytime I release throtthle, why?","Sounds like possibly a faulty ESC how though, I baby it"
Have you done any detective work yet to see if you can find a problem?,"nah It's hard, wanted to messure with a multimeter but uh, I conformor coated it so. Can't acces the pads. :/"
Does it spin normally by hand?,You need an oscilloscope to measure motor wires anyway. Check if you can connect to it in a configurator and if the signal wires are good she spins but sounds like she's rubbing against dirt. tryna open her up now
https://www.amazon.com/Gens-Balance-Charger-Battery-Charging/dp/B09R1PGPN3. this a good charger for a beginner?,"Eh it's OK. It should be reliable, it's from a good manufacturer, but the firmware and functionality is just outdated. I normally recommend the Hota H6 Pro or D6 Pro"
@Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) can I borrow your expertise again?. I am targeting a 52g frame weight itll be this with the same frame underneath. same style as sub250 huma20 or lumenier frame,"Seems like an ok design for the top plate, not really what I would have gone with but it should work fine Nothing *needs* to change, but I much prefer this type of cinewhoop frame. (it's the hedgehog from rubberquads, I love those guys's work)"
does the props down actually help?. geprc advertise it being more stable. and more efficient. i cant feel any difference other than reduce control authority,"Well, the theory wants that a pusher has better efficiency and stability than a puller since the airflow isn't obstructed at all, practice says that it doesn't actually matter much I cant seem to find a definite answer for this but are the skyzone sky02c OLED Also, some quick changes if you want to stick to this design (personally I do recommend doing one like the one I showed before as it can be made lighter and imo it looks sexier) you could change the number of supports on the motor mount from 4 to 3, and on the bottom half, only have the bare minimum necessary for the structural integrity (so no motor mount or supports inside of the prop guards, otherwise you would be kind of ruining the only theocratical advantage of a pusher, except if you want to go x8) otherwise it should be fine. No, skyzone's OLED series is named xy**o**. But again, get the cobra x v4 doesn't matter, don't get them Whats the i think its refresh rate on the cobra x Same as basically any other analog goggles, 60fps (since analog is 30i, even if we are getting a couple of goggles that are 100hz for HDZ/walksnail) I feel im going to hurt my eyes with the box goggles cause its all across the screen cause of the way i look at things And is using a carbon guard lighter and better than using say a printer or injection molded gaurd. With plastic or foam. I assume it's lighter and helps with structural integrity Yeah, carbon fiber is great for prop guards, only reason to print them or use plastic ones is for using ducts, which is not the same thing. But you're not going to, they have lenses inside and it's basically the same as using low profile goggles. Only the old or really shitty goggles don't have lenses And with the rubber kwads frame what's the AUW and frame only weight.. And do the guards need to be covering the centre of the prop and up or will it stop me from damaging people or props by having it in the general region. Also could you suggest any other similar frames https://shop.rubberquads.com/products/hedgehog-25. You do need to have them at around the tip or a bit higher, and using prop guards shouldn't be about making your props last longer, but just if you want to shoot cinematic next to people or cars or just stuff you will need to fly close to and that you can't afford to crash into, otherwise, a cinewhoop is kind of just a worse ""normal"" quad Ye I'll be following things quite close I phrased it wrong. Essentially I don't want the props to hit the subject in question."
Attitude v6?. Better than cobrax or no,Ok thks. What battery should i get for the cobra x
is there any way to have OSD elements that dont show up when flying but show up on DVR?. walksnail if it matters,"It absolutely does. Walksnail DVR only records the OSD elements that are on the screen You can do the opposite, where you have an OSD element on screen and then mask it using the Walksnail OSD rendering tool so that it doesn't show in the final video. There *are* other tools that allow you to overlay telemetry input on a video, so you could record the data to a blackbox log, and pipe that through the rendering utility to get it on the final video. The old free tool for that was called Dashware, but it's finicky as hell. There is a tool out now that is *sort of* easier to use that's just called ""Telemetry Overlay"" but it'll cost you"
do you have any experience with it?. all i really care about is getting my stick positions overlayed. not exactly sure how well BF handles it,Oh hang on. There's a tool for that

It's the 2mm bottom plate ?,"Guys any tips how to shave some weight from the fractal with aio5. Aside from shortening camera wires I don’t see much options Well now most of the extra weight comes from the frame itself, so you can either go with an air75 frame, put the ducts of an air75 frame on, remove the ducts or just chop them off like this, which will keep basically all of the durability and shave off plastic that wasn't doing anything I was thinking of the duct chop. Got couple spare mob75 frames so even if I need to replace them it’s fine. And yeah it’s the thicker carbon frame, guess just can’t avoid the weight penalty You could also go with the hq ul 40mmx2 and save .2g. But it will also change the flight characteristics quite significantly I really like how it flies now, wouldn’t wana mess with that Well, here's another place to save weight. It's not like you will break the 1.5mm plate anyway. You could also shorten the motor wires while shortening the camera wires The only issue is that I’m in uk, it takes long and shipping is pricey to get fractal stuff there"
There isn't local stores that carries the frame ?. Or else you could get them from the eu,"I do not see any, think the move is to order couple of them from states and pay once for shipping Or from the eu, shipping would probably be cheaper. Also you could get some titanium (2 per motors) or reny screws (3 screws per motors, and for the front 2 motors you add one titanium screw to the front screw hole) and drop half a gram easily Oh ye, screws, I run 2 per motor. Standard steel ones Steel is rather heavy, if you want to save weight, titanium and reny is the best option. And if you are also using steel screws to hold down the fc, you can also get reny screws for that. And you will probably save a good gram by just swapping all the screws Okay I’m at 23.7 with ducts chopped. Let me look how screw situation looks like. For fc I use those cheap China plastic ones. Motors are the happymodel 0802 25000s with 1mm shaft"
"Could you weight them ?. Well, you aren't going to save much extra weight here","That’s exact stuff I have on my drone right now. 4 screws with 2 washers each, one nut on each wirh rubber thingie. Im comparing to others peoples builds and there doesnt seem to be much weight to gain"

The goggles don't support av out while also accepting hdmi in. ah i c, should work with an external analog vrx though. though not a good idea, i think ill just display my feed on my laptop Yes. Also note that analog‐>PC will likely incur a latency for the conversion. Often the delay is too much to actually fly on."
"ah, you mean a quad FC?","you need an OSD chip. that or physical gauges in front of the camera hehe see im using like an individual motor esc for the throttle.   I can control this directly from my receiver  I dont want to get a whole fc etc for this plane as im new, i want to just get a speed reading and a video feed. this isnt on an elrs thing btw there are very few OSD boards nowadays because every FC has one. irrelevant. so you have to either figure out a pixhawk or KISS osd board, or just stick a 7-segment in front fo the camera too expensive, physical gauges seem to be my best bet for now. or i can put a accelerometer with a led display in front of my camera. Okay then what is the cheapest fc lol, on robu preferably. max i can spend is like 30 usd. about 2500 inr cheapest worth actually getting I think is a speedybee wing mini, MSRP is about $35 if I recall correctly out of stock :loudly_crying_face: unfortunately it seems India has The Big Oof when it comes to these things yep. how can i use a f405 speedybee with this type of esc: https://robu.in/product/emax-simon-k-series-multirotor-60a-brushless-esc-original/ ok perfect, ill save for that fc no i need it for a fixed wing, its a quad fc though ah. I think betaflight can output pwm instead of dshot"
Is having the two antennas cross like this going to cause issues? Or is it only when the ends of the antennas are together?,"Well, technically the vtx antenna can mess up with the internals of the Rx, in theory, but it should be fine Idk about the rx as much as the vtx. Well fingers crossed all goes well tomorrow"
"On another topic, I destroyed my second battery gnb flower 1300mah today and i got left with 2 more, so im looking to buy some new ones. What do you think about this batteries? Is there a better option in the same price?","Nah. They're just rubber protector things. Pull the other one off so it matches, job done :thumbs_up: Fixed :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: Noice. ""That'll do pig."""
"so this drone i built seems to fly broadly quite well, but is very difficult to control... can anyone make a quick and dirty recommendation for how to make it ""easier"" to fly? * speedybee fs225 (5"") frame * f405 v3 50A stack * kv2000 rushfpv motors * 160C 6s 1500mAh lipo (dogcom) * nazgul f5 props  i'm contemplating switching down to kv1500 motors, in the hope that their lower top speed means they'll be a bit ""smoother"" to control... dunno if there's any other adjustment i should be considering either instead or as well.",Try a throttle cap or expo or a motor RPM limit.
what do you mean by difficult to control?,"2000Kv on 6S motors is a recipe for crazy speed. No wonder it's hard for you to control. this was from when i flew it last year, just trying to get it to sit at some level is near impossible, and it's extremely ""twitchy"" (didn't get much video footage, but i'm moving the controls *very* lightly and it's going up very quickly) If you're expecting a fully manual FPV drone to just hover in place by itself, you have the wrong idea. Staying in ground-effect makes it worse"
is this your first quad?,then your throttle control just sucks. it will get better with practice and putting expo on the throttle will help (although i don't recommend it on an acro quad) the twitchyness is just too high rates i bet
"my throttle control is basically non-existent, aside from a dji neo i bought recently i've never really flown a drone :grinning_face_with_sweat:. expo presumably is exponential increments on the controls?. so you move the stick from 0% to 10%, you get 1% more throttle, but move it from 90% to 100% and you get 50% or something?","Manual throttle control is an essential skill regardless of if you're flying fpv or los. There's no need for you to change your motors, all of this can be helped by adjusting your rates and throttle limits"
You ever flown a simulator for a quad?,"yes, making it steeper at top/bottom but making it flatter around the hover point i did hook up the t-pro to a simulator and it was ""not too bad"", but then i wasn't flying around a stack of lipos so was less concerned about being exploded. easier to have confidence in those circumstances"
"Which simulator, if I may?  Some are very representative of real flight, others... less so.","Aka, if you don't have velocidrone, get velocidrone Some are so realistic that you can play with what is known as ""rates"" and then port them over to the drone itself and it'll react largely the same.  ""Rates"" are the rate the quad rotates for a given stick input.. High rates means high rate of rotation and therefore higher difficulty (at least at first) of control.. As @Aymeric(PEEK Sucks) says, Velocidrone is the recommended simulator. It has the most realistic physics and flight dynamics of all the sims available. ie. It feels the most like real life.  It will give you a much better idea of what to expect from a given class of quad, and can be used for training before flight.. It will definitely teach you the throttle control to be able to handle your quad. :yellow_heart:"
"trying to find the simulators in my steam library but there's too much :face_with_tears_of_joy:. can have a crack at velocidrone though. in terms of throttle limits and whatnot, presumably needs to be configured in betaflight?","Velocidrone isn't on steam BTW. Has it's own website please tell me it's mac friendly I have no clue :sad_but_relieved_face: seems to suggest it is Oh, cool. That's a relief. at least they list OSX requirements on the site, so :crossed_fingers: it'll just work (inc metal, so apple silicone should be good) As for limits in Betaflight, etc. I can't help you there. I am not a fan of limiting quads, only to have to relearn how it flies when you move the limits.. Thus, I've never done it, and can't remember where the options are :KEKw: It's in the pid tuning tab->rates Honestly sounds like you just need a larger space to fly and practice in. Idk if betaflight supports rpm limit out of the box tho that'll be the badger this is likely true, but i'm kinda agoraphobic so being able to practice with any frequency is a bit of a pain in the ass"
"UK, right? Where exactly?. I'm in Sheffield, you anywhere near?","little village north of Cambridge also very awkward to find anywhere to actually fly here. surrounded by damned military bases One day I'll find someone in Sheffield to fly with :PepeKEKcry: there are 4 roads into/out of my village, 3 of them lead to RAF bases within 5 miles. :grinning_face_with_sweat:. if i ever get back to my former self there's every chance i'll be mooching about all over the place again. pre-COVID i was travelling to a different city every week of the year for various meetings and whatnot. appreciate the effort that's gone in here btw, supposed to be a channel for quick questions, ended up not being a very quick question :face_with_tears_of_joy:"

Any of you ever have a flickering video feed when powering via USB? Works fine via the batteries.,"if i had to guess thats just because the usb cant provide enough power Or it's getting electrical noise from the rest of the computer system. Either way, if it's not doing it while you're on lipo power, then there's no real problem Probably. Just confused because it works fine with my 1S boards well yeah, those take way less power If you're getting video from USB power on anything but a tinywhoop AIO, there's something very wrong It's a 2S board.

assuming i went with 20k do you think i could get atleast a 2 minute flight?. i know the higher kv the more power it takes and i got 550mah batteries,"how practical would a crazy 1s drone be. like 20,000kv motors. id swap the motors on my current micro but idk if the AIO can handle the power demand meant 40,000kv. idk why i thought we bleed fpv's highest one was 20k Above 27kv is kinda dumb, the wires are already too thin for the current they want 20kv is pretty low, youd have to build a pretty shit whoop to not get 20 min with 20k kv Probably would have been a good idea to check the kV of my micro drone motors lol. Its got 23,500"

I see. the third black wire. darn if the batteries arent identical, they will discharge extremely unevenly. Even perfectly identical batteries discharge slightly unevenly, but the charger should balance it out every cycle. yeah ah flipping flip thank u so much, so putting that third wire will make it even"
"it isnt good u said?. uh I dont know. but it should?. it has over 300 review and says it works good, if i just put the wires correct",well i dont think it does...
it doesnt have the individual charging?,on aliexpress i dont ever trust the reviews. it sure doesnt look like it. i dont see somewhere to add another wire. see how the other boards have 3 pads and not two
"so for this img, is the redfilled wire the charging one?","no.... red just means positive no like. that output thing oh. no thats discharge hold on tho, you gotta realize. a single cell only has two connections. positive and negative thats it. you can charge or discharge the battery from them"
so what ur saying is this board is wrong or smth?,"there is no ""discharge wire"" and ""charge wire"" or anything like that yeah i think you have a really low quality board tbh"
yeah i get that. could u link me a to trusted good one?,"ok just making sure lol. for discharging that red connector usually has thicker wires and its longer for discharging, but you can technically do it through whatever wire. the battery doesnt care"
"also just to make sure I understand, this shouldn't be able to charge?","that will charge, but it cant charge them evenly it has no way to know how full they are individually, only the total voltage. the added wire in the middle tells charger what the voltage of each cell is and lets it balance them"
I need smth like this?,"thats why those huge 6s batteries have lots of pins in the balance connector, one wire per cell. yes. the pad design is a little strange on that one lol, but yeah. i linked some above as well"
"ok, but a BMS wont do the charging as far as I know?. oh 1 sec. uh","uhhhh ""BMS"" as far as i know is supposed to take dc voltage and charge the battery. so it should. but you need a balancing bms. uhhhh whaaaat oh, someone said the bms was just for protection and a charging board charger or something. ok got it. ill try finding that https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800598991528.html. https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803470077839.html ok that works, but there's no charing port"

"the ESC can only support 2s to 6s since its 30amp, so 22000mah 6s?","the bottom here shows you that the two pads on each side are connected, and the center one is BM. BM just means battery management. its fine"
"ok perfect, are the bigger ones on the left and right extra or smth?","again, i have no idea. first, 30a has nothing to do with the voltage, and second 22000mah is huge. third, i still dont know what size your hex is.. yeah theyre literally just a bit bigger, it doesnt matter which one you solder to lol. i wanted to make sure that wouldnt confuse you xd. theyre the same pad internally yup tyy, Ill order this like now and hopefuly it comes soon, and then I can test it :thumbs_up:. it also says this will charge your battery at 1.5a, which should be pretty safe for 18650s rq I found this cheaper one, almost identical. got more review too @Hydranceyou can solder to the middle three pads, and then your outer two could be your output. nice and easy soldering so nevermind, the frame suggests 3s to 4s its the same one, you can just get that. dude the frame literally doesnt give a damn what the battery voltage is. you are not looking at the right things"
"your motor KV and prop size/pitch are what you use to decide voltage, then you decide capacity based on weight. a given KV spins a specific speed at a given voltage, and then you need a prop thats efficient at that speed. then you can pick an esc thats rated for the voltage and amperage you want. why are you making a hex? that sounds way more complicated than you should be dealing with",it sounds like its gonna be more frusterating than fun lol. build a quad. and not a huge one
"oh just 1 last thing I realised, disregarding the charging, after emptying the batteries normal using the plus minus thing, one of the battery is 4v while the other is 1v, should that have had happened?","then you can go bigger I just did though. now I am bored, I wanted to be in some really advanced stuff like autonomous system 1v is deader than dead. they shouldnt ever ever go below 2.5v or you kinda damage them.. its not totally shot but they degrade over time when theyre that low. they should stay at the same voltage. if you hook them both up to the charger now, it will start charging them at the same pace and it will overcharge the 4v one because the 1v one is so low. this is the #1 way to start a fire. you can do that on a quad. gps and compass on inav on a 5"" or a 7"" if youre really stuck on long flight times itll be a lot eaiser ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. and cheaper yeah but I liked making my life harder oh.. im going to recharge them using another proper charger that does it seperately (i unsoldered hte batteires and stuff) and get them to equal because life is pain in the ass"
should that have it ready for the proper BMS?,"plus I am already going to be in college so I might get in a project where we have to build a hexacopter drone project alr, thanks once again, i can finally have a good night rest @-Mythical-use rotor builds to find some similar sized quads and copy their props/motors/batteries https://rotorbuilds.com/build/14879. this is an old one but the numbers still gotta match correctly. lol no problem Hello there fellow build-beeg-drone-for-fun enjoyer am I part of the gang :pepechadge:. we need our own channel or smth I would if it didn't cost so much lmao.

Did you just not read my message ?,Then you can answer it yourself But ministars also 70C
"Again, did you not read my message ? (Also the ministars are pretty budget batteries for micros)","alr so I'd choose pizzas one Comparing C rating between manufacturers mostly bs. You can somewhat compare C rating between batteries from the same manufacturer, but for the most part it's marketing crap. It'll give you an idea of how the battery will perform, but it's not an actual standardized specification i actually bought a set, theyre an interesting idea. on one hand, you dont blow up escs as easily, in theory, because instead of your props catching on stuff they just fold back. i really liked the idea because i was thinking they would fold up nicer in a bag, and I'm a fan of being able to show up on location, fly one pack, and leave without messing with props and I wanted the quad in my bag. The downsides don't seem to atrocious but theyre there. I haven't noticed it myself, but I think theyre heavier, theyre probably not balanced as well, and theyre so tall my nuts dont go on all the way. Theyre cool but theyre niche and I wound up not using them. interestin. better ask dji people. we'rw no dji people. we do real fpv #camera-drones or online forums. Theres a whole dji forum. that is entirely relative. i just flew a quad for less than 2.5 minutes earlier 3.5-4.5 is probably average for fpv, but the DJIs can go like 40 Which is how we end with some 70c batteries that perform better than some 160c batteries (i.e the tattu 1s compared to the emax 1s). For fpv or camera drones (camera drones being stuff like DJI/autel) If those are my drl rates how do I get my rate like that on my drone in btaflight blurriest pic ever. you might need to use a converter Most camera drones can fly for like 20-30min. But that's not the main thing you should look at honestly. Motion blur isn't enough, now you also need static blur That’s why they have telemetry. You can see the charge level That's why you check the battery % and come back before it looses power, and with DJI type quads I'm pretty sure they just turn back on their own once the battery is too low But since I am an fpv elitist who doesn't give two craps about camera drones (and so are most people in this channel) you should really go over to #camera-drones , and since you asked about the neo over there, don't get it, it sucks. No worries, just don't go waste your money on the neo. Well, it would be rather challenging to know when to land otherwise (In the before days we used to do it by just having a clock, but that has a lot of glaring issues) Neo is a very meh drone It's stupidly heavy for it's size, which makes it completely underpowered and unresponsive/not exactly agile, which is not what you want for a drone that advertises acro capabilities (like an fpv drone), and the camera is just really crappy. Welcome to marketing It's ""light weight"" when you compare it to camera drones that are way bigger, so yeah it's going to be light compared to a DJI mini 3, but the mini 3 is a 5"" drone, the neo is a 2"" drone (5"" and 2"" referring to the prop diameter, not the size of the frame) so obviously it's going to be lighter, now if you compare the disk loading (weight/total prop surface area, the higher it is, the more it flies like a chonky potato, and the lower it is, the floatier it handles) to other fpv quads of the same size, you really that it really is a chonky potato, and you can see it in the videos of it,  But it's an ok toy (because it really is just a toy) if you want it to follow you and do nothing else. And just go watch videos of the video feed (please set in 4k to have the least compression YouTube will allow you), it looks like utter garbage, especially since the video you will see yourself in your phone/goggles will be even worse than that The crux35 walksnail is 260… Eh, depends on your definition of exploring, if you want to go exploring, at ground level, with 1km between you and the quad, you are going to have a lot of obstacles in the way, and you are going to loose signal very very fast (penetration is not range ||well technically it is but penetration is much much much lower than the range in a los test||) now if you want to watch from above  (Also I'm assuming you want a camera drone) while having a more or less line of sight operation (not necessarily for legal reason, just to not loose the video signal as fast) then go get something like a used DJI mini 2. (didn't read it right). But usually it is like 200 bucks. So you are getting very screwed over if you get a 400$ used mini 2. Also I'm assuming USD, if you live in Canada or Australia with monopoly money, that's a different story. I have no clues what the pricing is over there, but a used DJI mini 2 is the cheapest way to get a decent camera drone. There isn't really any good cheaper options"
could I use FrSky antennas for elrs recievers?. I found an old frsky receiver but I can't use it and I dont want to use it. so I thought I could use at least the antennas maybe,"A 2.4ghz antenna is a 2.4ghz antenna. Though receivers already come with antennas you’d just use those okay thanks. I'd keep them as spares Yo would this work for a elrs beginner setup ""work"" sure. but it'd break very quickly. and it isn't officially supported so you won't get any help with it. check out this thread. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144567226670788639 I've already looked at the list. Are there anything like.the stuff on the list that are cheaper. 300 USD is the bare minimum you need to spend for goggles + drone + transmitter + charger + batteries. it's always going to end up that way no matter what. 70 usd is the price of the RadioMaster Pocket"
so one is flashing in beta flight and one is wifi for ELRS at least right?,"Jhmcu is so fucked that even the am32 developers cant help me fix it haha, common jhmcu W I see you've been in the call for ages lol Yeah they're realy nice people alka even offered to send me a different am32 esc average jhemcu moment"
how important is the ham radio license?. for over 250g or for sub 250?,just go to oscarliang site. should have all tutorials
"you know the link to that?. i think i found it, i did not knew about this website","When transmitting 5.8ghz video, going over 25mw legally requires a ham radio license https://oscarliang.com https://www.fpvknowitall.com also a good site"
do torch lighters use batteries to creat whatever spark is needed to get the flame going. trying to look for one for heatshrink but dont want to have something i cant replace in it. do cops and all really care about it?,"to my knowledge, no drone pilot has been punished for transmitting >25mw without a license"
You mean the cheap flame lighters?. Or like a refillable butane torch?,"Fillable butane. but still cheap. $6 iirc the whole 25mw thing is a common misconception and is illegal regardless I believe it's a piezo striker, I've never heard of one breaking. Yea it's based on dbi and is actually *way* lower than 25mW im open to donations to burn. though i do suppose i have the AIO on my micro drone. i hate how stupidly hot it gets with the built in analog transmitter Found the source I remembered. FCC Part 15.249 restricts 5.8GHz band usage to 50mV/meter, which apparently works out to 0.45mW.  https://www.flitetest.com/articles/fpv-the-fcc-and-amateur-radio-makes-three Pit mode might be legal :face_with_tears_of_joy: per meter. i wish it was .50mW per meter. the further you fly the more output power you may use :misc_nod_bugcat:"

If you have any questions after reading that please ask any cheaper option will cost you more than that guide's minimum (300) in the long run. and FPV isn't a ""cheap"" hobby. sadly anything cheaper then the stuff on the list is most likley gonna be not that fun gotchas. so better to just save up rather than buying junk that ill just throw away yes. and those kits are always horrible"
"im in australia, and looking at some local retailers, is 209.99AUD good for the EV800D's?",that feels expensive. lemme convert to usd that seems about right iirc ok cause for me it would be nice to buy local yup. what localshop are you buyingh from https://www.fpvfaster.com.au/. just found this site no they should be about 100USD don't know if you have import tax or something the place he sent is in sydney. dunmno if i like it having a bunch of kits on the first oage but ehhhh. oh god this place is overpriced. 123 for a air65

"Touch wood, never broken a cam or VTX. You can do that?. There should be a spare RX and TX pad, in which case your fine and can switch to walksnail","there are a lot of those Just get a little voltage adapter and solder it to ur xt60 that’s exactly what I did on my Nazgul. No need for a 9V. You basically make a 9V Ah you can’t quite see but I put a Nazgûl in a VX5 with a HD pro. And just hid the step down thingy in the front camera cage yea i was looking at those volador frames, was tempted to do the same thing you did later on Cause there is a fuck tone of room in there. My fav frame. Just need to build the 3,5”   And maybe the 7” when it comes out and I got the full set  VX5 VD5  Ironically both gutted Nazgûl’s. If you do, you need to buy some m2 nylon nuts cause the holes in the VX5 are for an m3 stack, but just put the m2 screws through from the Nazgûl and tighten them down into the carbon with two nylon nuts to keep it sturdy. See the two white things at the bottom of my stack. Other than that it’s simple yea like standoffs. i was either gonna gut mine or just build the 3.5 and then do it from scratch. damn looking at the inside of your drone makign me want to clean mine out. like its hit the grass a few times recently Is it worth getting 2 tb or 4 tb in a computer if u are gonna work on real estate photography and building a portfolio.

We were all new once.. https://oscarliang.com/betaflight-cli-explained/#Checking-Settings-in-CLI. Helpful article on the Cli You can cut wires, thus you can also cut wires that happen to end up in a plug I had to refer to it to double check the command :KEKw: it looks like i have the latest firmware, but.. in the video i see when he updates theres a part where i need to find the boot bottom in my FC i think theres non. i have this https://oddityrc.com/products/f7-40a-aio-4-6s Boot button isn't usually necessary nowadays..

should i just not worry? cuz it did not went into DFU mode. after flashiong,"It did, or it wouldn't have flashed.. It'll reboot after flashing into normal mode. The process used to be more manual. Betaflight can reboot into DFU mode on command, requiring no user action."

"Do I rent them, or permanently own one?. And idk which one to get","^^. Can someone pls answer IMO If you really want to store a bunch of photos and other media it's better to have a NAS and store them there instead of on the computer itself What's a nas. I'm buying a pc, it's like 1600 bucks Network Attached Storage, it's like a remote storage server you can get a home NAS"
How?. I don't know how to make one or get one,"This is very google-able stuff if you can't go to that length, maybe you shouldn't be building a PC I can, I'm not building the pc tho. Prebuilt It has all specs I need then just get a decently large SSD/HDD for the computer I suppose"
Is 2 tb ssd enough?. That's how much my pc has right now. The one I'm gonna buy,"that entirely depends on what you plan to store. only you know how much storage you use Media and photos. Like videos. For drone real estate and portfolio building. :eyes:. I have a 128 gb micro sd in my drone. But I don't wanna upgrade tbh. And I just had a crash, few files corrupted there's only so much storage you can reasonably put inside a PC case, that's why a NAS might be the better futureproof option"
NAS what's the limit. And can I make a personalised?. When i come home I'll write up a small scheme of what I'll be doing and getting,completely depends on what you get... there are small 1-2 bay ones up to rack-mounted ones with up to like 60
Holy. How much does 1 hold?,"Usually they'd be standard 3.5"" drive bays, so pretty much anything that can fit into that format there are 20TB HDDs or even higher"

The camera size is also fairly standard I'm gonna work with the drone real estate. For 5-7 years What might be reasonable to me can be completely overkill, or barely enough for you How much. I'm gonna take pics and record in 4k 120 fps mostly so I have a 1TB main SSD in my PC and a 4TB HDD NAS downstairs. I use them for everything including movies, shows, games, and occasionally FPV DVR and GoPro footage. I have not ran out yet, but you might... If I were you I'd probably just get the higher capacity and see how fast you use it up, then you can buy according to that. any FC with a free UART port will work"

Yea I used their included one cause my Nazgûl one broke. The wires are the correct length. And motor wires are exactly the same length so literally drag and drop in new frame I trimmed about half an inch off the wire when I soldered the new XT60 btw. And it was perfect as you can see. Can do that or just cut it hmm ok, and do you have the 2 antenna walksnail or the single Otherwise you have to take the shrink wrap off and heat it and burn urself nnnnnehhhhhhhh  I just cut it right by the plug beneath the plug. Single, if you have a 3D printer you can mount the double. But single is easiest ye ai got the double coming rn And the antenna for the ELRS, just curve it round and tape it to the back arms. Yea If you don’t have a printer, pass both through the hole, connect them, screw them into the VTX, then see if there’s something to cable tie them to Do you think they can go through those small holes.

Guys the boot button on my fc got ripped off. What can i do to fix it?,Unless ur good at micro soldering not a lot. Can’t lie I’ve only once ever used a boot button. You’ll be fine. Betaflight does all the fancy stuff nowadays
can someone explain why every battery cell is fixed to 4.2 voltage?. why can not be a 10 voltage battery?. or a 8 votlage battery,Probably because of the chemistry of the LiPo battery cell
"okey i can accept that answer, are all lipo batteries 4.2 then? im never going to find a 6v batterie for exaple?. ty for your response","There are LiPos that are more than 4.2V of course, they're just more than 1 cell. Battery cells can be wired in series.. For example, if we say ""4S LiPo"", we refer to ""4 cells wired in series"", providing a maximum of 16.8V when fully charged. Also, the nominal voltage of a LiPo cell is 3.7V But the actual healthy voltage range is between 3V and 4.2V perfect. i was just wondering, because in my battery it says 22.2 V It's because you have a 6S LiPo battery, the nominal voltage of the whole battery is 22.2V i get it it nominal and not peak Correct, the peak, maximum voltage for a 6S battery is going to be 25.2V i was doing 6*4.2 and did not got a 22.2 Yeah because 4.2 is maximum safe voltage for each cell, adding up to 25.2V The nominal voltage of each LiPo cell is 3.7, adding up to the 22.2V Like with a lot of things in electronics... One value got popular and pretty much became the standard. If anyone does anything differently they're cut off from a massive part of the market. AFAIK there's no reason a LiPo battery couldn't be made to have a higher maximum voltage, but 4.2V max just slowly became the default. The nominal voltage of the LiPo represents the approximate 50% voltage"
im guessing here but then voltage is logaritmic right?,Not really. It's the middle point
"i mean, if nominal voltage is 50% should not be 2.1 volts?. insted of 3.7?","The minimum voltage is not 0V. 0V is dead. Under ~3.2V, the battery is permanently damaged okey i get it now, ty. it makes more sense this way What do I need on my osd for tinywhoops I’m using elrs Battery cell voltage is the only necessity. Id recommend putting LQ and core/cpu temp.. Anything else is personal preference Should I use link quality or rssi dbm. I do a lot of guerilla whooping Use either or both. LQ is better suited for elrs What’s the difference between them. Ok https://www.expresslrs.org/info/signal-health/ And what vtx output should I use. I get pretty good range on 25 but I haven’t changed it yet @Vitroid tagging you too because I want to clarify some things  The voltage range of a battery cell is determined by its chemistry.  A battery's chemistry maintains the difference in electrical potential (charge) between the electrodes (+ and -).  It also has to maintain the separation between these two ""sides"", properly shuffling charge from side to side without shorting out.   The chemical/physical parts that make up the battery can only take so much voltage before they become effectively a short-circuit. They also break down faster with increasing voltage, and this curve is pretty exponential.   4.2V was selected as the maximum charge voltage for lipos because it strikes a balance between longevity/stability/safety and capacity.  Any higher and they start to get pretty dangerous and short-lived. Some adjusted chemistries can go to like 4.5V. this really explains it TY"
quick question: can i use any analog vtx without a fc? do i just not connect the irc pad?,"Yeah, with caveats. That means no frequency or power control from the FC, for example. The VTx doesn't know when the quad gets armed either. in my use case, there is no fc So auto pit mode needs turning off or it won't ramp the power up on arming. Fair nuff.. Yeah, it's just a ""wireless camera"" at that point. this is exactly what i want Yeah, just feed it power. Configuration will be a bastard, but it can be done. See the manual for your VTx for how exactly. i have found a solution: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6388814"
"Can you explain why core temp is needed?. In my years of flying drones and FPV, never needed to know that during flight lol","wassup pookies, who needs some help I run lq, dbm, voltage, mah used, and a timer. tinywhoop aios with a vtx tend to overhead when sitting. i put pit mode on a switch. as long as you have a warning element on the osd, which it comes with by default, it will warn you at over 70c. i dont have a specific temp element tho i just use the warning I have set low power mode until first arm in the VTX tab and it works for me. Also I just fly shortly after plugging in."
wdym sticking? just for clarity sake,"Hey all! I'm having an issue with my FPV quad's throttle. When I initially tap the throttle, it responds, but as soon as I try to increase it further, the throttle seems to stick, and the quad doesn’t get off the ground. I tried reflashing the firmware, but it didn’t seem to help. Any guidance would be really appreciated!  Thanks for any advice you can give! Go through this very carefully (https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146), but my first inclination is that you have every single motor spinning the wrong way, and the quad is sucking itself onto the ground. like its stuck can't throttle down kk, just so others can know and help and know whatcha mean What's the highest your throttle goes No I mean I think all of the propellers are blowing the air *up* instead of down. It's literally pushing itself onto the ground"
"Out of curiosity. If I connected a 22.000Kv 1102 motors to a 2S battery, how high would I need to set the throttle cap? 50%? Or could I push it further?","You'd need to set a motor output limit, not just a throttle cap. 50% is appropriate though My bad. Mixed them up. The FC sends a throttle signal to each ESC in order to try to make the quad move. When the quad does not move how the FC expects it to, it *generally* applies more throttle. You cannot throttle down because you haven't set up your drone correctly."
should i chage propeller orientation to?,"I have seen GEPRC selling 18.000Kv motors with a 2s BNF and it got me thinking. Only if that is the correct fix. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Go through the FAQ I sent you."
guys will this be able to power on my radio master boxer?,"yes, but don't buy it off of amazon. like we said yesterday. just get it off of pyro or something, it's like half the price oh okay, and which charger do you reccomend the boxer can charge it. but if you need a big charger. look at the Hota T6 and the others listed here <https://vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging> ill buy this one then you need a power supply for it if you have an old laptop power supply you can make one. otherwise you can add an xt60 to any 20-24v psu off amazon. or you can buy one with an xt60 already on it, usually more expensive Or, instead of spending money on a PSU for a charger that doesn't have one, you can get the Hota D6 Pro that already has a PSU built-in. Or you can get the Hota H6, which is a single-channel charger with a PSU"

we're about to find out. tbs stuff is pretty quality too. did i say *good*? no. *high quality*. crossfire doesnt beat elrs but i still consider it pretty good quality,"same. i bought the straps. might as well try Well, many people had some of their stuff come in rusted, or break in a couple of weeks (not their fpv parts), and their motors are objectively bad welp. its 6 dollars whats the worst that can happen"
the ethix motors?. hmmmm,"no. not their new stuff. their vtx and receivers is all that is left what do they even make other than vtxs and rc link. ohhhh wait they have escs now. those are dog dookie arent they. thats true tango and mambo are completely and utterly abandoned, their flight stack is a proprietary disaster whats strange to me is that steele actually flies all this stuff. like he doesnt use elrs. you would think a pilot like that would deem it worth it to switch i think he has said that is it literally just because he has a ton of crossfire receivers lmfao. i could see it and also in this same video im remembering he also just kind of talks like an AMA field boomer about crossfire hes an fpv boomer now yupp so welp. maybe new stuff too hard still probably my favorite freestyle pilot ngl. but biggest tbs fanboy the top-class people always have the strongest preferences. usually because they just don't want to relearn anything Or else, he's just living a double life, where on his usual quads he flies elrs, and on his YouTube quads he flies crossfire to trick people into buying crossfire cause he would get a cut everytime someone buys crossfire stuff"

When I put the unit inside of the case, it fits snug. I'm also using it on slow RC cars rather than drones or wings with lots of wind, so I was wondering if that would also affect how long it can last without getting too hot.

With a parallel board it does matter.. @Scalise i cannot even find that wire on a product page listing if the cells are completely separate, it don't matter. If the cells are all interconnected, like in a multicell battery pack, then it very much does matter. In the case of a parallel board, it's basically a temporary way to connect all the cells into a single ""battery"" and therefore is like the case of being a single battery"
what range does the radiomaster pocket have?,"hey guys, i was wondering if you need both the transmitter and receiver to be 2.4G for it to be binded. i got a jumper tlite v2 and a geprc nano dual 900mhz and ive been trying to bind it for days but it just wont :pensive_face:. need help asap on this, sorry if its lengthy i could make it into a thread if needed 2.4GHz cannot talk to 900MHz. No there is no way to make it happen i seeee, tysm! very new to drones so mb You'll need a 2.4GHz receiver Thankfully, they're really cheap :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: as much as any other ELRS transmitter at 250mW. (40km is the record for 250mW I think)"
do the electronics support 6s?,"the FC and ESC are rated for 6s sure then, give it a shot the motor's KV are definitely too high for 6s I think at 3800, but I didn't know if a throttle limit would effectively make the motors run as if it was at 4s voltage, preventing any damage Following on this @OCEOLO996 and @Emilia (XT90 Janklet), I just did some flight testing with my 7"" (Walksnail Moonlight) with Walksnail VRX on my HDZ goggles. In normal 1080/60 mode, I can definitely feel the latency (Walksnail link delay ~32ms). I put it in 720/100 and switched to high bitrate (50mbps instead of 25) and felt *much* more comfortable with proximity flight. Normally the Walksnail link latency is ~32ms. In high bitrate low latency mode, the link latency was ~22-32ms. I can't quite *feel* the latency, so I assume it's a combination of factors.  Ultimately this, to me, just confirms what we already knew. Walksnail isn't going to be a system of choice for racers, ultra-proximity fliers, or folks that just can't stand the feeling of any latency at all."
but is the throttle limit really limiting the kv??,"thats what i dont know, idk if this makes it safe for the motors it doesn't limit the voltage or kv. it just makes them run slower for the given throttle command 3800Kv 3"" on 6S would be *crazy* fast, but as long as the motors stay cool and you PID tune appropriately, it should at least work"
"probably a dumb question, but less throttle means less voltage right?. does more throttle mean more voltage or more current?","So... yes and no. There's a couple of things to pick apart here. - A throttle limit only limits how much throttle *you* can apply, it does not limit how much throttle Betaflight's PID loop can apply - A motor output limit caps both your output and the PID loop's output - More throttle means more current the motor sizes are 1404 if that matters, but if my research leads me that throttle limit is not a ""make a 6s fly like a 4s"" option, I will give pid tuning a shot, just looking for ways to make max use of my batteries, with my one small drone i built for 4s and my larger one built for 6s And now for the complicated one. Throttle % equates to a ""duty cycle"", not voltage actually applied to the ESC/motor. The ESC always gets full VBAT. How much throttle you apply essentially tells the ESC how fast to switch that on and off to the motor more throttle makes the ESC change the phases quicker, and it draws more current oh yeah these are AC motors... I forgot (im dumb, phase changes are not the same thing as alternating current)"
does the esc draw more or the motor ?,"The motor itself is what draws current the ESC doesn't draw anything. it just lets the current through The ESC is the floodgate between the reservoir (battery) and the town you want to ~~flood~~ this makes sense, I at least know the esc is rated for 6s so that is safe, I just didnt know if 6s would burn up my motors"
so which parts draw more if the phraseses are timet shorter ?,"the motor draws all the current Dropping 6S on 4S motors can be a delicate process. I'd start with a motor output limit on a second PID profile, and incrementally stepping up and PID tuning as you go"
"Heh. So. Yes, no, maybe, and definitely. There are trade-offs with everything. So the first question is, are you expecting the same *performance* from it if you were to change out?","Im not expecting the same power, just max flight time, I dont really need high thrust or agility Ok so here's a fun curve ball the suspense is killing me Depending on the ESC you use, lower voltage might actually be more efficient in the whole system. While the motor *is* what draws the current, and P=I\*V means that higher voltage results in lower current at the same power *all else being equal*, when you switch to higher voltage all else is *not* equal in the entire system. The higher voltage *could* actually result in more power draw if the new voltage results in more power *loss* in the ESC's MOSFETs. You see, MOSFETs actually have a switching efficiency that varies with voltage.   *In my personal experience* optimizing for absolute run time, lower voltage has consistently been more efficient because it reduces power loss in the ESC, even at the cost of more amps in the motors.  Now, *my* 7"" build is too heavy for real long range, but on a 4S 5600mAh pack with 2812 1115Kv motors (AUW ~1kg) I get about 30 minutes of real flight time between take off and landing. *Meanwhile* that same quad on an 8S 2800mAh only gets about 20 minutes of real flight time. Now, part of that is because the 4S pack is li-ion and the 8S setup is lipo and li-ion can discharge lower than lipo, *and* the 8S setup is about 100g heavier. But still, a ten minute difference is large enough to be caused by more than just a few extra grams in weight. So if you're going for absolute run time, regardless of AUW, there's a specific target to look for. Thrust to weight needs to be as close to minimum as possible, 2.5:1 Im using speedybee's f405 v4 with the 60A heatsink esc, so the loss due to heat might be small. Thanks for those specifics, helps me in shopping, both my drones have had their motors picked out like throwing a dart, I have a general idea where it should be, but I dont know enough to pick out parts outside of the general guidelines i find online You can sort of gauge this starting with the propeller. Propeller thrust efficiency actually goes up with RPM, and prop thrust generation is actually *only* related to RPM, the motor it's on is completely inconsequential. So if you can find a thrust test that uses your propeller, you can gauge how much RPM you need, and back-calculate your Kv and such from there"
"would you recomend 2 or 3 blades for best efficiency? I've been told by the internet that more props are like more grip in the air which makes the motors work harder, like a car with big tires, but 2 props are like the super thin tires you see on efficient cars, less grip but also less drag. i assume 2 props will need more rpm to stay in the air though",Ha that's another interesting question. We're just highlighting how much I *really wish* prop manufacturers would publish RPM tests on their props
is there any brand that consistently does?,"So, if you're comparing a 2 blade and a 3 blade prop on the same motor at the same voltage with the same diameter, pitch, airfoil, *everything*, then the 2-blade propeller will be ""overall"" more efficient.  *However,* if you compare the actual thrust efficiency curve of props on a motor, and consider where you're going to spend most of your time with an LR build (mostly low throttle, hovering and cruising), there is a sweet spot of efficiency where more blades mean more thrust for fewer *watts* per RPM. For example, see this 5"" test I compiled a long time ago, which clearly demonstrated the efficiency of the HQ 5x4x3, but *only* in the bottom half of the throttle curve. Not that I've ever seen"
"5x4x3  means 5 inch diamter, 4 blades, and what does the last 3 mean?","5x4x3 means 5"" diameter, 4"" pitch, 3 blades"
ahh the pitch okay. and diatone 5x3 means 3 inch pitch 2 blades?,"For props that don't have a third number, assume 2 blades. Yes. BN is ""bull nose"" which is not something you see anymore lol just highlights how old this test is just trying to parse all the data sorry :grinning_face_with_sweat: But physics hasn't changed"
"so 2 props are more effecient at higher rpms like during take offs, but not for crusiing?",Not that we take off at high RPM in a quad
dont you need higher rpm to ascend than to maintain alt?. I guess to be as efficient as possible I'd just ascend really slowly,"Sure, if you want to go up like a rocket (sometimes its fun on my 3 inch) Oh it's definitely fun lol. Especially when you're demonstrating for innocent bystanders who blink and it's gone I am not confident enough to fly something as big as a 7 inch that fast loll. unless im really high up It has generally been my experience that more blades means more thrust for fewer watts at hover. Above a hover, all bets are off. So you have to consider the ability of the prop to generate thrust, and how much power it will take for the motor to turn that prop at that RPM so, in summary, I need around 11k-ish KV and probably a 2808-ish size, maybe more KV if im going with 2 props. for 4s Could. The problem there is that there is a general correlation between motor size and Kv. The lower the Kv, the larger the motor. You might have a hard time finding a 280x class motor with a Kv that low the lowest I see at first glance looks like 1300 That sounds about right which i guess would give more RPM to the 2 props, eh, I'll go for it, part of the fun is tinkering"
How can i check what packets rate I have in my quad in Betaflight ? or i just need to apply a preset ?,"I'll be damned. It's too bad I don't use APC props outside of airplanes. Thx for that will a 3A power bank  power my goggles depends on the watts not just the amps. and depends on the goggles too. but i'm assuming your plan on using usb, which is 5v, then you would have 15w, which will work on some goggles, but not on others, like say the hdz goggles that consume around 17w Pretty sure that’s a radio thing. On the boxer I just do: system > elrs > packet rate Yeah but i need to set them in the drone as well Don’t believe you need to do that"

r u gonna do a digital offshoot? site looks rlly good too. i made bad choices,"there would be no difference... you just get a digital kit instead of analog vtx/camera I'm on the road to it... I'll re-work the video equipment list, and then I can just link those items as needed. Though I am not familiar with digital much, I wouldn't want to make recommendations just for the sake of having something there its a Betafpv 2.4Ghz lite, aye a ken that when you connect it shows connected status as a solid led ( same with brocked RX) and if its not connected to TX it would keep blinking, in my case i would power everything up and it would just stay solid no matter what and for it to come back to working state i have to resolder 4/5V pad ( desolder and than solder back and that brings it back)"
What VTX do you have?,"i know that the RX is not bricked and in that case i have some experience getting them back to working order, but this one is been confusing me for past couple days. RX doesn't appear to be damaged in any away, and its wired up correctly so am lost."
Can you try to see if it boots up correctly when its UART lines are disconnected?,"yeap will do, when ill be home in like about 20min"
Have you unlocked it?. It might be limited to only certain frequencies when locked,"No, i dont think i did it"
can i connect an uart elrs receiver tot his crap?. like an ep1 rx,"Yes. But unless you already have that FC... Don't get it. Not for you, don't worry :grinning_face_with_sweat: i want something cheap to make a boat with directional steering Well... Sure. Maybe consider the BAYCK Dolphin if its better than thanks for the suggestion ah okay hahah, ill be back in two min and will try"
dang ive been tryna do something like that for ages. i was gonna see if i could do it arduino lmfao. anyone know if you could hook up servo motors instead of normal motors to drone components?,"you can. you know flight controllers are just micro controller boards right... like servos with 12kg of torque. yeah but its worth asking yeah put just the signal pwm wire, the power wires you connect to a power source aight thanks. might look into this more sometime am back and ive tried it, it powers up and kept doing its usual(blinking, waiting for signal) its just kinda randomly happens. First time it happened i just resoldered wiring and double checked that there is no loose wire or any damage and it looked all good"

"Hi, I just got my first ever tinywhoop(I'm new!) and it started snowing... Can i still go outside and play with it? Or will the snow damage it?","It *can* damage it. There are things you can do to stop that, but as this seems to be your first foray into FPV, I wouldn't recommend you try them yet. :yellow_heart:"
Did you get the PNP version?,I think I accidentally did lmao. Noob accident Yea you'll need a receiver then
"But it’s ok if I did , just don’t know what to buy for it. And would I mount the receiver somewhere ?",Personally I like Radiomaster RP2 receivers for stuff like this. Happymodel also sells a version called the EP2. And yea you can just use some double-sided tape and stick it somewhere
"Nice , thanks a lot main. Those don’t have any connectors tho from what I can see , would I have to solder it on ?","Yes you would need to solder. Which is ideal, because connectors waste precious mass on tiny quads like this"
I have the vifly whoopstor 3 charger and I want to charge 450mah lipo batteries with it. Do i charge them with 0.4 C or 0.5 C?,1C. ie 0.45A. 0.5A is fine K. Sorry I meant 0.4 or 0.5 A.(Im new)
probably buy a goggle that won't break?,i broke it. they fell and a sma slot snapped off. now im forced to use one antenna
I assume the sma ripped the pads off with it? or is it resolderable?,you cant save it. i need to get a new board
I don't suppose you can send a pic?. You might be able to solder on a new pigtail or smth,"Yeah it doesn't really matter, theyre so close. the board isnt fixable. i need a new one"
"wait.... the vr008 dont have any type of diversity thing, right?","Hey all, I recently switched over to linear rates and I love the control. However I miss the quick snappy turns. I played around with setting modes in betaflight to swap back and forth between two rate profiles (almost like gears in a car) and it didn’t work :/. Any thoughts on how to hit a middle ground between the two Then yea, you'll be finding another set of goggles, because the VR008 are so cheap and so widely cloned that there's *no* incentive for any manufacturer to sell spare parts"
...what do you think the point of having two antennas is?,"getting better signal. *i think so* This is a good tip will try out later, for now zipties does the job well Ha. No. But yes. If you see a receiver with two antennas, it has diversity reception. That's, sort of, by definition"
"All of the pins are clearly labelled on both, are they not?","other than old one being labeled HV Input, which I assume is my 7V-22V. just making sure lol"
"Except DATA, which seems to be new, maybe instead of smart audio?  Also 2 ground pins on the old one but only one on the new, but that should not matter",Yes Data is Smart Audio. Audio is for an actual mic

Id need to see the other parts, but it looks right",Are these arms on right for a X layout https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1306731262798467113 If anyone has time pls When i take a picture with the camera that converts my hand into jpeg compression When I can't get an answer :loudly_crying_face: You're able to flip the arm and still attach it so you're able to misalign them that's why I wanted to make sure. Its a source one v5 My beloved :PepeLove:
https://youtu.be/XAzNhubDp2o?si=c4nPau7YOKcrWwUh he shows which way you should mount the arms,"my quad doesn't listen. it never goes on fatshark 1. it always defaults to some random frequency my goggles can't do. I've tried Betaflight lua. expresslrs lua I've reset the firmware 5 times. some darwinfpv one. smart audio Might be stupid audio if it doesn't work i need help.; i just put together my first 5 inch 4s drone. radiomaster rp3, jumper tlite v2, speedybeef405, whenever i arm my drone. it goes to 100% throttle instantaneously. but if i have the throttle on my jumper at 100 when i arm it, it does nothing. also if i move the throttle at all it does nothing Sounds like wrong transmitter settings i went through my jumper and redid all my switches. i only set up an arm and a beeper. and they are two position switches Underrated comment. Are you sure your vtx table is right i went through betaflight and it shows in the receiver tab when i move throttle yaw pitch, they are all moving correctly"
What exactly do you mean 100% throttle. Are the props on? Props off? Is it showing this in beta flight?,"shows in beta flight, props off. as soon as it is armed, the motors RATTLE this thing around my desk but when i slide the slider on motors tab, it is smooth Without propellers, the motors have no way of correcting the quads movement and it just flips out. @itsfaptastic thats not terrifying at all lmao Try with props, carefully. If you have a motor direction, fc orientation, motor numbering, or prop direction issue it will also flip out with props on * The PID loop expects to have control * Without props it doesn't have control * Not having control results in an error increase  * Higher error means more effort to spin up the motors * Repeat over and over thousands of times per second"
i went through my motor directions and fc orientation and motor numbering. guess i gotta pray it works. what should i do if i just doesnt throttle up?. ill tackle that when it comes to it. tyvm for the help,"When you arm, it should spin up the motors to a low speed. If it flips out, just come back and we'll keep helping you. If it doesn't throttle up all ill be confused lol. No problem Be prepared to flick disarm at any second if anything goes wrong with props on"
I have an actual question: Who convinced you to do 4s?. lately a lot of people have been going 4s for no reason. and I need to find out why,"I was wondering the same and forgot about that i just saw that my motors required 4s so i built a 4s battery For 5"" 6s is kinda the standard now. Ah, kv ratings need to be lower to run higher voltages. Some motors you can get in different kv options yeah mine are 2755 kv Dayum. What size. That quad is gonna be crazy fast, i bet the batteries will get warm ehhhh it's normal for 4s 5"" Didn't even know they made em in that kv thats all that was in stock for me over here lol"
Have you used the simulator?,"people figured out that to get reasonable performance out of 4s, higher kv was necessary ive got about 100 hrs in sim Youll be fine. Pick an open area and dont fly to far away for a bit Don't forget to disarm before your quad crashes in something/someone yeah im just lookin to hover around Yeah definitely disarm the moment you realize youre gonna crash, might save you a burnt esc 100hrs in the sim is *plenty*. Or a finger. But i don't think theyll have the quad near anyone to begin with lol He's gonna be near himself I don't think i have 100 hours in a sim (I've found out what happens if you stand too close to your quad) I have not because i am not stupid. Jk jk xD I'm also not stupid (at least since after the accident) Haha. One cannot stay stupid for long That sentence sounds super wrong, fuck grammar 100 hours should be fine These kids got it easy. Back in the days of flysky, you couldn't just plug in the radio and sim with usb. :KEKw: I still don't do that, bluetooth:PepeCoolGlasses: Treat your drone with respect, like it’s going to kill you. This is always important, but more so with a new and untested one. Never forget that a 5"" can actually kill you Ukrainians be strapping grenades as if the props are no enough"
When they are just turned on or when the VTX is connected?,can someone please tell me why I'm getting this inside my goggles when the VTX is connected.. I don't think its the goggles because it works fine with other drones. its just the pavoPRO Lots of things can kill you. Sure it can but unless you get hit in the head at some insane speed or get an artery cut its kinda unlikely so you awnsered your own question Not that it wont give you a nasty cut regardless obviously
"i think what you meant to ask is how to fix it. but yeah, prolly a vtx. did you let it overheat or smth?","But honestly i think id be more worried about hitting a car, distracting a driver, and causing a crash Make sure the camera is properly connected and all. You could try swapping out cameras and VTXs to troubleshoot and see which part is broken"
gps can work with only uart right?,"You’d be surprised how much damage a 5” can do and how quickly. I lost the tip of a finger, right through the nail, bone and skin like a knife through butter.  I was leaning over the drone when I armed it and it went crazy cos of a misconfiguration. Super lucky it didn’t hit my face or neck. we did the calculation but basically. a 5 inch at hover. will cut through your finger I did the experiment :slightly_smiling_face: of course it depends on props and so on. but you don't need a high speed to get hurt badly well yeah theyll tear you up but youd have to be pretty unlucky to actually *die* to one. im not advocating against safety or anything. obviously theyll remove a finger without hesitation yes but i have a feeling this question has a bad background story. that makes no sense nah i got few gps come with few more wire and i cant remember did i connected it. just make sure"
If the unit has a magnetometer it will be i2c. The extra wires are SDA and SCL?,"imma stay 2 inch on quad. and ducted. i think yes. but it did not have magnetometer as its manual said... it could have a barometer too Drones are safe if you use them in a safe way. Just like a car. However like a car, you gain a new found respect when you get in a wreck. Gives you a new perspective.. Cars are soft and drones are sharp i dont think one arm switch is enough :Harold: That’s what pre-arm is for :slightly_smiling_face:"
ive never used prearm but its a good idea. stat check?,"idk i learn it from ardupilot, it have a lot hardware checking option You can put pre-arm on a momentary switch in beta flight. Your arm switch will do nothing unless you also press pre-arm you can also program it into your radio and save a channel. betaflight is easier tho"
"I want to build a 75 mm whoop optimized for flight time and guerilla whooping: building dives, etc. I have an air75 which I understand is pretty optimized already. The main sources I see for tinywhoop builds focus on speed at the cost of flight time so I understand that in the tinywhoop community this is an unusual goal. What components should I use and what size battery? I want about 5 mins flight time at 25/100mW","i really think a larger battery and efficient props are all you would need. lower kv motors would help. just gotta find the balance, i dont think it would be that hard Messing with ESC settings could help a teeny bit yeah, timing and frequency Ok. So like 550 mah lava batteries would be good. What would you recommend. And would going with a 65 mm build with the same battery be beneficial or no larger props are going to be more efficient. i havent actually personally ever had a 75mm whoop but rotorbuilds.com might have some good examples. also make it as light as you can. the lava batteries in general are good iirc. im not sure if the 550 are grepow or not Ok thanks for the advice"
Can i fly my Air75 outside in wet conditions such as snow and puddles on the ground? Or do I need to waterproof it?,you'd need to waterproof it. and that makes it heavier. mg chemicals 422c
"if you can solder then no. but almost worth it to buy a better AIO right? <https://betafpv.com/products/air-brushless-flight-controller?variant=41142912745606>. lighter, newer, probably only three times as expensive as a receiver",Is it a pain to install an elrs receiver on a mobula 7 (actually physical install and configuration) Ah. That’s what I was assuming what I ordered but ended up being a PNP. Listing didn’t say it was a PNP ouch. the mobula7 as a whole is a bit old now
honestly maybe?. That's your choice though,"What 75mm would you recommend I recommend you read this, specifically the first paragraph. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250. The Air75 is the newest and probably the most recommended right now. is the lightest BNF with the new gyros, G4 microcontroller and a neat decent camera *or, you can go diy and build a better quad*"
"Is it possible to just take any drone, break open its remote controller, and wire it up to make it programmable? If not, what are some cheap FPV programmable drones?. Not looking for anything very advanced, it just needs a camera and is programmable. I'm using it for a project where I use hand gestures to send commands to a drone (the hand gesture AI would likely be the main part). Programming wise, I'd like to use an actual programming language (so not block-based) and preferable mainstream ones like Java, Python, C++, etc","things I'd look into are INAV or Ardupilot so you can get position hold and your controller code doesn't need to directly control the attitude of the craft, it can just request left/right/up/down/forward/back from INAV.  Then you need a way to have your computer vision thingy see the camera feed, cheap way (but with lots of latency) might be an analog system then an analog to hdmi or something converter on your ground station. Otherwise, walksnail or hdzero probably.  Finally you'd want a way for your controller thingy to speak CRSF to an ELRS module."
"if you can get it to speak CRSF to an elrs module, yes. buy what?","a drone that can do this you'd want one with gps and a barometer, and possibly a optical flow sensor"
"you'll likely have to get the gps separately, the ones that come with gps are big 7"" chonkers that could kill someone.

Im still not able to find online if they are programmable with actual programming languages or not flight controllers are just microcontrollers. ardupilot allows scripting and interfacing in whichever way you could possibly ever want
"ohhhh i see. that was confusing to me in my research, i'm very new. thanks!. are there any good arudpilot tutorials?. and how would I know if a drone is ardupilot-compatible?","no tutorials, just really good documentation. all on their site. available targets are probably listed somewhere on github, but as long as chibios supports the specific MCU you can always add a target for it. just as a guideline. F405, F745, H7** MCU's would be fine. don't know what else by the way, it's probably not worth reinventing something like ardu. it would cost you hundreds if not thousands of hours and a lot of learning. and you'll be able to do anything you want with something like ardupilot, just get what you actually want to do done first yeah. thanks for referring me to that resource!"
Well if there is 0.5 volts of variation in a cell then it doesn’t really matter because that cell is dead anyways right?,not really a cell guy. dunno. said what i know
"> as soon as i set my ARM switch ON my motors throttle all the way up Is it really ""as soon as"" or does it start to happen after you (at least once) raise the throttle above like 20%?","curious. In BF Receiver tab, take a look at what happens to the throttle channel when you click the arm switch when i do that, aux 1 turns on. throttle doesnt spike or anything also > then turn off ONLY WHEN THROTTLE IS AT 0 the motors shouldn't turn off when armed... @itsfaptastic the throttles dont do anything when i arm them at anything over 1% throttle setting. but if my throttle lever is bottomed out, holding it down. and i arm it. it roars to life. but if i put throttle at mid range, and arm it. it does nothing at all. any throttle input after that does nothing Can you show screenshots of:  Configuration tab (top part is good enough) Modes tab (with Hide unused enabled) Receiver tab (with the radio on, throttle normally at the bottom and arm switch clicked)   Make sure that at least one of these screenshots includes the entire BF Configurator window. Also Motors tab heres three, i just pulled one of the pins outta my battery so i gotta redo that rq before i can sdhow motors tab. and receiver tab hm, nothing problematic so far"
Why bother making a thread if you're just going to litigate in another channel?. Honestly,"because i just joined this server and didnt know about the thread thing, so i made one later on. thhis is where i first started"
"When you arm, which direction are the props pushing the air?","down. when i arm, i am holding the drone at the bottom, and it wants to take off"
"ok, im just trying to figure out what im doin wrong. preset?. like from betaflight?. no i did not","I wouldn't think the quad should arm at all if the throttle above 0%. I could be wrong that would make sense, so it just doesnt rocket off with as soon as you arm it. but then at 0, it does exactly that"
Can you show your pid tab?. It means there are 9 slots in a stator and 12 poles/magnets,"is there anything out of the ordinary because i have no idea what im looking at. also when its armed, it doesnt beep at all the beeper doesnt sound. also heres the other 2 pages of pid tuning Show the sensors tab in Betaflight, set gyro scale to 2"
where is the sensors tab?,Check expert mode at the top. Then it will show up on the left
Does the throttle channel move smoothly here if you raise and lower the throttle?,it was 2000. yes it moves smoothly
Does the quad move properly in the setup tab?. This sounds like normal behavior so far without props on. Unless I'm not understanding what the issue is,"yes it moves correctly. the problem is, the second i hit arm even with props on. it shoots up to full throttle until the runaway kicks it off. and when i move throttle, it does nothing"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0wFSTdpIWM. Follow this,"Sounds like you have something wrong with your configuration i think i may have figured it out. this esc stack doesnt support dshot. at least from what google says. it says to use multishot or oneshot. i am so stupid it'd have to be truly ancient to not do DShot. that can definitely do DShot oh google says dshot not supported What in the fucking. No omg it's this again. it runs DShot. SpeedyBee just kinda fucked it up. DShot 300 should be fine yeah it just kept doing it again. as soon as i armed it, it ran away"
How worried should I be about voltage sag? Sometimes when I hit 100% throttle voltage drops to 19v (3.1v per cell). How does it affect the battery? What if I go below 3v per cell (at sag)?,"[WeebleedFPV has the target posted on their product page](https://webleedfpv.com/products/mobula6-2024-v2-w-motor-plugs) for the Mob 6 2024 which uses that FC. Any drop below 3.2 is less than ideal. Sustained drops below 3.0 can cause immediate measurable damage to the pack Why does no one buy the v4 at least if i arm the thing with the throttles at 50% nothing happens. no arming, no throttle jump. Ok so, when the motors don't spin, that means it isn't armed at all. So that's good.. If runaway prevention is disarming your quad for you that means something about the motors or FC orientation is not correct. dadealus i went with the CRAZYBEEF4SX1280 since that was listed in the dump file i created Ok. That target makes sense given Happymodel's history, but I just couldn't find it confirmed anywhere"
"Guys do you think i can use this to charge my LiPo batteries from my d6 pro?. (Cigarette lighter to xt60, capable with 12v in a car, 24v in a truck)","Because people think YouTubers are their friends.. Yeah that will power your charger. Careful though, the fuse in your car for the lighter sockets might not handle the current draw. Ive also watched the videos and planned to buy it, I saw there was a newer version, googled if it was better, and bought the v4"
So how can i know if the socket will handle the current draw?,"Your critical thinking skills are more developed than a lot of people, apparently. :KEKw:. Find the fuse in your car for the lighter circuit, see what it is and make a note.  Work out the current draw of the charger at the current you plan on using to charge your packs.  Compare. Check on your car make/model. Usually in modern cars there is a fuse protecting the wiring. 10A is probably what the fuse is.  You can check in your cars owner manual or under the hood in the fuse bay."
"the majority will just take the scam youtuber with only affiliate links their word, as they would never hurt them or lie on purpose. the drone flies and they're saying it does great right!?","That's a 4.75A output from the charger, assuming a 100% efficient conversion, which it won't be. The rule of thumb that I saw progressive RC reccomend back in the day was to assume/plan on ~80% efficiency. I doubt you'll be charging your LiPos at 4.5A, but if it's a quad channel charger.... That's a good rule of thumb for most power supplies IME. But if you're plugging into a car, you're doing DC-DC, not AC-DC Even a dual channel, that caps you to 2.25A to give you efficiency margin.. Probably less.. So, yeah, it'll work, but don't go charging 4 LiPos at once at 2A a piece.. Or it'll stop working. What if you connect a charger directly to the car battery. That should be powerful enough. And the right voltage"

(Zero Order Vs First Order controls). So they got all sorts of assists and virtual joystick shite that makes using 'proper' control setup impossibly uncompetitive.

well you should check if it's plugged in at all still. and loses signal as in video or also control link?,Umm so I just crashed my Air75 tinywhoop and now after even minor crashes it loses signal and I have to replug the battery have you. considered stopping plugging things in. and diagnosing the issue before you do any more damage. by powering it : P.

But i was on my last lipo so i repluged it like 2 times a big issue with the air75 is the antenna connector ripping off. you need to brace it with fishing line or a zip tie. so that'll be the first thing you should check Umm how should it look if its ripped off...

I love when a fly comes out of my wallet :smiling_face_with_tear:. Meaning it lasts longer https://tenor.com/view/wallet-penacony-honkai-star-rail-clockie-no-money-gif-14673244072619990643 Also, the goggles will shut off before you full drain a 2S pack, because they can't handle less than 7V. That won't happen with a 3S or 4S lipo Exactly. Ok cool so the one he/she recommended is what i shall buy. Hota t6 will charge that right How do you power the hota. Does it plig into wall No, the t6 needs a power supply If you have a high power smartphone usb-c charger, that can work Ok ill try and remember in the morning well it is morning its just gone midnight so i will carry this conversation in the morning working out psu. As i am tired af. https://tenor.com/view/open-eyes-tom-sleepy-gif-14594139. Thks again"
"Which is the best size drone to make as of ease of building, parts availability and price to performance?","any of them. tinywhoop, 3.5"", 5"", 7"" what exactly is a tiniwhoop small drones. typically with a 65mm or 75mm wheelbase and prop guards emilia, i managed to get that board back to life and reflashed and running.. Thanks for your help."
is a meteor 75pro any good?,yes. but worse for indoor flights than the normal meteor75. and worse in every way than the air75
"ok thanks. the only store in my country with the air75 has next to no goggles, should i just order them separately?",Sure. Just costs more shipping
anyone know the defaults for this? 4.5.0,can't you go to like. a different preset. and just look you would think. and yet i dont know the most efficient way to do that. i was considering a diff all and then resetting the whole board. actually im gonna do that
they are close to $400 aud. do u think u could suggest a more budget friendly pair?,they are a bit expensive and not in my budget range
What abt there batteries?,"it got recommended to me by somebody else itll work but the whoopstor is better it's actually known for not charging properly. pretty sure it also only charges at some absurd speed so basically battery toast are the betafpv engineers brain dead. 1a/port *dependent on input power*. .4a/port if you give it 5v 2a and use every port. they had the sense to give it a lihv switch but wtf Ok, so some betafpv gear can be questionable at times they have a lot of great stuff and they have a lot of awful stuff https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250/1159102552713994250"
does this look too back heavy? or is it ok,"This guy didn't read the beginner's guide I probably didn’t read it as in depth as I could’ve but I’m just trying to understand what sort of options I have itll fly but yeah. scoot the battery as far forward as you can there. the strap being off center isnt the end of the world bro. yes. only because i have the same one. i put mine here, i used the other battery pad it comes with too, just cut the black one Why did you have a candy corn keyboard Because it looks cool Fair. I usually forget there's a lot of kids here hey now. candy corn is good only makes my teeth hurt a little bit I mean, my keyboard is just plain old white&black, but orange lights also look cool just cycles colors slowly"
damn how are you routing the battery lead to the top? i tried doing it from the back but it took too much space. i also wanted to make it come out the side but i was worried of getting it chopped by the props,"I have a keyboard with no lights because I am boring I have rgb, and opaque keycaps, I have both worlds I might be borrowing keyboards from the office just out the right side left. here this is brighter and without the bat strap. it wraps the balance plug up nicely too"
So recently I had a hard landing and now my battery doesn't fix in place and just unplugs mid flight or after a crash. How can I fix this? The battery doesn't seem particulary diffrent from others,I am back to talk abt a psu. For the hota t6 wrap some tape around it to thicken it What is a good battery case. Like the fireproof ones. I am going to have some 1s batteries and rhe 4s i was recommended for my goggles An ammo box. With the side rubber seals removed so it doesn't become a bomb if they do explode Idk where im going to find an ammo box and i would rather not
Uk. Yih can just buy ammo boxes?!. Idk why i find that absurd. But id rather have the bag,the bags don't do anything really they're supposed to be but they aren't really. which is why we use ammo boxes and BatSafes
double-walled metal box with insulation and an exhaust filter. anda  grommet so you can run your charging cable inside. https://youtu.be/pzlXcv5ONSY?si=-C-G7DAkCc1D4M5C. https://youtu.be/tavpXgmL16M?si=PxhQhbqyQ4nuiDo3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv_3vwSZmzA,Its even themes. Themed*. bat safe it is
Just finished building a 3inch toothpick and planned to use this preset with it.  Question is...How can I find out about my ESC settings? Also if the ESC's come with Bluejay and DShot enabled am I save to assume RPM filtering is supported?,"You can check it in ESC config. If its a bluejay than RPM filtering is supported Depending on the output power setting of the Tx, it can damage the power amp in the Tx.. The radio transmitter emits electromagnetic waves from the antenna. Radio is the same as visible light, but lower frequency. Important bit is that it is a form of energy.  Now, the radio transmitter has an amplifier as the last stage before the antenna. It boosts the output to whatever you set it too, 100mW for example.  If the transmitter is missing the antenna, the energy the amplifier is outputting has nowhere to go, so it gets converted to heat instead of electromagnetic energy. That heat builds up until the amplifier melts, and the transmitter dies.  More expensive gear has special circuitry to capture that energy before it gets converted to heat and dumps it into something that can handle it, to prevent damage.. To add to this, if the output power is low enough, the heatsink on the PA will keep it safe."
I've never worked with the ESC Configurator before I must admit. You know where I can find the PWM setting exactly?,"It's set when you flash the ESCs with Bluejay, IIRC.. It's usually written on the right, above each each where the current flashed version data is.  Yours is in German though, so I'm not sure if that changes anything."
So next to Bluejay 0.19 in this case? Interesting...,"Yeah, usually.. How odd."
Aren’t those modes supposed to be yellowed when the switches are triggered in their area ???,I mean the “Angle” and “Beeper” tabs … :thinking_face:
"You'd get atrocious range with an antenna on, as a rule.. At 8°C, you'd probably be ok at a low power. What do you have it set to?","You're fine. Don't make a habit of it though :winking_face: :yellow_heart:. If you regularly take the antenna off (for storage in a box or whatever) get a 50 Ohm terminator to screw on in place of the antenna.. It'll act as a ""blanking plug"" and protect the radio if you power it up without an antenna. i will prob. put it in the box it comes with. there i dont have to take of the antenna I have to take mine off to put it in the Peli case I have, and I sim a lot too, so don't want the antenna on all the time.. My sim ""model"" on the radio turns off both internal and external radio modules, but having a terminator on has saved my Tx more than once. :KEKw:"
Honestly I think I'll just try to update Bluejay and select a PWM frequency there. Is there anything which can go wrong with updating?,Not really. They're pretty bulletproof.
Gotcha. Any suggestions about which frequency to use? 48 is the sweet-spot from what I heard.,"Depends what drone they're on, but 48 will work pretty much universally."
hi guys can someone tell me how i can tune out propwash with blackbox logs?,"The primary factor in improving prop wash handling is actually going to be improving how you fly. But yea there are some tuning things you can do too to help it ...thats why im here asking how to do it Crank the D-gain, make sure you have good filtering How do you take lenses out of goggles Heyyy. I just entered Depends on the goggles. Hi"
Cool. I can make a camouflage fpv drone for up to $600?,"Why Camo. Well you have to take the screws out. Then it should be pretty easy Dji mini 2 :red_heart: Bruh that's nothing compared to what my 5"" did to me"
? :))) how bad was it for you?,"Search for a tutorial how to disassemble the 030 Do they not slide out. Nice one Sorry for not marking it as a spoiler, idk how to do it on mobile Bro it's only 5"":loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: You have to take the 2 halves apart and then you can take it out I don't think I want fpv anymore :)) Nope its just that one Huh. Maybe on yours, I have the 04x pro I have the 039. Just found out you dont even need to take the screw off. Can the bat safe be used for storage aswell I did the math on this a while ago. In the *absolute* worst-case, a 5” prop is capable of *severely* damaging fingers, if not severing them"
The math?. Did yoi sacrifice someone?,https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/886098469016723456/1301201675721248830 The math was literally done while I got hurt
Werent kidding wow. ?,Yea you can store batteries in there Also can i have a 4s in the mini. Might need some maths for that i’m sure it depends on the size of the battery I think it was a 4s 2300 i cant remember. I need to find it. https://www.hobbyrc.co.uk/gnb-2300mah-4s-50c-lipo-battery. This one Yea it looks like you could fit two or three of them in there
Oh cool. That is a good battery for the sky030 right?,Cool thks. Hota t6. For charger
Cool. How do i power the hota t6. So i need a power supply. Would a laptop chrager work?,a USB PD power brick. or any other DC power supply
PD?. Oh bo. Idk what that is. Oh wait. Not a pd,get a photo of the side where a lot of the text is
what mass and acceleration did you assume to arrive at a force equal to the bite force of a crocodile or white shark?,"The mass of a single 5” prop blade spinning at 35000 RPM stopping in 1cm, iirc It's not PD and they've asked this before I meant the thing that plugs into the wall Oh. Uh lemme find one. What will it say if it is pd"
does it have a USB C connector at the end?. you're looking for something like this. a USB PD power brick,"under that assumption there must be something off i think: a prop weights ~4g. so lets say a single blade is 1g. tip speed of 6cm radius at 35,000 RPM is ~120m/s. deaccelerating that over 10mm results in 720N. equal to the force of a human bite. IMO the distance would be smaller and we also have the rotational mass of the motor bell. but it's still far away from the 16kN that you arrived at I can re-evaluate later, I welcome the math check It felt a bit worse than a bite please do. it's interesting to put it in relation to other things @Vitroid it does have a usb c end try to see if it works with the charger then. 45W is enough for single LiPo charging Ok. I need to get the charger and stuff first so more waiting :loudly_crying_face:. It can only charge one lipo at a time cant it yes. without any adapters that is Yes. If i find a higher wattage psu what is the limit Like what wattage is too much for the charger it can pull 90W max via USB PD Ok. So if i find a higher wattage i should ise that one. If its below 90W it can be a 200W one. the charger will just only draw 90W Oh ok. Also do goggles requirean sd card. Or whatever the memory thing is they can work without it. but it's best to have one to always record DVR Ok good. Is dvr just a video of it. So if i wanted to post content to yt i would need one yes. DVR records the video you see in the goggle There pretty cheap so that ok id say so. not only is it needed for DVR how vitroid said but if you ever need to upgrade the firmware on the goggles you need a sd card for that Right so qiick list Gnb 2300mAh 4s battery Hota t6 And bat safe mini depends on the model of goggles though and if upgrading firmware will ever be needed Its very complicated on the sky030"
what does the white thing do ??,Anyone knows realy good to use betaflight and seting up drone with add me and if you could we vc so yall help me That port is for the voltage sensing wire. Connect that port to some voltage and the “RXBT” telemetry sensor will show the voltage. The obvious use is to connect it to the positive lead of your main battery oh so like when my plane is up in the air it shows how much abttery is left. like in volts i get it so just pair receiver and do to tele the u just find it
nvm im kinda high. so how do i plug the thing. no ground wire needed??. it comes with only red wire,"The ground connection is the ground rail of the receiver, which is connected to the ground of your voltage regulator, which is connected to the ground of the battery"
can u please make it more simpler?,okayy. i just had to read it like 5 times then process it Do you know how the pins on a pwm receiver are connected together okay to the ground rail is connected to the bat internally Do you know how a voltage regulator or BEC works. Yes
How do I generally know which one the Smartaudio pad is?,Look up what a UART is in this context
"Ah really cool, just learned how sequential machines work in uni lol. So T1 and T6 is the Tx port and R1 R6 is Rx port, and I need to connect 1:1. But does it matter if I connect my VTX to the T1 and receiever to R6 for example? Is all of this tuned in software? have not looked at that step at all yet","Correct. The ports tab in Betaflight configurator when connected to the FC allows you set what's connected where :thumbs_up: great thanks! so close now hahah These bits of tinned wire hanging out of the solder beads are suboptimal. Get some iso oh god. Actually I can’t talk Trim the leads shorter so there's no conductor hanging out of the bead.   Leaving them as is, is inviting disaster on your first crash. If that wire shifts and shorts those out... Nothing good."
"yeah I see your point, the only part exposed out of the cable should be in the solder you're saying?","Exactly so. :thumbs_up: I realized this when I started doing my VTX soldering, it got 10x easier to solder as well when only a small bit was exposed lol Cotton buds and isopropanol to clean the flux residue off afterwards too. It's not conductive itself, but it is sticky, and random shit that'll stick to it *can* be conductive. Besides it's corrosive by it's nature, you don't want that shit sitting around on the PCB :yellow_heart:"
"Great tips, really tough to figure this out when nobody you know has any experience, What is the PCB?","Just dipping the buds in a little jar of iso works for me.  (Printed Circuit Board). Yeah learning without help can be rough, you tend to break a lot in the learning process. Nice we can help avoid that here :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: Look at the speedybee pinout, they have one where they show how they recommend where to solder which part Anyone help me setup betaflight and eavrything"
"thanks will do. for sure, but it feels like I could build one in a day now, seemed impossible when I started but not so complicated now.. My VTX is marked 7v-26v, compared to the earlier versions that just said ""High V"", but should according to a wire diagram I should connect it to 5V? Or have I misunderstood the HI voltage and should be using 5V out?","Use the 9v pad to feed the positive power input of the VTx alright that makes more sense. 5V out must for camera or something yeah I mean the 5V out on the VTX Oh, that, yeah, Cam, like you said :thumbs_up: well. you wouldn't want to use that. you'd want to just use the cam and 5v pad on the FC"
"hmm but the 3D print does not fit the poles. Its specifically for tbs source v5 thought, could it be printing error?. Obviously should have checked this before soldering but, how is this supposed to be mounted? The antenna is on the same side as the pins and the button for the VTX is on the opposite end? How am I supposed to mount this any other way than this while having access to the button?","uhhh no, usually it's a much softer coax cable. I don't think that antenna will work well like that and it definitely wont fit my 3d holder for it lmao either get an MMCX-SMA adapter and an SMA antenna, or an MMCX antenna with a softer coax"
now... does it clear the top plate?,"FC, not ESC, but yeah. yeah of course lol thanks. Option 3: yess, at least when I tried it on without the screws, the antenna passes right past it"
are the lava series 1s batteries any good? or are there better brands,"What effect does a bigger stator have when kv is constant. Eg 1404 vs 1504 at constant kv. Question in terms of thrust, power consumed and overall feeling. more torque. meaning that the motor can spin up faster, spin a heavier prop better than a smaller motor, but it will also draw more current I would say they're pretty good. However I fly Tattu 1S batteries, love them https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1159102552713994250. same battery"
pavo  20 pro any good? for a small freestyle drone with ducts (with 03),"It's more like a cinewhoop, not a freestyle quad, but for very light freestyle it'll work, I'm not sure if it has problems with yaw washout as some other cinewhoops do, never owned one. How much more would it affect the flight feel. Say I fly 1404 3800kv with a full size gopro but I swap it for 1504 at same kv. Read the thread I linked them :p. all the folded cells are made by one manufacturer. grepow. which owns Tattu"
"Oh okay, so they repackage the batteries for other brands? Interesting","yup. and then in turn DOGCOM often rebrands again for more brands. like airjacker. shenanigans Didn't know that, cool flying inside a parking lot. indoor one"
yeah... so why ducts?,bec its flying next to people too. 5 people fly at once inside the parking lot. its an indoor one
why not just get a tinywhoop then?,already got one. wanted a hd one. mobula 8 hd seems trash
"do you already have DJI goggles?. because if you can still go Walksnail or HDZero, that'd save you here",ive already got a 5 inch drone with 03. and goggles 2. heard dji bringing out a light 04 unit. thinking of waiting for it
<https://oddityrc.com/products/xi20-pro-hd-o3-version-4s?variant=42794170908822>,I'm also waiting for it lol what would y’all consider a good 1s battery charger for a cheap price vifly whoopstor is like the only choice right now sadly Vifly Whoopstor V3 would be my pick for tinywhoop batteries i hate having one choice lol
Were there ever any other competing 1S chargers?,"in the distant past. but nothing quite like the whoopstor alright that’s an easy choice then the only ""competition"" is the betafpv charger, and that thing is a fire hazard. it charges all batteries at stupid speeds. no settings I've seen Fatshark sell what looks to be a rebranded whoopstor v3 on Rotor riot lol <https://rotorriot.com/products/fat-shark-6-port-1s-lipo-lihv-charger-for-bt2-0-ph2-0> found that strange yeah i mean. that's all what rotorriot, tbs and fat shark are about at this point. they have nothing left but people who recognize the brand Had those break into pieces a couple of times are there any PD power banks that i can use for my goggles or should i stick with a lipo Never buying BetaFPV chargers again ehhhh TBS does their own stuff - whether they do it well or not, up to own interpretation TBS does nothing that hasn't been done, and they do it worse. so it really is all what they have. they're behind on everything oh right i went with the boxer crush I would use lipo, more reliable than USB PD which has its quirks I like the idea of the quad-to-wing FC adapter board well damn the charger is sold out everywhere But you can consider Anker powerbanks, they have great stuff, and Ugreen as well"
"and let's be real... what can Rotorriot do? They're a brand, not an actual manufacturer","yeah, but i just found it being sold on roter riot you don't want to buy from them anyways. <https://pyrodrone.com/products/vifly-whoopstor-3-1s-lipo-lihv-6-channel-dc-usb-c-battery-charger-discharger-for-bt2-0-ph2> https://pyrodrone.com/products/vifly-whoopstor-3-1s-lipo-lihv-6-channel-dc-usb-c-battery-charger-discharger-for-bt2-0-ph2. FUCK OFF. out of my head yeah rotor riot is controversial with their business decisions recently... well. at this point they actively fund war and stuff it's like a company with the sole purpose of ruining itself somehow ik they're doing shitty stuff, but when it comes to selling FPV equipment, they don't have much of a choice apart from getting it made somewhere else Yeah but technically so are almost all FPV companies, not actively tho no not really. most have restrictions in place that actively try to prevent their stuff being sent to war zones Fatshark is actively advertising their stuff carrying bombs in presentations and shit rotorriot got some sort of special patent made that allows their boards to be sold to the US government iFlight does, idk any others. And they still make cheap macro stuff anyway i dont know that i would call it funding war I've seen photos of hundreds iflight chimera quads get into russian hands, they get out of stock immediately after release... but they are clearly ok with participating Yeah it just depends on what you're comfortable with there's a few vtx companies that have restrictions quite frankly im gonna buy whatever i want from where ever i get it cheapest let's be real, most FPV manufacturers either directly or undirectly make stuff that's desireable for war use. RR just skipped the whole ""Plausible deniability"" thing and advertised it straight up they did a lot more than that I'm not buying stuff from rotor riot anyway because the 2 times I did (that was like 1.5 years ago) the import tax to get it into Europe was like half of the drone's price :face_with_tears_of_joy: they spawned other companies literally for it Well, yeah, they're being upfront about it. But now we're talking about Unusual Machines, not Rotor Riot itself no there's a lot more than that lol UM showed RR quads with bombs strapped to them. it's not that deep and RR only went and revealed after people started figuring out they were actively participating We all know that FPV drones can, and are being used for war, either it's a rotor riot quad or aliexpress cheap long range quad we don't all know that you can just buy these awful machines. this is more so about public view than anything Yeah, I don't like people being exposed to the ""bad side"" of FPV there's a large majority that will think you're some magical genius wizard for putting together an FPV quad Ian (MadsTech) had a good video on it somewhere But there isn't much we can do considering what is going in the world rn. Oh yea I also remember that we can watch RR slowly fall apart. for consumers it sucks to see all manufacturers I'd consider really good make drones that are likely aimed at the one-way market. But most people outside of the hobby or people who just fly for fun can see them just as any other FPV drone - RR drones being directly advertised for such use goes much further beyond that RR was and is very influential and it sucks. especially with the FPV ""celebrities"" participating"
In a bad or good way?,"lots of people feel betrayed lol. i mean it was good at first initially positive, but it went to shit It changed, clearly. When was the last time we saw LeDrib in a RR video, months ago if not more! it was funny when they were sponsored by DJI and Redcat at the same time, you could see who paid for the most recent video by which goggles they all had drew candem is at a high position in unusual machines and others"
Do you  think the RR situation has anything to do with Bubby's mom taking leadership of the company? I found that a strange move lol,"they had someone fill in the spot while drew went to UM IIRC Well, RR went from just some fun guys doing what they loved to a business, that now is supporting not the best use of FPV drones, let's put it that way hey goggles X owners. i got a fat strap 2in. says it works with goggles X. i wont fit. ok i tried sticking it in from the front. it worked. but its upside down. and now i cant get it out. fuck it. its staying there"
is there a way to have ELRS and DJI FPV controller connected (as in the extra wire for the dji controller) to the O3 and then switch between them in betaflight configurator? in both cases flying with DJI goggles V2 using the 03?  basicly two pilots used to different controllers so switching to ELRS reciever without modifying the drone,not without a bunch of extra effort. just get the stubborn buddy over to ELRS already :Kek: 1 week till event so im not sure he will want to switch to a different controller now even  tho i could lend him the big TX16 as i think its easier to fly with that than the DJI controller even when you never tried it before :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Why not get something in the form factor of the DJI controller like the Radiomaster Zorro?,that doesnt have full sized sticks
"sorry, completely forgot... you flew a full size GoPro on 1404's?","Ok but DJI controllers don't either. You either go for compact size or full gimbals yeah, i dont think buddy minds the size its just that we have one drone ready for the event, and would like to maybe switch who is flying from time to time but each of us is used to a different controller. if we could switch which controller is active that would be best but seems thats not viable"
couldnt you just set the same bindphrase on both radios and just power on the one youre using?. assuming youre using ELRS,"he uses teh DJI controller, I use ELRS That's how Vardy handed off his 100km elrs run. Power off one, power on the next only solution i can think of is practicing with whatever radio you decide to/have to use since those are 2 completely different protcols yeah I use the boxer and have a reserve tx16s so Im gonna lend him that to try. Just dont know if hes gonna have enough time in a week to practice Yes it was terrible hence I want to get new motors."
what quad is this again?,Custom frame. Was freestyle but doesn't really freestyle much anymore :confused_face:
"huh, the Loan Model feature was removed in 3.4? are you supposed to manually bind the quads now?","that will likely suck with a GoPro no matter what motors you put on it What size would start to make sense. 3.5 or 4. Can change the design and get a new one cut 3.5"" with beefy motors The one I have now flys but it eats through my pack too quick How beefy. Wow. What's flight time like with that size. Also isn't that a bit overkill coming from 1404 you'd practically be building a cinewhoop with no guards"
Would the O3 be better at that size?,most likely. or other lighter cameras I think I'm running into some issue with my O3 it's either faulty or I've got way too much noise becuase the image looks way too blurry. It's dampened properly but issue still their hence why I tried to run full gopro
Hey guys quick question  has anyone here built a drone that can be controlled via a Linux/Windows device?  Im currently building a drone that can be controlled via Steam Deck and was wondering if anyone has managed to do something similar. I'm stuck on how i'd be able to communicate with a transmitter and control a drone using it.   Using walksnail for Video,"https://github.com/kaack/elrs-joystick-control. first image on the repo lol unrelated but keep me updated on this, i also use walksnail and have a steam deck and would LOVE to use it like a DJI smart controller or something"
You mean the thumb? I have seen them however I think the sensor size is still too small for my preferred shooting. Here in the UK the weather is usually gloomy so the ISO tends to shoot too high creating too much noise. I need the biggest sensor I can get. Hence full gopro.,"Also unrelated @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) I messaged you a few mo tha ago about buying into ws and you said DJI would never make a lighter vtx to compete with ws becuase they don't need to compete. Now I know these are just leaks but the supposed dji o4 lite is said to be just 10g. Do you still think dji wouldn't buy into the micro category. it's pretty much confirmed thank you, will look in to this. will do!"
"In that case, I have the goggles v2 and o3. Do you think it's worth getting the goggles 3 with the new o4, or is it still worth buying into WS? I just want the best penetration and range.",decide when it comes out
have you used this before?,"no, but I've seen it be developed 10g is still too heavy for 75mm yeah ive seen people say that walksnail struggles on a 75mm and it's like 5-6 grams walksnail is 4g lighter and hdzero is MUCH lighter"
but the fact it has 4k DVR on a tinywhoop?. fucking insane,"running ardupilot (or inav on the next version) would give you mavlink capability. then you can run stuff like QGroundcontrol on the phone/desktop. maby have a hdmi capture card for the video overlay hdzero is not worth it for me. i understand ws is lighter but i dont fly that small.. what about 2s 2"" yeah even a 85mm can take it i want to avoid using ardpilot since i dont want it on the drone for now @Vitroid this is what my O3 footage looks like. Thats 4k 60fps. Its definitely not supposed to look like that so no clue whats up.. is that faulty, noise or something else. Ive used this vtx on 5 different builds and they all look the same no clue, I don't have O3"
"my friend is getting into RC with an RC crawler and wants a new battery and charger with a budget of $180AUD ($116USD).

"Alrighty. Cause I really wanna get my antenna mount on, but this electrical tape I have is being annoying. It’s also an aluminum case, so maybe it’s not conducting with the actual vtx?","@pk yeah, the first beeps are initialization and the second set is connection to the fc. check your wiring and connectors on the fc/esc cable. carbon fiber can be conductive. this is an issue if you have two components touching your frame. technically its safest for nothing to touch the frame, but if the vtx is the only thing touching the frame then theres no reason it would hurt well i think its painted anyway. but a lot of times stuff like that is either grounded or not connected. if its built properly, its fine. t motor *probably* knows what theyre doing. but i dont like to trust it I’m gonna try to re electrical tape it tmr. And if it touches, oh well it should be fine yeah. havent heard of people having that sort of issue in years We’ve prolly just gotten smarter tbf that or manufacturers stopped making fcs and escs have conductive mounting holes and metal hardware Mine is entirely covered in an aluminum shell"
"basically all analog vtx's will work with anything, theyre pretty standard. the vtx gets power, a video signal, and usually a wire called smart audio. everything now days has that. is that a quality vtx? probably not, but itll work","ahh i see, thank you!"
"Does this order matter?. Aetr, and mode 4 is the ""standard"" right ?","r there any cracked/free versions of DRL simulator that is your mapping of inputs to channels. what you have there is CH1 Rudder, Ch2 Elevator, Ch3 Throttle Ch4 Aileron, so RETA. the ""default channel order"" is the default order for *new* models, but obviously won't overwrite existing models because that would mess up all your mixes."
so the mixes mapping doesnt really matter if its set to aetr?. or should i delete all 4 of them and make them go aetr instead of reta?,"the mixes are what decides what channel does what. so yeah make it aetr, or whatever you have set in betaflight bf is set to aetr. my question is not that :p then make your radio send in AETR order"
"and channel order is aetr, Does the Mixes  Order matter?","the mixes order *is* your channel order so i need to change the mixes order to match default channel order no. the channel order you set here doesn't actually change anything. all it does is when you make a NEW model, that's the order the pre-populated mixes will be in. you can of course change that"
Do you have a controller yet?,"Only if you want to get into the hobby and don't have a drone yet. If you want to have a sim that doesn't get boring after some time, I'd go for a sim that costs money"
Will sand in radiomaster cnc gimbal damage it ? Or i can still fly until I’ll get rid of it ?,"Ok hear me out, just clean it"
Is there a solid reason for buying DJI gear?,"I have a very fair amount of DJI points Even so, I cannot in any good conscience allow you to agree to take the eWaste that is the DJI controller off their hands, paid for or not."
Why so? Whats wrong with that controller?,You need a proper radio. That abomination is utter shite. It has zero redeeming features whatsoever.
"Oh, in that case, what controller would you recommend?","Rediomaster Boxer, hands down."
What other equipment would i need?,"Even the base variant is leagues ahead of dji's best effort. ELRS receiver (the other ""end"" of the control link) I think that comes with the base I want to buy Wait. No., yeah, that.. It does.. The ELRS, means it has the correct Rx in it already. Yeah, that would work well with a Boxer.. If you go for the Boxer, get the Radiomaster 5000mAh Li-Ion battery for it too. The radio will charge it from USB-C, or you can use the charger you'll need for the drone's LiPos."
"Ok, so besides that, I need some spare props (just incase), and a charger. Right?","I have a TX16 (the boxer's OTT cousin), spends more time plugged into my PC than connected to any of my drones :KEKw: Props, yeah, plenty of those (couple of packs). and yeah a charger"
Anything else you can think of?,"Drone (with o3, ELRS), LiPos, charger, Radio (ELRS version, and battery pack), goggles (and battery for goggles), spare props, copy of Velocidrone. Already have the last one! Thank you so much. Noice. It's getting an update soon too"
Fr? Like new 2025 maps?,"Not sure entirely, I only have rumors. I know for sure an update is coming, and the simulation itself has been improved. That's all I know for sure.. And anything I'm not sure of, I won't comment on. Knowing that they're improving the simulation core is even more of a reason for people to ditch other games in favour of Velocidrone IMO.. That is, after all, it's very reason for being."
Hi is it normal that radiomaster throttle gimbal making a sound when its getting move ?,"depends on the sound, but probably not Wait ima record you sound. Its making this sound but its rlly quiet , you need to move ear to the gimbal to hear it"
"that's normal, it's just the plastic parts rubbing against each others, if you have time to spare, you can use keyboard lube and lube the gimbals, it will also make them smoother, a thicker lube would be better imo, but it's not necessary personnally I used this on my boxer, works great https://keygem.com/products/keygem-switch-lubricant?_pos=12&_sid=15c8cb02f&_ss=r","I ordered radiomaster lube. Also those are CNC gimbals well, then it's the metal parts that are rubbing against together, still the same"
you could make a flying wing and it'd fly for much longer than a quadcopter. eCalc is good. about the best you can get. what are you trying to figure out?,"when adding a larger battery let's say from 200 to 400g the actual weight goes up by a lot more so I'm new to drones, I'm a software engineer and want to build a prototype for some idea I have  I thought quad would be easier to start with given the amount of information out there.  Goal is to use my steam deck to control the drone along with viewing the data.   wanted to make a fixed wing in the future but in the shape and design of a switch blade drone because idk why I just love the design of a switch blade drone https://tenor.com/view/samuel-johnson-reading-what-gif-14649049. if you add 200g you add 200g there is no extra weight that materializes out of nowhere Exactly. that's why i don't trust the calculations that doesn't make any sense xD Try it for yourself. ignore the rest of the specs, just wanted to run the calc"
Will it count the battery twice when set to incl. Drive?,"I don't see how that question makes any sense xD And Nope still same behaviour And from what I can see in the screenshots its correct anyway so you've chosen latency and shitty joysticks you went from a 27g to a 300g battery.... from 3*9g to 3\*100g I'm trying to understand why when adding 90g,  it adds 300 because the battery has 3 cells"
It counts the weight per cell?,"not an issue for me, if I had wanted latency I'd have gone with a better system  I'm not going to be building anything that requires fast maneuvering As far as I can see.. and I'm using this tool for the first time in my life xD The joysticks will be an issue, but I don't really see the point of this in the first place it was pretty apparent when changing the battery configuration didn't change the weight that's so cursed... but thank you why does it have to have a point, it's just a fun project oh, you're the guy who asked about this in UAVF @Bart I mean... I don't know what you find fun or anything but I wouldn't really be interested in solving solved problems and spending hundreds of hours doing so so, you're not the kind of person who would buy an Ender, you're the kind of person who would buy a Bambu I gotta keep my balance though. get the Prusa"
"I have time, I have the financial means  I just want to build something cool, what's the point of playing video games? same logic, or what's the point in watching movies? same logic both have zero realistic benefits and just loss of time and money","no that's not really what I'm saying yeah but just one thing... gamepad sticks are REALLY not suited to controlling FPV stuff >.>. mayyybe if you do poshold+althold long projects need a lot of motivation as well I know, but still. It's just for fun at the end of the day not trying to create anything with practical use ATM. plus the end goal is to have the drone be autonomous in what I want it to do Steam Deck is a chonker for that. and all you'll be doing is yeeting out CRSF to some ELRS module and calling it a day"
so you're planning to write your own FC software? because you mentioned that you don't want ardupilot on it,"But I gotta admit that I want to see an ELRS module on the back of a Steam Deck. wait. don't write your own FC software. that never ends well. on the first to 100th try at least. *lots of broken stuff* there's better ways to go around it than trying it in real life lol. but you'd have to know how Well, you won't know that your FC firmware causes gyro aliasing through mistimed reads and blows up ESCs until you try it @Emilia (XT90 Janklet) that's true. but now you've told them smh the more I think about it, the more I'm leaning on ardu   I want to build a lot of custom stuff on top of it Ardu is basically just a clean slate, you can put whatever you want on top of it that's the plan, looking at a transmitter that switches between 900 and 2.4 which is pretty cool might use that Yeah the gemx stuff is cool, but afaik none of it has a screen, so you'd have to deal with the ELRS settings system as well @Bart that's fine, you can run scripts and also pair it with a companion computer for more complex tasks writing a good FC is just really hard"
"FYI just in case you decide to do your own FW Motors hate large amplitude + high frequency throttle changes.  Most ESCs don't care. FC sends high frequency throttle changes? Let's do high frequency throttle changes.   Motor drops impedance as if it was at max load, ESC can only handle the max load for so long, and eventually something pops.","yea that's the issue, not many guides on it surprised no one's built something like with with a decent enough tutorial to start with   was gonna just find someone to build the prototype then I take over from there There are some ppl who did yea I don't think I'll build my own FC https://github.com/cruwaller/elrs_handset No guides but plenty documentation and code available to do anything you could want https://github.com/kkbin505/Arduino-Transmitter-for-ELRS. https://github.com/danxdz/simpleTx_esp32 the main things I'm tryna do for a base is    - View telemetry on Steam Deck - View Video Feed - Flight Map coordination  - Selection launch height  - Return to Home  basic stuff https://github.com/kaack/elrs-joystick-control. LOL yea was looking at this idk why they connect the ELRS module through a USB-UART tho. it literally has that on board xD I saw a GitHub where a guy uses an Arduino to talk to the ELRS  the ERLS had an Arduino onboard already ELRS doesn't have an arduino onboard.. the one he was using did. sorry it was an esp32 on it yeah (practically) all ELRS transmitters use ESP32's. as the brain and was using another esp32 to communicate with kt btw you can repurpose an ELRS Receiver to work as a Transmitter. and there are some receivers that have like a 500mW amp :KEKw:. just in case you wanted to turn up the jank interesting. besides flightime I am looking for super long range. https://www.getfpv.com/radiomaster-nomad-dual-1w-gemini-xrossband-expresslrs-module.html Idk but a steam deck for lr doesn't seem very reliable to me eh it's mainly just to display info and send commands"
will this be your first drone?,"Interface with Apple-brand underpowered chip. amazing give it a few years and arduino will use the same margins apple does. lol ah, if you mean arduino, yeah that shit is overpriced"
how would you control the drone if without ELRS?,"Is this all ok for my goggles by passing control data through mavlink, through the data link that also carries the video feed. we're not talking acro flying tho"
it has a serious enough uplink bandwidth to the drone? didn't know that,"yeah, it's balanced bidirectional. video and telemetry down; control, parameters, mission uploads up. in real use you wouldn't have much uplink bandwidth anyway if it does auto missions. not sure what's the rate for the sticks, might be 50 or lower Hz. similar to mLRS Personally I'd get a powerbank for goggles and just get a xt60 to USB C adapter. Got a 20,000mah one for like $40 I want to avoid that, I don't want to spend extra money buying a controller plus other than using other methods don't provide range it will be hard to get something flying without nice sticks to control it. you're skipping a lot of ""testing"" steps with ardu that way And leaving no way to debug a lot of bits of the system. That's just plain bad practice.. There's Jank, and then there's just plain stupid. Not having a manual reversion mode of control is asking for trouble."
"Source one? For mounting one at the back for example there are lots of prints, but you have 2 so id just zip tie them to the arms","ya lots of prints for single, thats a good tip thanks will try. zip ties are fucking epic"
true might have to adjust once they are added. Why?. What would your answer have been if v3 lol. How important is a smoke stopper really? I tested with a multimeter already,":Harold:. That would've been my response. Multimeter is good but smoke stopper is better, if you're sure everything should work fine, you can try without, but not my fault if it blows up"
"its my first drone I am not sure, but waiting for one to arrive seems, hard.. Like what would make the multimeter analysis faulty? No short no problem right?",Yeah Im also nut sure what's the problem with multimeter testing. But you should at least clean it with iso before plugging it in
"big smoke tester wants your money. thanks for reminding me completely forgot. GPT says that smoketester is better because it tests under operational conditions, which makes sense. However for a drone what circuit is activated when the drone is turned on? Not really a complex circuit board",I mean everything is activated
"I've got a couple quick questions, I'm hoping to get answered. First, can I mix stick style antenna with circular antenna for videos. Second, will a higher mah battery damage the drone, or is it just the volts that matter. Third, how drastically will a better antenna change video to a fat shark recon echo?","Analog or walksnail for the best overall experience which one. in reality though, any mainstream digital solution will look better than analog. and perform better in most ways. By stick style I assume you mean linear"
define perform... is any display without a degauss button even worth owning?,"1. you'll have some loss trying to receive a linear signal with a circularly polarized antenna but it's perfectly fine 2. mAh just refers to the capacity of the battery, I would recommend you just read this entire page thoroughly for your own safety: <https://oscarliang.com/lipo-battery-guide/> 3. the fatshark echo doesn't have a great receiver, so you'd probably get diminishing returns. if it has hello kitty on it... :meowthsees:. maybe just put some stickers on there hell yeah esc and FC sounds when plugged into battery. full send dont trust big smokestop"
"Analog is cheaper but is the latency difference, in your opinion, noticeable?","now I need to ziptie the roof onto it It's noticeable of course, but it is not something the average person would notice unless you're switching between them frequently.. whether the latency matters or not depends on what you're doing Yeah. Ah one more question, any good charger for a xt30 battery that won't over charge them, I can charge em without worries. really read that LiPo guide but yes. chargers are pricey. <https://vitroidfpv.com/equipment/charging> (+ Hota T6)"
"Thank God, so it is a safe choice. ?","yup, unless you're racing"
Is the vro3 goggles by betafpv any good? Or should I just get the one in the beginner shopping list,they're worse than normal ev800d Can/does analog have the same/better range & penetration as digital Analog has worse penetration. It has good range relative to your equipment. I've been able to get 250m away with my analog tinywhoop
Is walksnail light? Like for example can it fit on tinywhoops without adding too much weight like hdzero does?,Like a 75mm or 85mm 2s. I think there was some issues with walksnail and 1s
"I think I might go analog, check buying advice for reasoning. Do you think you could check out our convo in #shopping-advice and try and poke holes in it? I am really anxious I will overspend and regret",yes. you can do a awesome 75mm if you know what you're doing
I'm not getting any info from PSD I can see what the cam sees but not like gps info etc. put in my gep rc tern. DJI 03 air unit it originally had a analog system anything I need to do?,What is the fps on the cobra xs
Has the DJI Osmo 5 Pro the Same size like the Osmo4 ? Just to know if i need a other case,"has anyone had the problem that the vista doesnt conect to cams anymore. i dint crash it or anything it just dint work one day I binded my elrs reciever to my remote. When I remove power my remote says ""telemetry lost"" when I connect power it says ""telemetry recoverd"".

Please help Get a photo of the wiring between the receiver and FC, and screenshots of the Ports and Receiver tabs in Betaflight Configurator. Swap the TX and RX wires. It should be RX-TX and TX-RX. Not RX-RX and TX-TX Okay. Ah legend! Thanks I appreciate it a lot!!"
Do you mean the action?,Yeah they have the same sensor size
So then This would fit in my Bandooproof Mount from my Action4?,"Maybe, the sensor size is the same but idk about the actual size of the camera. You would have to check DJIs website"
"hey guys, i have a few questions :pensive_face: so sorry im very new to fpv drones 1. would a speedybee vtx work with a mamba fc? 2. would 4.9 ghz vtxs work with 5.8 ghz goggles? 3. do vtxs and receivers have any compatibility factors for them to work with each other?","The vtx and vrx should have the same system and same frequency, then they're compatible 4.9Ghz VTXs are gonna be illegal almost everywhere. They're made for places where legality is not as important. But yes, any VTX will work with any FC regardless of brand, it just needs to have the necessary connections i see guys, thank you sm!"
@eli how did you hear about the 4.9GHz thing?,"honestly i was just looking for available vtxs in my country lmao and i saw a 4.9ghz one, had no idea it was illegal or anything"
What’s the recommended amps for a 8s 5” freestyle esc?,"also requires antennas that are tuned for that. and the VRX might not receive it any ideas as to what's causing this, front motors periodically die out and then respin and the back ones keep ramping up in rpm even when I don't give it throttle. motors cut out when just armed as well it expects to have props to move itself. When it doesn't have props it can't move itself. And so it will do unexpected things. as long as the motors spin up fine manually via the motors tab, it's fine hmm, i tried a test flight with props and it just flipped over forwards"
what dominator goggles? im pretty sure theyre crappy compared to the other stuff you can find. they will come with a pair of bad antennas and its usually suggested you always buy new ones for most goggles like that,"No Fat Shark product is relevant or worth buying new in 2024, and very few are worth buying used"
arent dominators hdzero?,Never power up anything without antennas
why ? and which antenas should i get,"The ""HDO3"" are actually digital goggles for the Avatar/Walksnail system, very poorly named and marketed. Do not buy keep in mind its just going to be for flying close range for now idk why i said hdzero :loudly_crying_face: goggles are fine to power without antennas, but most everything else isnt"
ohh shit thanks is there a way to ad an analog module ?,It's still good practice to just have antennas on everything when turning it on. And he will get super trash signal without antennas
what is going to happen with batteries that have stayed for a long time in a voltage other than storage?,"^. C rating also. edventually theyre useless possibly puffing, too is there another type off analog google that isnt the box type Skyzone SKY04X Pro are a much better buy than anything Fatshark sells i got the 04x pro and its awesome, but its 500 bucks Sky04x pro if you have the money But it comes with a VRX built in, and actually has a decent DVR, actually has nice face-fit, and isn't from a shitty company Only thing that's bad is the customer support the vrx is really pretty nice, although i have one vtx not compatible with the mix modes. customer support for manufacturers usually sucks The same fucking goggle from Fatshark, the so-called ""HDO+"", still has the same crappy DVR they've always had, *NO STOCK VRX*, and fits your face like a brick, and it's *still* more expensive than the SKY04X although betafpv was better than i expected the dvr on the 04x i was impressed with. actually. the thing i was most impressed with was the button and roller based ui. its phenomenal I wish I had experience with the UI. I've only heard good things. Fatshark's don't even have a ui my fatshark transformers had a few buttons but each button would just do one function, no ui Yeah you can navigate through the ui so fast"
just saw them and they look so good the fact that they have vrx means that they are ready to use iff i get the beta fpv air 65 ?,"theres basically one bar at the top that lets you pick mix, channel, and band, and a record button for dvr, and then theres a menu for each side you can open up, one for input settings and one for all the other settings yep, ready to go. the antennas arent great but they will work. i spent another hundred bucks on antennas lol, but you dont need to 40 bucks for a good pair of omni would be perfect what antenas should i get in the futre But the lumenier axii 2 or whatever were worth it Lumenier AXII 2 long range bundle is a great value IMO i think i have a set of lollipops, a set of og triumphs, and a single axii micro OG triumphs were goat for so long bro. I love those antennas. I still have a few. I'm debating about getting a pair of those double axii omnis for my LR stuff"
"I even have some fatsharks, got them when I bought some used stuff. Lumenier?","still have one on my 5"", even after it went into a pond Yea this guy https://pyrodrone.com/products/lumenier-double-axii-2-long-range-5-8ghz-antenna-rhcp i just havent bothered to buy a new one since its durable and it just works i just found the lumenier fro just 20 pounds on ali express ohhh i saw those, i wasnt sure if they were actually any good Gonna be a flat donut lol"
oh so they wont work well if they arent pointed straight up?,"They r nice. Basically an updated better more durable version of the VAS sky hammer.(I think that's what its called.) Yea I greatly prefer lower dBi on the air-side, these would be more for the ground station I got those + one with 90 sma + another lumenier with 1 antenna hat thingy + some other antennas and faaar more stuff for around 65$"
"i think i have a lollipop on my goggles rn, those would be better im guessing?","Lollipops are decent. I think the SWR is a little higher, but they're still good"

"super specific and basic question, but i know a lot of quads are measured by prop diameter, like a 5"" has 5"" prop diameter. Why are some tinywhoops measured by motor to motor distance?? Like 75mm tinywhoops have 31mm props??. how do you know which to use when??. like how do you know if a 2"" quad is motor to motor spacing or prop size?","I actually have that charger lol Once upon a time all quads were measured by wheelbase (motor spacing), and it was ridiculous because you never new what prop size they were meant for. Two quads with the same motor spacing could be for different prop sizes because they were laid out differently Tbh i kinda wish they were all measured by prop size, and i used to call whoops by that Its 31mm and 40mm for whoops yea idk why whoops are special and dont have to follow the prop size standard Because at that size we don't really care about prop size. They are so constrained on weight and thrust that referring to them by wheelbase (because they are always true-x layout) is easier to identify the ""class"". There just never were that many different wheelbase sizes for whoops, so it was never easier to talk about them in terms of prop size. Where 5"" quads could be 180mm, 200mm, 220mm, 250mm, etc but like then it gets confusing when there're things like a squished x or DC tinywhoops. like the fractal 75 or flywoo firefly"
Why are so many people have this issue. Is there a universal solution for this?,Can anyone help me with this or tell me why it's doing this. I checked and all of the motors are on correctly. yeah. https://discord.com/channels/536623076796923924/1144570522991067146. there's a faq for it

Fc orientation, motor ordering, motor direction in bf, actual motor direction, and prop direction are all issues. People don't realize how many different things can cause it, some people don't even realize prop direction matters. Ive seen props upsidedown It's all in the FAQ :p It's easy to screw up, it's easy to miss something, they're basic things that people think they have set correctly and they don't and then they *insist* that they did and you go around for hours telling them to check the stupid thing and they *insist* they're correct until they *finally fucking check it* and ""oh look it was wrong teehee thanks"" yep. i just spent days diagnosing my whoop oscillation and it wound up being my rx antenna was touching the frame im trying to bind this sat recv to this spektrum dx7s find a youtube tutorial man, its going to be a lot faster than anyone here helping you tbh. i dont know a single person here that flies spektrum, and if you dont have a bind plug then you better figure out a substitute. not to be *that guy* but spektrum actually sucks bind plug is just any connection. or as well. ""could've been aa button"" its a 3 prong jumper that connects the two furthest pins couple things, it was free. and it was from one of my best friends whom passed away, i remember when he bought this trex250 came to my house, and promptly crashed it and broke the swash plates stuff, lol. and he left it to me so im getting it working again.. i garuentee he is looking down on me and laughing at this moment because he could do it in 5 seconds. i think i have a dupont f to f jumper i might be able to use it was free but now it shall take you hours"
thr is short for throttle. is there a flight controller on there?. im not experienced with helis,"3gx mrs. stock for this heli if this is what i think it is, it will work. never heard of it haha. https://discord.gg/SPKQGHYU it may take a bit to get to you, but im certain theres several people with large helis and years of experience in this server np, hope you get it sorted im thinking, the only way the flightcontroller could possible be powered is by throttle channel, as the battery is plugged into the esc im gonna have to go in a minute for an exam, but a picture of the wiring would help. its possible that the reciever is setup to produce a serial output from the throttle channel and power the fc from it. sometimes those recievers have pwm outputs and can also be set up for serial. thats a bind plug, the one on the left is what you would need. i think it just connects the thr channel to gnd"
why is the cobra x beter than evds?. /in what ways,"Far better receiver. Way, way, way, way more comfortable. smaller, better screen, better fov. all of it basically"
"i see. also is cetus x, just the drone any good. ?. or what similar 2s drones are out there that are good","it isn't. and it's only 2s to compensate for being bad Hey kinda absurd question inbound.  Has anyone come up with a unique way to control a drone other than a typical controller. Expo is a cool idea and a lot of people have mastered it, but for a beginner linear just makes more sense. But the issue with linear when using a typical controller is you lose a lot of precision with micro adjustments. It’s similar to using mouse and keyboard vs controller in video games.. There is the motion sensors from dji but heard mixed reviews on them You're supposed to always have the radio on if the drone is on, radio on first and off last, but in reality it doesn't matter much. Radio first on, radio last off Why does linear make more sense for a beginner"
the warning says dont charge them in there?,"Yeah I forgot to add “to me”. Like I said, a lot of people have mastered expo but for me linear makes more sense because gimbal movements result in more predictable drone movements. The best analogy I can give is that I grew up playing video games and for many games, stick acceleration was not recommended due to the unpredictable nature. For me, it’s the same with flying a drone. Like I said, a lot of people have mastered expo and are remarkably accurate but for me as a beginner, linear makes more sense and I can predict what the drone is about to do much better.. Again, the vast majority of the fpv community including racers use expo and there are good reasons for that. I’m not saying one is better. I am just saying for me learning fpv, linear rates has helped me better control my drone.. ^ reply to ur message as well Expo and acceleration are different. I can see your point though What is TEL on the FC honestly I'd say that the expo ""unpredictability"" is only a thing if you're *brand spakin new* to fpv. past that, I think it's objective to say that expo simply gives you higher micro adjustment resolution at any given rate. not like after 50 hours you'll still feel like the drone is flying unpredictably. I think the biggest factor is just being familiar with your specific rates. Not a problem to try different rates/expos when you're beginning, but when you *really* start fine-tuning, try to stick with one. I think I started with low rates (like, 200 something probably) and linear at first but still transitioned to around 800 deg/sec and plenty of expo That all makes sense. I’m gunna give it another go. I’m using 667 as my max right now. i see what youre saying about acceleration but it isn't the same for a very specific reason. I'll use mouse acceleration for example because im on pc, but i would assume stick acceleration is the same. when you move the mouse a certain distance, without acceleration, your cursor or crosshair is going to move an exact amount, every time. with acceleration, the movement will depend on speed and not on the physical distance the mouse moved irl. With or without expo on a quad, your finger position still relates to an exact number in deg/s. Adding expo or changing rates in general changes that number, but your physical finger position still corresponds to an exact number every single time, and it allows you to build muscle memory for it. If the number were to change dependent on how fast you moved the stick, then it would be bad, but that isn't what expo does.. i got the chance to program my own control curves from scratch for robotics in highschool. it was kinda neat because for whatever reason most other teams didnt bother and just went linear. i used desmos to create the function that i wound up putting into the program. my first goal was to remove anything I didn't use, because the more usable stick range you have, the more accurate you can be. that's why i made the curve higher at the bottom, low stick deflection wouldnt even move the robot. then the mid range i wanted more accuracy in so I lowered the slope, and then at the high range I was likely to going flat out anyway so I sacrificed the loss in accuracy there. Yeah this makes total sense the only really unique thing i can think of is camera tilt controlled by head tracking on some fpv quads Well you all convinced me to give it a shot again, thank you everyone I have a rado master boxer that i got today i did a dumb and only have 3.6v 18650s i ordered new ones as its a must that you use 3.7 batterys would i be able to use the boxer jsut through usbc in like a flight sim or something while i wait no no no cancel the order :face_with_tears_of_joy:. your 3.6 batteries are just fine man put em in the radio and turn it on. its fine there is a litteral waring in the charging bay that they cause a fire and whats the warning say quote DO NOT charge 6.6v LiFE or 3.6v Li-ion cells. in a yellow red box ohhhhhhhhhh shit you know what i think youre right. i kinda forgot about that. theyll work but you cant charge them there i hope my t15 isnt like that xD but i dunno if i can jsut plug in asubc and i can jsut fly sime for a bit. cna i do that. a usbc Send us a pic of the cells u have now and a link to where u ordered them.  You can probably use them for now temporarily but also ensure the radio only ever charges them to say 75% if usb is connected for sim. you can try it without the batteries of course, it wont damage it. dont let the radio charge all the way. it will over charge the batteries. anything over 4.1v is to much and the radio will do 4.2 if i plug the radio in whith no batts a red light jsut comes on"
Press and hold power button breifly. That do anything?,"no. sometimes it blivks red then solid Cant run on usb only then dam. liek when i plug it in with no batts a hear it conenct to pc then 3 sec later discconect. and repeat Some remotes have to be on before USB connection in order to make the proper connection for use. k. ima jsut wait for the batts to come I odnt trus my self to only chrage then a certain percent. wait will me putting the batts in damamge the controller. or is it just that the batts can exsplode youre fine to have them in there, its just charging that goes kablooey The risk comes in if you overcharge the Batteries. thats why i was saying theyre fine at first. if you had a different charger it would be no problem okay the only way of charing tha t i have is through the controller. hmm. i do have a powersupply and  a 18650 holder how do i cahrge them. adjustable power supply do you have a *charger*. none of those items are chargers. the other thing is if you sim, it will charge yeah. so only frone flying Measure cell voltage. Say its 3.65. Set charger to 3.66 at .5A. Wait till cell reaches 3.66 Repeat process till cell reaches 4.1 :Harold:. this would work. its painful However if you are connecting by USB for a sim. You don't even want a fully charged pack I’ve been charging to 4.2v"
do you have 3.7v batteries?,I thought 4.2v was fine You could make larger jumps for sure. Just an example.  But def very small jumps is the way to go and how a dedicated charger circuit works. (VS  psu) lemme send you the batts i have for 3.7v batteries. not for 3.6 Older liions were 4.1 max. You probably have modern 4.2 ones. I’m so confused. I have 18650s some 18650s are rated at a lower voltage
so these work with the controller?. with no boom?,"Yeah theese are 3.6 so 4.1 max. Your options for now, assuming you just wanna connect by usb for a sim are:  A: wait for 3.7/4.2 cells.   B: use your existing cells but do not let it get above 4.1 when connected by usb.  Using perhaps your 18650 tray and some external load to discharge the cells once USB sim time has charged them up. Or just leave the radio on to drain the battery overnight or something."
the 18650 battery store lists 4.2v max. @Llama whatcha think. https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/bak-n18650cnp?srsltid=AfmBOoqLG-KKqI9CKLV8fVJoe5UQrVQh1vyISn96LCclMb6OLZZOWRrx. i think it might be fine,i mean what i could do iss extend the elnght of the charging bay cables have that outisde of the remote i have heat shirnk solder and cable. becuse the 18650 bay jsut has a ph2.0 connector. meke cable longe thus away from controller if it were me id say whatever and run it. def check if theyre warm after charging all the way. one charge wont blow them up. maybe 3.6 just means they have a lower center/lower discharge voltage. 2.5 instead of 3 like a lipo
Looks fine from the spec sheet. So long as said cells are not knockoffs.  But yeah if it was me I'd charge them once under a close eye to 4.2 at 0.5C and if they didn't get warm from that charge then they are def fine and I'd probably treat them same as other 18650. Then why not just make a long extension cable from your PSU into the radio and use it to power it?,the olny wai i have to charge is through the controller. i could but scketchy. i use step down converters Leave back pannel off and feel them for temp as it charges. Oh then........... Not a PSU..... :man_facepalming: self made on lol. one. the 24v is from a satnadrd psu the step down makes it adjustable
If you don't trust it to power a 60$ radio. Then. What do you trust it to power?,"$ 200 stepper motors. how hot is too hot. becuse they get warm slightly always when charging Like a few deg F above ambient is fine. More is concern. Hot is :grimacing_face: if it would be remotely uncomfortable, its bad k. btw it dont charge while sim filying. bruh. time to get a yt vid on the side and watch it. no if i put it in the bottom it cahrges but doent conenct to my pc if I but it int he top no more pc but it charges. theres two usbc ports. you could prolly search it up Yeah that's def how some radios r. ima charge each on only to 3.8v. so thats 7.6v. uhh on my drone i move the sticks in beta and my throttle is like my pitach and stuff how do i fix this"
is it possible to hook up SPeedyBee TX800 VTX to Betafpv F722 35A AIO?,Yes. Follow the diagram on the right. I guess both of them really. Its an analog vtx. Sa=irc. Wire your camera right to the fc
"Can the iMax B6 charger charge an HV battery to 4.35 volts per cell? I understand its bad reputation for being a firestarter and all, so please skip discussing that. I specifically want to know if it can charge cells upto 4.35volts.","It can often times do so even when not set to HV. On a more serious note... It depends on which B6 you have. Some can do HV, some cannot"
"how do I find out which B6? my B6's model number is ""QC Passed"" :grinning_squinting_face:","Some B6's have a LiHV mode @Sunil. on others you need to edit the LiPo mode target voltage haven't seen that mode in mine, I'll try the second option then Then hold it with your hand you could try grab it with some pliers with something soft in between like a rag to prevent scratching Or with a cloth or something with a lot of friction FYI You can significantly reduce its bad reputation by improving its cooling. Assuming it's the version that doesn't have a fan. Believe me it doesn't work, it just slides anyway Huh. How did you overtighten it that much Also tried screwing in a screw on the bottom to try to hold it in place, but then that screw just unscrews when you screw the screw on the top. I think it will just slide anyway like the smaller one did. But ye, can try one I home The screw went in there, it'll come back out. Just a matter of how much force you have to apply.  Or you'll shear the head off, either way :PepeShrug:"
"I have an issue with my transmitter. I have a jumper tlite and for some reason it suddenly doesnt take me to the main screen. I hold the power button, it calls out edgetx and then the LED goes red and says my throttle isnt 0 when it clearly is. When I ignore the warning the main screen isnt working and I cant navigate. The backlight is also turned off, its on when bottong but then goes off. Anyone know what the issue is?",your sd card is dying and corrupted. the exact same thing happened to me. a while ago are you sure its brand new. Got it maybe 3 weeks back and have done a flight a day with it mine did it straight away aswel. the sd cards they some with suck yes but I got a new one and replaced the old one. the transmitter itself is over a year old. sorry should have clarified that the sd card is brand new the transmitter was bought in 2022
well maybe you just go unlucky. do you have a backup fo the sd card contents?,yes I have the old sd card somewhere make sure to have a backup bc its kind of annoying to get all the sd card contents from scratch and then have to set up your radio again
"the edge tx bin file is on the radio itself, the sd card has all of the models, sounds, scripts and radio setup. strange. if you plug the sd card into a pc does it say its corrupt or that you have to format it before use?",no both cards detect fine and can view all of the files nothing appears wrnog with either
"that's super strange, when I had your exact problem windows would always freak out about the SD card then I would just format it and put back all the files from a backup and then it would last a few weeks before it got corrupted again and eventually died altogether.. i could send you the sd card contents from my tlite so see if that changes anything?","that would work. One thing I want to note is that when I plug my tlite into my laptop it doesnt seem to recongize it. I get no prompts on my laptop andnnothing happens on my tlite either. Same edgetx voice then no backlight, menu bugged. cant even enter dfu. although bootloader does show"
How do i charge in the box?,"Make an extension cable. Poke it through the grommet with extension cables or by putting the charger inside as well Oh so have it slightly open. Also what are the two rubber things on the inside no, the plag puck is where you put the cables through Ah ok. Why is yours upside down. And what if i dont have extension cables You need to make or buy some. Also what do you mean upside down or place the charger inside Hmm. It can go either way I think Ok. Also whats the other cable that plugs into the charger That’s the balance connector wont hurt to just connect it and see if it works. if it doesnt then add a capacitor ah, shouldn't require extra components What does it do i do i need it plugged it"
Is the antenna fucked or will some hestshrink be enough?,"It’s critical, please read the Oscar Liang article about lipo safety and charging if the wire isnt cut then its fine Yes i have been. I was told 45W should charge it The balance connector lets the charger tell what voltage each cell is at, and lets it charge and discharge each cell separately to balance the pack. Ah that makes sense. I cant seem to get the eire in. Like throught the top. Of the rubber part You pull the rubber part out, sandwich the cable, then push the rubber back in"
"if im unplugging things from my FC, is it just a pull out or does the plug have a latch or something?","those look like handles to pull on. depends on what FC you have Yes but i need to put the wire in from the top down and mines backwards. Also whats fully charged. For 4s So you didn’t read the article I did. And im going back to remember. :saluting_face: simple plugs, but they might have a dot of glue on them to keep them in (You don’t need to remember every charged voltage because the charger displays individual cell voltages too) wiggle them with tweezers Ok so my charger delivers a max of 200W and my cable does 45W. So thats cool I haven't seen a flight controller with latching plugs in literally years all the newer Pixhawks have them Ok, I haven't seen a *Betaflight* FC with latching plugs in literally years. Pixhawk is its own class that we rarely see or talk about here. But you're technically correct, so congrats I guess it's not a competition. just a reminder that things look differently in the prosumer segment Just wanted to double check that everything is correct. Cause it all looks good to me. But im a paranoid person"
"Are you charging a 1,000mAh 4S lipo?","1C x 2300mAh -> 1C x 2.3Ah -> 2.3A. But you can charge slower if you want. It'll just take longer Thats the calculation been needing that. So i set the current setting to 2.3A Ok thks. And its charging tysm and 4.2 * 4 * 2.3 is well below the 45W of your supply. so you're good there, too"
Does it make a noise when its finished?. Or do i jist have to check,"most likely it will beep a few times By default it should beep when the quick charge is complete, and then beep again when the balance cycle is complete Can it get to 4.2V before getting to 2300mAh. They are all at 4.2V do not drill or any sanding with carbon. unless it's underwater. carbon dust is insanely dangerous. that looks like it has 20x20 mounting holes though, what frame is that Yes, there is a quick charge cycle that gets it to 4.2V, then a balance cycle that will trickle them full Ah ok so if it says there over 4.2 thats pk. Like slightly over A couple of hundredths is not unusual > VTX Mounting：30.5\*30.5 φ3mm / 25\*25 φ1.6mm / 20*20 φ2mm. moonlight can mount on both 25x25 and 20x20 Ok cause theyre all at 4.203,4,5 Oh psh yea millivolts are fine, nw there So now i wait until it gets to 2300mAh"
Storage charge 3.7. Ish. Althought storage is 3.85 no?,"It'll never reach 2300mAh then. 3.7V is like 45% full Oh ok. So i just need to wait for a beep to know its done you *should* be able to use either okk ok, i assumed the other ones were just holding the vtx together They are. But they can pull double-duty, you'd just need to use longer bolts. I'd recommend using the 20x20 standoffs if at all possible though. Speak of the devil it has just beeped so i shall just turn it off and unplug it i presume"
Is the current readout at 0.0A?. It could,"I stuffed a moonlight into my Source One V5 and it is definitely a tight fit. If the charger says its done and the current reading is 0.0A, then it's done Why is it upside down idk uɐᴉlɐɹʇsn∀ pɐǝɹ uɐɔ I ʎlᴉʞɔn˥ hmm alrighty, I'll keep that in mind I like you lol. Bros got jokes love it. I got my goggles working. Hooray. Do i need to have lenses in. Also why is band L differant to all the others"
Steadyview X receiver?. L band is ~5.3GHz iirc,"Ahh so differant band is differant frequency. I cant work out how to get into the osd menu Yes. It's not included on this chart, but this is a good reference Nvm worked jt out. I also found the led light bar settings so im having lots of fun"
is there even a name for those 4.9GHz that lots of new VTXes seem to go down to?,"Foxeer refers to them as H, L, U, O and X but it's worthless, those bands are illegal pretty much everywhere, and you need a special VRX too of course, and new antennas I think the reasons why these exist are obvious like those 3GHz VTXes ehhhh 3.3G is a legal band in some places Honestly at that point just go 1.3GHz 3.3ghz video can work with 2.4ghz radio, but 1.3 can’t i doubt many would run 2.4GHz radio when they also run 1GHz video"
"Christmas is coming, I might ask for an air65 to fly when it's cold outside, is there a (not too dangerous) way to charge 1s lipos with a 2-6s charger?","yes, but a ViFly Whoopstor 3 is not much cheaper than that way vifly whoopstor will safe you enough time to warrant the extra 15 bucks you'd spend on it"
"The air65 has a linear antenna, right? Will I get better signal with linear or rchp antennas on my goggles?. I have the linear antennas that came with the 04x pro, idk if they're good enough",that is a very complicated question. yes in a clean environment you would get better signal with matching antennas. but wifi and other stuff also uses linear antennas so things can get very funny. tl;dr just don't worry they're fine Ok so I guess I'll just try out what I have and use what works best
What are the black and white ones with the container for and do i need them and can I cut them off????,"they're to control the camera settings. if you have a spare uart, wire it to that"
its going to the speedybee f405 V4 55s stack. dose it need to be wired to anything?,"yes, if you have a spare uart then you wire it to that"
so your telling me sence i dont have a uart or what its called my camrea wont work?,I'm sure he has a free uart if he doesn't know what it is im new and my FC only has 4 spots on it to wire analog I said. # IF. you have a. # SPARE. UART. you should wire it up to that. so a spare TX* pad
you see the TX and RX's on the flight controller?. each numbered tx and rx is a uart,so to wire up that white wire on the camera. you would wire it to a spare TX
R3 and t3 should be free. Wait. @Emilia (XT90 Janklet). Why use a uart?. When there's a CC pin,That's what I soldered today (although I need to adjust some settings so it works properly). I think he can connect the osd pin to the cc pin and should be fine. If the standard bf settings work wouldn't the cc pin just be a uart I don't think it is. I'll look it up. Doesn't say anything about a cc being a uart. And I also didn't have to enable any extra uart. Iirc the bf documentation also says nothing about cc having something to do with uart. In the cli it appears as the camera_control resource. @Tungsten360 you can solder the osd wire to the cc pin. It's next to the cam pin
ok what about the ground?,"thet is 2 grounds wires lol Yeah. Ground to ground. Always. Ground is everywhere the same you probably don't have to wire both ground wires Yeah the ground wire for the osd is useless don't need it, just take the pin out Ok thank you everyone No, it does not come with a female-female cable. You will need to solder *something* even if it is splicing wires together. I remember when it wasn't :loudly_crying_face: I mean, if you're using the joystick then it isnt"
is this solder ok? the 2 bigger balls are touching slightly,"What should i set for discharge What solder are you using, what flux are you using and what iron are you using. because it kind of looks like you didn't heat up the pad at all, and directly applied the solder to the iron tip instead of the pad"
For storage charge it 3.75V isnt it so what settings?. Nvm theres a specific setting for storage charge,"I love when people ask if it's okay if 2 pads are touching if theyre touching, theyre conducting.. right lmao Like it'd not be the same as just twisting all you're wires together ad soldering them to one pad but like, congrats youve just grounded your signal wire. take a wild guess as to whats going to happen I guess it's a great way to test your smoke stopper if you have 5v and ground shorted yeah. for signal, i assume it just doesnt work. not sure if itll fry anything but i dont think it usually does. i didnt even look at what they had in the pic you never know:Harold:"
