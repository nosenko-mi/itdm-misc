"What frame are you running?  Which propellers?  What craft AUW?

I have very similar setups built as racers, that perform brilliantly on both BF3.5.7 and BF4.1.1.  Even super-notchy 1408 motors on aggressive 3052F props can fly quite cleanly.

In terms of tunes and filters, both are nearly stock tunes and fly well, at most some filter adjustments to compensate for the higher RPM that naturally comes with 3"" craft.
",Tuning with notchy motors on Betaflight,"I'm having trouble tuning a custom 3-inch build on Betaflight.  I can't get general vibrations to go away.  I'm using RC in Power 1506 4100KV motors on 4S.  These are very notchy motors.  I've been told notchy motors are difficult to tune.  Are there any pointers out there for such a build with notchy motors?  

I've tried several versions of Betaflight 3.5.7 through 4.1.  I've turned down the filtering and the motors stay cool.  I've tweaked the PIDs a lot and it hasn't helped much.  I've even changed to a completely different Frame to get rid of any possible resonance.  I've tried soft mounting the FC, and hard mount.  TIA

"This depends on your version of QX7. 

If it is ACCESS, then, as far as I know, there is currently no way to enable D8.

If it is ACCST FCC, it should already have D8 enabled by default, so it is unlikely to be this model.

If it is ACCST LBT, then when updating the radio, when selecting the features, you can enable D8 mode by selecting the appropriate checkboxes as shown in this video by Whirly Bloke: Video

"I've actually posed this question to an FAA Safety Team employee. These guys are top notch and know their specific field of speciality, however there is an important nuance which needs to be understood work respect to his answer.

Also, I posited the question from a slightly different perspective, however I would be highly confident that this answer would apply to your question. I emailed and asked an FAA Safety Team employee (as opposed to one of the hard to differentiate FAA Safety Team Volunteers) that if the FAA chooses to levy enforcement action(s) upon an FAA Private, Commercial, or ATP certified pilot as a result of this pilot committing a violation of a defined FAA regulation while the pilot was operating under 14CFR  Part 91, could the enforcement action be extended to other FAA issued certificates held by the pilot such as a 14CFR Part 145 Airframe &amp; Powerplant (A&amp;P) Aircraft Mechanic Certificate or a 14CFR Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate.

Having held some form of FAA certification for over well over 3 decades, was certain I know what the answer would be, because I had heard it time and time again. And the FAA Safety Team employee responded with exactly what I thought, absolutely. But like I stated before, this ""absolutely"" carries with it a number of very important caveats.

First, while I appreciated the response, the response is consistent with all previous answers received when the question has been answered, the truth is that individual's answer to me is just barely better than conjecture. How could that be, he's a no kidding, Federal Paycheck receiving FAA Civil Servant employee, how in the hell could I suggest that his answer was anything but The FAA's version of divine intervention?

Because his job title sounds like the right guy, but he's not the got who would be making the decision, it had likely ever made that type of decision. The FAA Safety Team managers are primarily tasked with spreading the good word, about safety. They coordinate all the Safety Seminars, they can be asked to provide recurrent training to those who have been violated, but that's them doing a favor for a colleague, the colleague who actually wields the stick of enforcement. 

Those individuals are called FAA Safety Inspectors. They are the highest authority, above all the Designated Inspectors, when it comes to taking a practical flight exam. If you're a drone pilot and you're unsure if that tell, here's an opinion most won't like to hear. For every single pilot certification, applicants are required to show a 70+ on a proctored 60 - 100 question written exam (should sound familiar). But then, they are required to sit across from either a Designated Examiner or FAA Safety Inspector at a table and answer up to 3 hours worth of direct verbal worsening (called the oral exam, but that's a bit salacious to use), and then followed by what's called the Practical Exam. Based on what specific pilot certification, rating, or type certificate being sought, the practical exam Soraya takes place in the air flying an aircraft the applicant is familiar with and usually lasts over an hour performing a series of requisite manuevers which must be demonstrated within a defined set of standards.

These FAA Safety Inspectors are a group of FAA employees who are in no way affiliated with the FAA Safety Team managers, falling under a completely separate division, or what the FAA colloquially calls a separate ""Line of Business"", or LOB. 

I've been told my entire career that even my A&amp;P could legally, and in some cases would be suspended for serious enough violations being enforced upon a completely unrelated certificate. 

However, the second caveat is FARRR now important to fully understand when you are pondering such things. The FAA always has been, always will be, and will do everything in it's power to try and indoctrinate the new sUAS crowd, run as a self regulating, honor based system of checks and balances, who will do nearly everything in their power to avoid resorting to issuing violations of certificated pilots. This may seem hard to believe, but trust me, I've been here a while. 

In fact, in my opinion, it takes a pretty special kind of violation of regulations to result in forcing their hand, and even then they will put an emphasis on retraining in lieu of suspensions or revocations of a certificate. There are a few sure ways that they have absolutely no choice, at least from where I stand.

1st, Any violation of the DC-SFRA or Presidential TFR, even popup, they literally have no choice but to suspend your certificate, but also recognize that they will also be advocating on your behalf to the US Secret Service who can get a little trigger happy with the criminal charges.

2nd, Any obvious and willful violations of Class D, Class C, Class B, and/ or Class A airspace, without ATC clearance, and without offering any reasonable justification. This can also happen with repeated, obviously not getting it airspace violations.

3rd, Your violation(s) caused a severe breakdown in the flight safety of your aircraft and any others in the vicinity. If your actions result in the injury of loss of life of other people, your certificates are going to be the last of your problems. I see this being the case the first time a drone operator is foolish enough to get their platform sucked into an engine intake. 22,000 RPM turbine vanes don't have a great record of resiliency in such events, something similar killed 3 people on a Southwest Airlines B-737 a year or so ago.

3rd, If you treat the FAA Safety Investigaters with a heavy dose of wanton disrespect because you're angry they are violating your, they will drop a bookshelf on you and just watch as you struggle to find your footing, and good on them. This bookshelf is of course figuratively speaking and meant to represent worse than getting the book thrown at you. 

Here's the deal, if you're called by an Inspector to discuss some violation you may or may not have committed with a drone or manned aircraft, don't snap into the defensive posture and start to deny deny deny. These folks are absolutely here to figure out what happened, ensure you're aware of the regulations, ensure you're clear on what part of your operation was being investigated as the violation, and how to ensure it won't likely issue again on your watch. They have no desire to suspend or revoke anyone's certificates, because they are fully aware that as is often the case with named pilots, this is often the individual's means of making a living. 

So, the answer is yes, any enforcement actions resulting from any in-flight regulatory violation of one certificate can have detrimental effects on all other certificates.  it could, but the caveat is unless you're really obtuse about or have no intentions of following anyone's roles or regulations

The interesting thing about Party 107 Certificates are the numbers. This actually frustrates me for a number of reasons. Before the Party 107, I have always held at any given time, three separate FAA Pilot Certifications. My Commercial, my Flight Instructor, and my A&amp;P Mechanic certification. Every single one of those really gave no relation to the others, the Instructor Cert being related to Commercial Pilot Cert, I'll concede, but nothing else. Despite these differences, every one of my FAA certificates were adorned with the same number. 

Every single one, except now for my Party 107 Remote Operator Certificate. The rumor was back in the day that this was done many years ago to ensure investigators were aware of all certificates. It's BS because my 107 is listed right next to my Commercial Certification record at the FAA. 

However I'm quite frustrated that the FAA didn't harmonize the pilot databases, as this former alienates the drone members of the industry, and that's asinine. 

I think that answered the question asked. 
",Is it possible to get a FAA Part 107 drone license if one has had a pilot license revoked or suspended?,"A Part 107 license (which requires a knowledge test and background check) is required in order to use a drone commercially in the US.

"You may need new batteries.

When a LiPo battery fully discharges, thin whiskers of lithium metal form between the plates of the battery.  Attempting to recharge the battery will cause these whiskers to overheat, which may cause the battery to catch fire or explode.

Commercial batteries from reputable manufacturers have self-monitoring circuitry that will permanently disable the battery if the charge level drops too low.  If the batteries are of this sort, it's safe to test them by recharging -- if the battery has been damaged by over-discharge, it simply won't take a charge.

Cheap third-party batteries and homemade battery packs don't have this protection.  A battery that's only been sitting for a year may still be good -- I'd try recharging it in the middle of a concrete driveway or some other well-ventilated, fireproof location.  With a battery that's been sitting for three years, I wouldn't risk it.

"You should store the battery fully charged as little as possible; a few days is probably fine, but when it gets closer to a week or more you might start to see it's health degrading.

"The trouble with making a nano drone is that for it to be what is commonly considered a ‘drone’, it needs to be able to be controlled via radio waves and/or be programmed to complete specific tasks.

The trouble this introduces is that to receive radio waves effectively, the receiver antenna needs to be around one-half wavelength (AFAIK), so nano-scale drones are not practical for current technology.

Two very well-known ‘micro’ drones are the Cheerson CX-10 and the Hubsan Q4 H111, both of which are approximately 25mm by 25mm.

"Assuming you can only use up to four motors (because if you used six, eight, or even more you could just lift something with brute force) the most thrust dense configuration would probably be a ducted fan quadcopter. 

The reason for that is ducted fans essentially stop a lot of air from being propelled sideways and more air goes down. Ducted fans can provide more lift and are more efficient than open-prop designs. 

A helicopter would only have one motor and would need to be much larger to provide the same thrust as a quadcopter. Those other configurations mentioned would also not have nearly the thrust of a quadcopter of a similar size. 

So, the best option would be a ducted-fan quadcopter (or hexacopter/octocopter if you can use lots of motors) with oversized motors. A good propeller would be a large prop as it gives more thrust at the expense of maneuverability and acceleration. Wider motors give you more torque but taller motors give you more RPMs so that depends on the prop. (A heavy aggressive prop should go with a wide motor and a lighter prop should be paired with a taller motor)

If you don't really care about longevity, get a powerful ESC, high cell-count battery (probably 6s), and get a motor that is higher than normal KV for maximum thrust and power at the expense of the motor's longevity. But be careful to not go too crazy with the high KV as it could potentially burn out an ESC or destroy the motor.

Also, as durability is not really that important for the purpose of this specific build, make it as light as physically possible (but still rigid, you don't want vibrations or flex) so that it can lift as much weight as possible. 

Hopefully, this helps, as I'm not really sure what all of the requirements of this drone are.

"Two things I can think of could be causing this.

The first is that, whilst your frame bolts are secure, your prop nuts could be loose, so the sudden acceleration of the motor causes slippage.

The second is that your props are flattening under the high RPM. I have only experienced this once but switching to a different set of props solved the issue.

I've binded the receiver to the controller and soldered the positive and negative wires to the board. Left the remaining two wires (one yellow, one light brown) cause I wasn't sure which they are (one is SBUS and one is PPM but not sure which is which). I first connected the board to Betaflight and set it to PPM. Tried connecting one of the wires and was able to get readings from controller. Then I set Betaflight to SBUS and connected the other wire but couldn't get any readings out of it. I tried a few more times with both PPM and SBUS but it just stopped working. After a few trials the receiver stopped beeping and light up when I connected the battery and its temperature became very high within a few seconds.

"Your questions are challenging to answer because (my opinion) I think there is a lot more that goes into a batteries longevity than voltage staying between a certain threshold.  In addition to keeping the voltage in specified ranges, the following also apply.


Do you fly in hot or cold or humid conditions? 
Do you fly hard and fast all the time where your batteries come off the drone warm or hot, or do you take it easy and just fly for leisure?
How long do you let your batteries sit below or above storage charge (3.8V/cell)?
Do you charge your batteries immediately after using them or do you let them sit to cool down a bit (15 minutes or more)?
What brand of battery do you have?  Some are known to be junk, others have a great track record, but some bad batches now and then.
What charger do you use?  Is it reputable?
Do you balance charge?
How old are the batteries?
How often have the batteries been crashed?


My opinion is, and I've been tracking battery usage since 2011, is that despite the claim of 300+ cycles, most LiPos will only last about 100 cycles due to the factors that I mentioned above, which also includes the occasional oops moments when you fly your battery below 3V/cell or on the rare occasion when you forget to put them in storage charge.  On top of that, the number of cycles is highly dependent on the quality of the LiPo.  

To make a long story short, a few mistakes with your batteries every now and then might ""damage"" them, but it shouldn't affect them as much as other factors involved in flying, like crashing and the others that I've listed above.  Generally speaking, if you take care of your batteries, they should last you a while.

I know it's a vague answer that doesn't really hit on your voltage questions, but it's based on many years of experience, so I hope it helps you out.
",What are the conditions for LiPo battery damage from undervoltage?,"It is widely known that Lithium-polymer cells are permanently damaged if their voltage drops below a certain threshold, around 3.0 volts, but I couldn't find much on the exact conditions and factors that regulate how this damage takes place (Which, I suppose, is related to the fact that few other applications dealing with lipos involve remotely as much recklessness as we subject them to).

The first of them is the contribution of voltage drop from internal resistance when the pack is under load. i.e. does the damage begin whenever a current (e.g. from a punchout) dips the pack's voltage, as observed from its terminals, below 3.0V/cell, or does the pack's ""actual"", resting voltage with no current drawn have to get that low?

Second, how fast does the performance of the battery degrade, and at what point does it stop? If voltage gets dropped (via IR) by a high current and it leads to damage, does it stop accumulating immediately as the current is removed and the voltage comes back up? What happens when a battery is discharged so that its resting voltage is below 3.0V, but is quickly charged back up or its voltage naturally bounces back somewhat?

Third, how significant is the time spent by the battery below the threshold versus the very fact of dipping down, i.e. what difference does it make if one rushes to charge an overdrained pack back to an acceptable voltage right after ripping it out of the aircraft (probably from another pack), versus doing it after getting home?

And finally, how does previously sustained damage from over-discharge contribute to further damage?

Note:
Some context regarding how this kind of damage relates to degradation from the other abuse that we subject our cells to would be very much appreciated, although the main focus is still the undervoltage-related damage itself.

"This is probably not the answer you're looking for, but it's an approach to the problem nonetheless.

I prefer to avoid crimping connectors entirely. In part it's because it's a fiddly process even with a specialized crimper, in part it's a (probably superstitious) fear that the mechanical connection is going to be less reliable than a solder joint, so when I do crimp connectors, I tend to also solder the wire to them; it takes seconds and gives me peace of mind.

Now, the only ones that I've actually got a crimper for are the 2.54mm spacing types (there are more than the ones you've mentioned), however even those I tend to just quickly fold over with pliers and then solder over.

The smaller pin spacing types I just avoid entirely. It's cool to be able to do your own, but it's more trouble than it's worth. A handful of pre-crimped cables with these connectors included with any piece of gear that uses them anyway, and if you think it's not going to be enough, you can always order some pre-crimped pigtails (and just solder to the wires). Unless you design your own PCBs and put the corresponding sockets on them, you're unlikely to encounter a piece of gear that has the socket but doesn't have a cable included.

That said, I've only got one drone with a pixhawk FC, which is, as far as I know, the only family of flight controllers that uses these smaller connectors everywhere, and I'm not exactly covering it with sensors and other auxiliary equipment, so I've simply not run out of the cables that came with it. If you did run out of yours, the most economical way I could suggest would be to order an assortment pre-crimped pigtails/cables and use them, however uncool it may be.

Is the shunt resistor usually mounted high-side (i.e. at the positive battery terminal), or low-side (at the negative terminal), and why? Does it matter?  


There should be no significant difference to the measurement if the shunt resistor is on the high or low side. As the resistor is in series the absolute voltage across, and current through, the resistor remains the same. However, there may be a small advantage to one or the other depending your sensor design - for example, having it on the low side makes the measurement relative to the circuit GND, which may reduce the component count of your amplifier/signal conditioning design.


What class of amplifier, in terms of precision, is used for the sensed voltage?  


This will depend slightly on your design, and you may find the precision of the ADC to be the limiting factor (e.g. an 8 bit 5V ADC has a resolution of 19.5mV.) That said, the job of the amplifier is to match the range of values from your sensor to the input range of your ADC. While a linear relationship is intuitive and straightforward, it may be more desirable to have a curve to give greater sensitivity around the expected ranges but still report invalid values with slightly reduced precision. You would need to characterise the curve and program it into your flight controller for correct reporting.


What range of output voltages does the FC expect?


This will depend entirely on the flight controller - but typical ranges for ADCs are 0 to 3.3V or 0 to 5V. Remember that if you want to report a negative reading, you will need to bias your zero value sensor ourput for mid range on the ADC.


Is there any smoothing (lowpass filtering) applied to the sensor's output to reduce aliasing from possible high frequency current ripple?


Filtering is a good idea to help reduce unwanted values. The response time of the filter needs to be fast enough to capture valid changes while rejecting noise. You can compare the filter response rate to your sample rate - your filter response can be slower if you are checking the voltage every 0.5 seconds instead of every 0.05. Alternatively you may decide to do some filtering in software, sampling several times and averaging, but this takes CPU time away from other tasks.
",What are the usual engineering considerations for a UAV current sensor?,"Current sensors are a popular feature in both multicopter and fixed wing flight control stacks. 

Most of them are analog, i.e. convert the current into a voltage using a small-value shunt resistor (and possibly a voltage amplifier). That voltage is then read by the flight controller via an ADC pin. I've been trying to make my own, and in such cases it is useful to know the best practices in the industry, however my Google-Fu was not strong enough to find those, and reverse-engineering is a rather tedious proposition, since I only have an ESC-integrated one. 

The main questions I couldn't find answers to are:


Is the shunt resistor usually mounted high-side (i.e. at the positive battery terminal), or low-side (at the negative terminal), and why? Does it matter? 
What class of amplifier, in terms of precision, is used for the sensed voltage? 
What range of output voltages does the FC expect?
Is there any smoothing (lowpass filtering) applied to the sensor's output to reduce aliasing from possible high frequency current ripple?
If there is any difference between standard sensors used in betaflight FC stacks vs., e.g. APM or PX4 flight controllers, what are they?


If someone could provide a circuit schematic of a ""typical"" current sensor, it would be very much appreciated as well.



Clarification on the purpose of this question:

I'm asking because, while I've got my own ideas about each choice, I have no way of verifying whether I've considered everything in the decisions and the relative importance of all the factors involved (without building one first and seeing how things play out). Thus, I'd like to learn from field-tested commercial designs and see how they solved all these questions.

i.e. my thoughts on where to mount the shunt: Low side is simpler, but if done this way, ripple currents from ESCs may induce voltage ripple in the ground, which is worse than voltage ripple at VBAT, since everything in the drone is connected to it directly as a common terminal, while VBAT typically goes through a regulator before hitting sensitive elements. On the other hand, I may be overthinking the significance of this aspect and it might be fine either way; the best way to learn that would be to see how others do it; if they only mount the resistor high-side (or only do it low-side), then it must be significant, if they don't care I shouldn't care either.

"tl;dr: Your batteries will be perfectly fine well below freezing, and, provided you follow some simple rules, will probably actually live longer if you store them in the cold. But don't ever try charging lithium batteries (any kind) below zero, or they'll die very, very quickly.

Low temperatures do affect LiPo batteries in a number of ways, first and foremost being the increase in internal resistance as the battery gets colder. This is why LiPos need to be warmed up before flying in cold weather, as otherwise they will be able to sustain a much lower discharge current than usual and will not give their full rated capacity:

In flight the current flowing through the pack itself will hopefully generate enough heat internally to keep it warm, though for longer-flying platforms with low current draw (i.e. long-range fixed wing) an onboard heater or thermal insulation may be required to keep the cells warm.
As for damage, it does not occur in storage or while discharging even when a LiPo battery is brought below freezing; the rated temperature range for discharging is -20° to +60°C, and the electrolyte itself does not freeze until around -40°.
In fact, storing lithium batteries at 0°C prolongs their life compared to when you store them at higher temperatures. Some owners of Li-Ion batteries even claim to &quot;revive&quot; dead cells by placing them in a freezer for a week or so.
The one thing you should be really careful about when storing batteries at low temperatures is the possibility of moisture condensation on the battery's terminals when you bring the cold battery into a warm room afterwards or simply if the weather changes. This can cause a short circuit, which, while unlikely to damage the battery (as the water will likely evaporate from the current before anything truly bad happens), it is still unsafe and will corrode the battery's contacts through electrolysis.
So if you decide to store your batteries in the cold, and especially outside, put them in a sealed bag together with a baggy of desiccant (e.g. silica gel) so that the air around the battery is always as dry as possible, and when bringing them inside, _do not remove them from the bag until they'_ve warmed up to the ambient temperature.
However, if you try charging a lithium battery at a below-zero temperature, the battery will be rapidly and permanently damaged via the same lithium plating process that damages cells whose voltage is brought too low. The rate of damage is proportional to the charging current (i.e. more current damages your batteries faster), and the extent of it is such that manufacturers state that the battery is completely dead and should be disposed of if it's charged below zero even once.
The allowable charging temperature for lithium batteries is 0-45°C, but I'd recommend sticking to the middle of the range and only charging at room temperature.
Please note that the exact numbers (i.e. rated temperatures) are for Li-Ion cells, but they should be close for the whole lithium rechargeable family.

"My conclusion is yes, the FAA regulations do not directly apply. However ICAO takes over and the FAA is in charge of enforcing ICAO rules. Thus, while you can fly without FAA jurisdiction, High Seas Airspace is not a Wild West where anything goes.

The FAA remains in charge of all US civil aircraft even in High Seas Airspace:

Sec. 91.703 - Operations of civil aircraft of U.S. registry outside of the United States.
Each person operating a civil aircraft of U.S. registry outside of the United States shall--
(1) When over the high seas, comply with annex 2 (Rules of the Air) to the Convention on International Civil Aviation and with Secs. 91.117(c), 91.127, 91.129, and 91.131;

Note that all US drones are required to be registered with the US, so they would fall under this clause.
The upshot is that ICAO regulations are in force in international waters. A circular can be found here: https://www.icao.int/Meetings/UAS/Documents/Circular%20328_en.pdf. It describes required BVLOS navigation aids.

RADIO NAVIGATION AIDS AND AIRBORNE NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT
6.26 As a general statement, all aircraft, whether manned or unmanned, must meet the navigation performance requirements for the specific airspace in which they will operate.
6.27 RPA that utilize VLOS as the basis for navigation would not require an on-board means for determining position or the ability to fly an instrument approach. Operations of these aircraft are usually conducted under VMC to ensure the remote pilot can maintain continuous and direct visual observation of the RPA and its surrounding environment.
6.28 RPA that traverse several airspace volumes may operate for the most part under IFR. Such RPA will have to meet the communications, navigation, and surveillance requirements and have an appropriate aircraft operational certification associated with the airspace.
6.29 In cases where small RPA have a requirement to fly beyond VLOS, they will need a means to meet navigation capabilities for the airspace within which they are operating. This could involve an alternate means of achieving the navigation performance.

In addition,

LICENSING AND TRAINING FOR PILOTS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE REMOTE CREW
7.8 Remote pilots and other members of the remote crew shall be trained and licensed in accordance with Annex 1.
7.9 Licensing and training requirements will be developed similar to those for manned aviation and will include both the aeronautical knowledge and operational components. Specific adjustments may be needed considering the particular and unique nature and characteristics of the remote pilot station environment and RPA applications (from both a technical and flight operations perspective, e.g. VLOS or beyond VLOS) as well as aircraft type (e.g. aeroplane, helicopter). In that context, qualifications for certain categories of remote crew (e.g. VLOS helicopter) may be  significantly different from those pertaining to the traditional qualifications pertaining to manned aviation.
7.10 On the basis of the foregoing, current and previous notional designations for personnel piloting RPA will need to be replaced with applicable terms as contained in Annex 1, appropriately modified to indicate their position being external to the aircraft, such as “remote pilot”, “remote navigator” and/or “remote engineer”, each of which is a member of the remote crew. A new crew position unique to some VLOS operations is “RPA observer”, an individual who, by visual observation of the RPA, assists the remote pilot in the safe conduct of the flight. Additional crew positions unique  to remote pilot station/RPA operations may be identified over time. These new positions will need to be incorporated into Annex 1 for international standardization.

"The way the PID controller works is whenever the actual rate of rotation of the quadcopter does not equal the setpoint, or desired rate of rotation (which you set by moving the sticks), it sends a signal to the motors to compensate and bring the rate closer to the setpoint.

This signal is a sum of four terms: The P, I, D and FF. Since it's a sum, you can think of them as each pushing the quad in a certain direction independently, some terms adding up and others counteracting each other.

The P term is the difference between the setpoint and actual rate, multiplied by the P gain. So the amount of force applied by the P term is directly proportional to that difference. You can think of it as a spring that tries to move the quad back whenever it's bumped out of position. The further it's moved (bigger difference between setpoint and actual rate) and the stiffer the spring (bigger P gain), the stronger it will pull.

The reason why the FF term is needed is because the signal that the PID controller outputs influences the acceleration, not the speed directly. This means that the quad will not get up to speed immediately, but take some time depending on how hard it pushes itself. So when you want to sharply begin a maneuver you want the quad to apply a lot of force in that direction to get going and then sustain the rotation with a smaller force. 

The PID controller, however, is meant for stabilizing. It does not distinguish between you bumping the stick and the quad being bumped out of position by an obstacle or gust of wind. So when you move the stick it ""stabilizes"" itself at the new speed as if you didn't move the stick at all and it was bumped by something instead. You can think of moving the stick as moving the other end of the spring that the quad is attached to. The spring doesn't care which end was moved, just that its length changed.
This means that the PID controller won't apply as much force to start the rotation as it potentially could, which means it is somewhat slow to speed up when you move the stick, and, more importantly, slower to slow down when you move the stick back to center (and can even overshoot).

You can make the reaction faster by increasing the P gain, but to a point, as higher P gains lead to oscillations, when the quad's movements lead to big P terms which in turn cause bigger movements and so on.

So instead the FF term was added. The FF term does not consider the current rotation rate at all, so it does not contribute to the PID loop's stabilizing action and is thus unable to cause oscillations. The only thing that it looks at is the sticks. The force applied by the FF term is proportional to the rate at which you move your stick (multiplied by the FF gain). 
So when you, for example, initiate a roll and bump the stick to the right, the FF term will detect the fast stick movement and give a burst of force to get the quad going. Then, when you finish the roll and return your stick back to center, the FF term will detect the opposite fast stick movement and apply a corresponding force, helping the PID controller stop the quad's rotation faster and avoid overshooting.

"LiHV and LiPo batteries have different battery chemistry. If you were to charge a normal LiPo up to 4.35v per cell it would likely explode or at least puff up. The different battery chemistry in LiHV batteries allows the batteries to have a higher capacity to weight ratio. (For example, a 1500mah LiPo would be noticeably heavier than a 1500mah LiHV) A LiHV battery can hold more power and performance in a battery that weighs less. 

This ability to pack more power into the battery does come at a cost though as it does reduce the longevity of the battery significantly. Any good quality standard Lipo should hold up to 300+ charge cycles (If taken care of properly) whereas a LiHV battery may begin to swell up at only 30-40 cycles. 

LiHV batteries are very useful when it comes to serious racing though. The high performance and increased power per weight ratio give racers an advantage when racing, they will just need to replace batteries a lot more often.

"When choosing an FPV camera, there are several things that you need to look out for:
Sensor Technology
Most modern FPV cameras use a CMOS sensor. These are digital sensors that generally tend to have a higher resolution (measured in TVL or TeleVision Lines) than the alternative, which is CCD analogue sensors.
Pretty much every modern FPV camera uses CMOS tech, however, there are pros and cons to each:
CMOS positives:

They are generally higher resolution
They are very common so finding support should be easy

CMOS negatives:

They can introduce a shimmering effect in the image, especially around the edges of objects or in places of high contrast. Some people dislike this effect so strongly that they won't even consider CMOS cameras.

CCD positives:

They are less prone to jello, or warping of the image due to vibrations
They can have better dynamic range, although modern CMOS cameras tend to surpass CCD in this
They tend to create a &quot;softer&quot; image that is more pleasing to the eye, without any &quot;digital&quot; shimmer.

CCD negatives:

They are more expensive to make
They may have slightly higher latency
Very few new CCD cameras are being made, so there is less to choose from.

There are many more pros and cons, so I recommend reading the source of this pros and cons list.
Sensor size
The sensors used in FPV cameras can have different physical sizes.
Bigger sensor sizes perform better optically by capturing more light, so cameras with larger sensors are generally considered to produce a better image, but are also more expensive.
Format
There are two formats in our FPV cameras: NTSC and PAL. To know which camera you should get, make sure you check what format your goggles can use. Most modern cameras can be switched between NTSC and PAL, so
this isn’t too much of a big deal, but make sure you can check.
Size
Make sure you pick a camera that is an appropriate size for your drone.
The size classes commonly used today, defined by the camera enclosure's width, are Mini (22mm), Micro (19mm) and Nano (14mm). (The &quot;full&quot; size was 28mm).
Adapter brackets are available for mounting smaller cameras in frames with larger camera mounts, but there's nothing that would help you to fit a camera that's too wide for your frame.
For example, a CADDX Ratel which is 19x19mm would not be appropriate for a standard Tiny Whoop.
Aspect Ratio
Most modern FPV cameras will also have switchable 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios. Check which your goggles is designed for and which you personally prefer, though if you get a switchable one this likely isn’t a big deal.
Lens
The lens on your camera will affect the field of view. In general, a shorter lens will give a wider field of view (source). According to the same article, a wider lens can give better image quality.
Weight
If you’re going for an ultra-light build, every gram counts, and some cameras will be lighter than others. If this matters to you, be sure to check out the camera’s weight.
Software and other intangibles
There is more to a camera's performance than just the optics. The software that the camera uses to &quot;prettify&quot; the image is no less important, and can make or break the flying experience. Camera manufacturers each have their own WDR, sharpening, denoise, auto-exposure and other algorithms in their cameras, that all affect the picture. There are also some manufacturer-specific bugs in this software, which you may or may not care about. All of that can only be felt by looking at the actual imagery, which brings us to...
Personal Preference
This is the most important section. There are many videos and reviews online that let you see the actual image produced by the camera. Watch them and see for yourself.

"There are several things going on here. They can be broken down into three components.


Torque lever arm
Angular Velocity and Acceleration
Moment of Inertia


Torque Lever Arm

Essentially the distance on the axis is directly proportional to the torque lever arm. This means that in order to counteract outside influences on the system, the motor has to exert less force to stabilize the system. 



Angular Velocity

Also as a result of the increased distance from the center of rotation, a given velocity of the motor produces a lower rate of rotation due to the increased angular distance needed to travel. The motor has a fixed linear velocity for a given RPMs that is defined by the torque production of the motor, the velocity constant, and the pitch of the prop. Effectively this means that the longer the lever arm, the slower the rotation rate for a given linear velocity of the motor.  



Keep in mind angular velocity and linear velocity are directly proportional since motor velocity is a constant defined by the motor and prop combination, not impacted by radius. As a result, angular velocity is inversely proportional to radius (w = v / r). 

This is not necessarily the case for acceleration however. One might be tempted to think that because:

Fr = Ia (Force x radius = moment of inertia x angular acceleration) 

that the angular acceleration might also be equal because the r and I components of this equation cancel each other out by definition. The moment of inertia increase cancels out the torque increase due to distance in this equation as written. This results in net neutral equation given that r is changing equally on both sides of the equation.

F * r = m*r^2*a
m * dv/dt * r = m * r^2 * dw/dt
m * dv/dt * r = m * r * r * (dv/r)/dt
m * dv/dt * r = m * r * dv/dt


This is an oversimplification however, since we're not dealing with a point moment system defined by this equation. The motors make up only a small portion of the total distributed mass and resulting total moment of inertia. Since the distributed distances on the right do not equal the point force distance on the left side of the equation, as the radius at the point of force increases the rate at which the motors achieve the defined angular velocity speeds up. Essentially their effect against the system-wide moment of inertia is greater. This results in an interesting combination of a more stable system due to both lower sustained velocity at equivalent stick deflection and faster initial rates of change.  Because of the very fast rate of change the motors are already capable of producing, the constant angular velocity matters more to control rates for the pilot, while the angular acceleration matters more to the PID controller and resulting stability, so this combination is particularly effective. Going to a longer lever arm on an axis ""calms down "" that axis.

For more details check out this lesson on angular velocity and this lesson on angular acceleration over at Lumen Learning

One major consideration, particularly in racing and freestyle quads is that the accleration component happens so quickly (in the 100ms range) that it doesn't play a major role in the pilot control of the craft. The acceleration factor primarily impacts tuning and the PID authority. If you look at flight logs of a stretch X quad you'll see the that the stretched axis the motors are running at a higher percentage to achieve the equivalent rotational rate to non-stretched axis (assuming the flight controller rates are set equal on both). If you were to adjust the FC rates so the motor output was equal on both axes, the stretched axis would rotate at a slower rate than the non-stretched axis. The rate systems generally equalize this, but there are still changes in the system that impact the effective resolution on the stretched axis vs the non-stretched. The end result is that the stretched axis feels less jumpy with finer control than the the non-stretched axis. Basically it has greater control authority with more effective steps of motor throttle resolution per degree of rotation.

Moment of Inertia

Moment of inertia also plays a second less obvious role. On most quads, the mass distribution from pitch axis is actually greater than the roll axis. The camera and battery are typically arranged so that their maximum distance from the center of rotation is greater on the pitch axis than the roll axis. This is especially true on freestyle quads with a top mounted battery. This is less true, but still true to a certain extent on race quads with bottom mount batteries. Essentially what this means is that assuming zero outside forces, the pitch axis is already going to react slower to to forces attempting to change the angular velocity than the roll axis, even with an exactly symmetrical frame.

Conclusions

The combination of these factors brings us to the crux of why frames may choose stretch or wide configurations.

Stretch X

Race frame prefer the stretch X configuration. This is increasing the effective control on the pitch axis.  Remember because quads don't have vectored thrust (the thrust is always normal to the plane of the motors) They have to tip forward to gain speed. 



Effectively this means that very small changes in pitch create large changes in altitude as the vertical component of thrust changes. The larger the forward angle, the larger the horizontal component of thrust, the more altitude is gained/lost per degree of rotation. This makes a more stable and less ""twitchy"" pitch axis a very attractive proposition for a race quad where fine control of altitude is critical. Also keep in mind roll and yaw are largely inverted when traveling at high speed amd the resulting high forward angles, and having a proportionally higher sustained rotation rate on the roll axis becomes important as well. Tracking in corners will feel more direct, and pitch will feel more stable.

Wide X

Freestyle frames prefer a wider roll axis. Essentially the wider roll axis and resulting increase in effective resolution is compensating for the moment of inertia on the pitch axis, giving finer control on the roll axis and giving a more similar feeling to pitch. You end up with a much more equal type of control on roll and pitch, which is important to freestyle pilots who are more about doing tricks and ballistic maneuvers that rely on symmetrical control on roll and pitch. 

Also it's worth noting that a major reason for the wide X configuration on freestyle quads is keeping the props out of the view of the HD footage. I believe the this was the original reason, and the control gains were merely a happy accident.
",What is the advantage of a stretched-X frame over a true-X or squished-X design for racing?,"Most racing frames on the market appear to be stretched-X (longer than they are wide). 

I have heard the argument that a stretched-X allows better airflow to the rear props due to physical distance, but in a racing environment, the quads are usually flying at a much steeper pitch angle than any other form of flying which should give the rear props much cleaner air.

In my experience flying line of sight, stretched-X frames seem to have more pitch authority than roll which would seem to be the opposite of what would be desirable in a racer.

Other than the fact that they are a little narrower so they fit through the gates better, can anyone offer any advice as to why stretched-X frames are so popular?

"Throttle scaling is not training wheels so don't feel back about using it.  It's never fun to fly a quad with a throttle that is too touchy.  

Another option is throttle expo which you can turn on in the rates area of Betaflight.  Find the hover point for the quad and set that to be the center of your throttle curve. Then add some expo to soften the rate and give you some more resolution at the hover point.  

Also keep in mind that with a 3"" inch size, matching your motor kV and battery cell counts are very important. If your motors are up at 6000kv area you probably want to stay with 3s batteries.

"There has been a good deal of discussion on this topic, and it has been no small source of conflict between several of the main firmware players in the high-performance DIY drone flight controller world.  The short version is that based on evidence gathered from flight recorder logs, the ICM series gyros are more sensitive to electrical and mechanical noise than the MPU6000 gyro.  

One of the major issues is that the MPU6000 is considered NR/ND (Not recommended for new designs) since 2017-ish, and there is some question as to how much longer it will be available.  This makes manufacturers hesitant about using it in new designs.

The core of the argument around the ICM gyro has to do with the DLPF bypass mode that enables 32 Khz read rates (see section 9.17 in the datasheet for the ICM 20602). There is one school of thought that this mode simply gives lower-level access to the same data that is used by the internal DLPF to create the 8 Khz data output, and external software filters can do a better job than the internal DLPF used to create the hardware-given 8 Khz data.  There seems to be a good deal of support however that this is not the case. It appears that moving the gyro into 32 Khz read mode actually reduces the fundamental accuracy of the readings being taken. Mark Spatz has done a good deal of work logging and analyzing data recordings from multiple gyros with the conclusion that 32 Khz in experimental mode is producing data that is both different and dramatically less accurate than when not in experimental mode, though why disabling the internal DLPF would have this impact still remains a question.

Even taking this into account, the ICM series gyros can perform essentially as well as the MPU600 when care is taken. Many of the issues seen with the ICM gyros result from poorly executed filtering on the 3.3v power supply. See this research article for an exploration of why this is a problem. Essentially if the power supply lines can be kept clean, and the internal DLPF is kept on, the gyro seems to perform decently. 

All that being said, having been involved in support in the drone industry for a while though, my personal experience has been that flight controllers that use the ICM gyro have a higher failure rate and a higher chance of having issues than flight controllers with the MPU6000. I have a shelf full of flight controllers I pulled due to ICMs that became too sensitive to tune, and much larger number of folks I've helped debug with the same issue, but I've not had that issue with MPU6000. While this is purely anecdotal, it aligns with the experience of enough pilots that it has become a common thought in the DIY drone hobby, hence the reason why this question even came up.

"The more open the air-intake area you have, the more efficient the drone will be. For example, something as fine as mosquito netting will likely cause the drone to be less efficient and less agile while something with larger holes and more open areas won't impact it as much.

"There are several factors that are important for what FPV goggles are right for you:
Type
The first thing you’ll notice is that there are two main types of FPV goggles: slimline and box.
Slimline goggles are usually more expensive, but they are also lighter and many people find them to be more comfortable. Their screens are also smaller, which means that getting good resolution makes the displays more expensive. There are two screens in this type of goggle, which means that some goggles (for example the Skyzone Sky02X) can support 3D video if you have the required camera and VTX hardware.
Box goggles, on the other hand, are larger and have a larger, single screen. This means that some people find these goggles less comfortable, but this brings the advantage that some goggles can fit a set of glasses inside.
Screens
There are different types of screens used in goggles. OLED is generally favoured as looking better with deeper colours, but LCD is usually cheaper.
Receiver
Many goggles have receivers built-in, and some don’t. There are also different kinds of receivers.
When looking for goggles, you really want a ‘diversity’ receiver. This means that the goggles receive two video signals and either pick the strongest or merge the signals to create a stronger one. This means you can add an omni and patch antenna, two patch antennae or two omni antennae.
Most goggles will have a receiver built-in, but the more expensive goggles, such as Fatshark HDO2 and Orqa's FPV.one, don’t come with a receiver, which means you need to buy your own. This gives you more choice to pick a receiver that best serves your needs, for example adding a Rapidfire module which is widely regarded as one of the best receiver modules out there at the time of writing.
IPD and Diopter settings
Most slimline goggles will have an adjustable inter-pupillary distance. When picking your goggles, make sure that the IPD is suitable for your face.
If you have glasses, it is also useful to make sure your goggles either have adjustable diopters (for example the Fatshark HDO2) or can take diopter inserts (for example the SkyZone Sky02X).
Battery input
There are three ways that people commonly power their goggles.
The first of these is a built-in battery that you charge through USB. Counterintuitively, it is usually the cheaper goggles that have a built-in battery, as this means that it is either more difficult to replace the battery, or you can’t bring spare batteries with to fly for longer.
The next kind is a Li-ion pack. These generally take 18650 Li-ion cells and are held in the head strap. These usually have larger capacities than the third type of batteries: LiPo.
Many people use LiPos to power their goggles, either through a specialised battery to hold in the head strap, or with a cable to a battery in the pocket. The latter of these has a distinct advantage: you can use your quad’s batteries (as long as your goggles support the voltage) and you can charge them on your balance charger.
Brand
I usually would say that brand loyalty shouldn’t play too much of a part, but when looking at goggles you want to buy from a brand that you know will offer technical support if you have a problem with your goggles. So I don’t introduce bias, I’m not going to say which brands I prefer.
Features
DVR is important in goggles, which is helpful to find your quad if it crashes.
Another ‘feature’ is a power button. It sounds odd, but many FatShark goggles don’t have a power button. If a power button is important to you. Make sure to look for that.
Another useful feature is a fan (mainly for slimline goggles) as this de-dogs the goggles during a long flying session.
Light-leak resistance is very important. If light gets into your goggles, this can break the immersion. Take a look at the reviews online to see what people think.
Screen Quality
Finally, before buying, take a look online to see if you actually like how the screens look. People such as Joshua Bardwell will actually put a GoPro in the goggles so you can see what they look like in real life.

"The first thing you should consider is what you have room for. A larger drone will normally need more space to fly and can cause more damage if crashed. I would recommend a small drone if you are just starting out or if you can only fly indoors, in which case you would want a tiny whoop.

The next thing I would think about is cost. A larger drone will be much more expensive for the drone itself, the propellers, the parts (frame, electronics, etc.), and especially batteries. While a larger drone may have slightly longer flight times, one battery for a large drone might cost 10 times as much as a battery for a small drone. So, with smaller drones, you can get more flight time per dollar of battery. (you can buy 4-6 small batteries for the price of one large battery and get a lot more flight time for the same amount of money). So, if you're on a budget, I definitely recommend a small drone. It's also worth mentioning that larger drones usually use batteries with more cells so they can be more dangerous if they catch on fire or puff up. 

Next, there is flight performance. Generally, it is true that a smaller drone is more nimble than a large drone, although Larger drones are usually capable of much higher top-speeds. I must say though, after having lots of experience with different drones I much prefer the performance of a large, powerful drone to a small drone because small drones often suffer from lots of battery sag due to the lower battery voltages and so they cannot sustain high throttle as well. Also, a larger drone can carry a GoPro or other camera with ease.

So in the end:


Get a small drone if: you only have a small area, you only have a little bit of money, you are very worried about damaging something, you want a lot of flight time for less money, or if you just don't want a big drone.
Get a larger drone if: You have enough space and money, you want high performance/top speed, you want something that can lift a GoPro/camera/payload, or if you just want a larger drone.

"Turtle Mode, Flip Over After Crash in Betaflight, is a mode that allows your drone to flip over if it is upside down by reversing the prop direction and spinning up very rapidly in order to lift a side of the drone so it flips to the upright position. 

This is a manual process - the drone doesn't do this automatically when it flips over (you need to enable turtle mode after the crash, manipulate the sticks to flip the drone over, and disable turtle mode in order to resume flight).  It's beneficial because if your drone goes down 100' away, for example, you can put your drone in turtle mode and flip it back to the normal position, and resume flying.

"I don't know about all the cameras, but here is my opinion.  

If you want the best video quality you can get today and not be too heavy for a 5"" FPV drone, then you want the GoPro Hero 8.  That will obviously change quickly if something better comes along.  The Hero 8 also has great stability with Hypersmooth or you can opt to use ReelSteady Go with it.  Downsides are the size, weight, form factor, and cost.

The benefit of the GoPro Hero 7 is that it is slightly lighter than the 8, has a removable lens, accepts ND filters better, and Hypersmooth is still quite good.  However, it does not work as well with ReelSteady Go.

The GoPro Session 5 was the go-to camera for FPV drones for years and lots of people still use it because of its size, weight, and form factor.  However, GoPro does not make them anymore so they are not as easy to get.

If you want stabilized HD footage for a drone that can't carry a GoPro, then consider using the Insta360 Go.  They are tiny, lightweight, and can thus be used on very small drones.

If you are not looking for the best quality, and the cost is more important, then consider some of the cheaper options like the Caddx camera.

I'd say the best way to choose a camera all depends on what your needs are, what you want out of it etc.  If you just want decent videos for Instagram, you will have a different answer than someone shooting cinematic footage for commercial use.

And one final bit, be sure to get some sort of protection plan on the camera because you will most likely kill it at some point.  If you can buy the camera from Best Buy, they offer a great Geek Squad protection plan.  Another option for the GoPro cameras is the GoPro plan.

"There's no denying the fact that when it comes to materials that are strong, stiff and light at the same time, carbon fiber is king. If you're looking for performance, there's no way around it. If performance is not the most important thing in the world, however... Well, there are several options.
Before I start listing these, I must point out that all frames break. Some break more easily than others, but you can't have an unbreakable frame. The question is how you repair it when it breaks, and the answer depends on the material.

Plastic frames are actually a very popular option in micro-sized quadcopters that only weigh tens of grams. These frames usually feature a non-flat shape, prop guards and other features built into them. A subset of those, 3D printed frames, are also quite widely used in DIY designs of larger sizes, and, as everything 3D printed, are a good way of prototyping your design before moving on to other materials. In some cases, where performance is not a concern (for example, if your main focus is having a platform for testing algorithms for which flight time or range is not important at the time, or just want to play around with a design) you may even never move on from a 3D printed frame. While these tend to be heavy and/or brittle compared to other materials, there are some exceptionally light designs, and depending on the intended applications, durability might not be a concern. Besides, if you do break one of these, you can always just print a new one.
Also keep in mind that there are many different specialized 3D plastics available, such as carbon-impregnated ones, lightweight foaming PLA and others, which, along with clever design, can in fact give you a fairly performant, stiff and/or light frame. All of these have tradeoffs, however, so do your research.
Wood and metal/fiberglass is a staple of &quot;oldschool&quot;, large (8&quot;+) DIY drones from the KK2/Naze era. As the drone gets larger, heavier frames tend to impede it less, and any crash could easily break an arm just due to the sheer weight of the drone, no matter what the arm is made of. So this kind of design focuses on repairability instead: one can easily make tens of wooden arms in their workshop for very cheap and swap them when they break. Potentially, one could try to make a smaller wooden frame as well, although at this point lightness becomes important, so I'd advise to stick to lighter woods if you do, maybe even balsa.

Full-metal frames are not unheard of as well; Aluminium and titanium are widely-accepted building materials in aviation and actually tend to have better performance than wood. You'll have to use tubes/other non-flat shapes, though.
Even though you've ruled out carbon fiber, you may be referring specifically to CNC machining of frames out of flat sheets. Premade carbon fiber elements such as strips and tubing are readily available for order online and are easy to work with using basic tools. A lot of larger drones today are made using the same basic technologies as the wood/metal drones of old, but with arms out of carbon fiber tubes instead of wooden planks. If you're building a large drone, this is a very feasible yet high-performance option.


Finally, Pure fiberglass composite. Glass fiber composites are in fact even stronger per unit weight than their carbon fiber counterparts, but significantly less stiff, which is why you don't usually see them in performance drones: In flight, dynamic and resonant characteristics are more significant than pure strength, the latter coming into play only when you crash. But if the drone flies better, you're less likely to crash in the first place. Still, the difference in stiffness of the material can be overcome with clever profiles, and glass is generally easier to work with than carbon, so there are some niche uses even in performance designs.

The first of them is very large drones, which tend not to care as much about neither weight nor aerobatic performance. Here, glass fiber can shine if you've got the facilities to manufacture it. That said, if you're building a very large drone, the frame is likely to be a very small fraction of its cost, so you might just as well order a custom carbon design (or use premade carbon parts like the previous option).
The more interesting option, however, is a PCB frame, in which the frame is
not just a structural component, but also carries all the electronics
that the drone needs to fly. Some fantastically lightweight designs
have been made using this technique: even though the glass fiber
itself does not perform as well as carbon, the design makes up for it by ditching
all the other PCB and wiring weight that would otherwise be carried
on top of the frame in a traditional design. While not optimal for sporty flying, this is the perfect option for a long-range/long
flight time autonomous design... if you can lay out the PCB, as all
of the components (flight controller, ESCs, vTX, etc) have to be
integrated into it.

"This is a setting that is needed for RPM sensing and RPM filtering. An ESC can not sense the RPM of your motors directly, but can sense how often the magnets in the motor bell pass by the coils in its stator (this is called eRPM), and will report that number to the flight controller if you've got bidirectional DSHOT enabled. If your motor bell has x magnets (or poles) in it, then they will pass a coil x times per full revolution of the bell. Thus, 
    eRPM = x * RPM. 

In other words, to calculate the RPM of a motor, the flight controller will read the eRPM value reported by the corresponding ESC, and divide it by the number of poles. This means that if you set the wrong number of poles, your flight controller will read the wrong RPM from the motors, and the RPM filter will not work properly.

If you don't use RPM filtering, you probably should not care. If you do, it won't work as intended (and may cause your copter to fly worse) unless you put in the correct number.

"To my knowledge, the most readily available consumer long-range RC control system is the Crossfire ecosystem from Team BlackSheep. It makes use of the 868 MHz/915 MHz band and supports RF transmission powers from 10 mW to 2000 mW.



Under good conditions and given well thought out antenna orientations, TBS Crossfire can achieve some truly ludicrous ranges for RC gear in the neighborhood of several kilometers. It's decently expensive and works best with RC transmitters running the OpenTX firmware, but is considered the best in the business for consumer RC.

FPV video systems are far more limited in terms of range capabilities, no matter whether or not you chose an analog or a digital system (e.g. DJI, FatShark Bytefrost). These systems most often use the 5.8 GHz band and thus have range capabilities which severely limit the long-range capabilities of most RC control links. The community doesn't have terribly good solutions for long-distance FPV video transmission.

"There are two possibilities, depending on how ducts increase efficiency, but the end result should be the same. It could reduce torque required to spin the motor at a given RPM and thrust, or it could increase the thrust per RPM of the propeller with a constant torque. In either case the torque required to spin the propeller for hover thrust goes down.

For the given hover thrust the yaw torque caused by propeller drag as described above would then go down. The yaw torque produced by the inertia of the propeller and motor changing speed would remain constant (assuming the moment of inertia of that system is the same).

I'm not sure what the ratio of yaw torque generated by propeller drag is to the yaw torque generated by accelerating the propeller, but the inertia based one would eventually saturate like a reaction wheel on a space craft does.

This means that your maximum yaw steady state angular acceleration would go down if weight of the aircraft was exactly equal. I'm not sure how often multirotors get to this point. For smaller movements my intuition says that it would come down to flight controller tuning to get similar yaw performance.
",What impact does a shroud have on the torque produced by the prop(s) of a multirotor that incorporates a properly designed shouded propeller?,"Based on the research presented here: ""Hover and wind-tunnel testing of shrouded rotors for improved micro air vehicle design"" and other reading that translates similarly well-designed shroud and rotor combinations into more general layman's terms, I have found that some authors indicate that there is a performance increase of 40% to 60% in static thrust for such a configuration. One source has indicated a theoretical increase in static thrust as much as 80%.

If we focus our attention on a multirotor design that is intended as a craft whose principal purpose is for inspections of stationary objects such as buildings and stationary infrastructure, and it is not expected to fly fast nor fly far, then the primary benefit from the shrouded rotor is the improvement of static thrust. Flight in translation will be rare and incidental to maneuvering around the object being inspected.

And assuming that the shroud can be manufactured with a mass that is less that the incremental improvement in thrust, this design will serve its intended purpose with the significant benefit of having some built-in protection from horizontal impact with obstacles.

The need for maneuverability will be equal to most other multirotor applications intended for inspections and as such yaw will still need to be produced by controlling the speed of the propellers by the flight controller.

What impact will the shroud have on the production of yaw by the torque produced by the propellers (rotors)?

"Thrust is proportional to the change in momentum of the air passing through the prop - i.e. how much the prop speeds it up. 

The power required to do this is proportional to the kinetic energy of the air, which is proportional to speed squared. That 'squared' is the problem.

A smaller prop acts on less air, so it has to speed it up more to generate the same thrust. Half as much air moving twice as fast generates the same thrust, but takes twice as much power.

This explains why helicopters can hover relatively economically, propeller planes only if they're powerful aerobatic models, jets only if they're extremely powerful and carrying a minimum of weight, and no one uses rockets unless they have to.

"I think prop wash is not entirely eliminable by tuning. If you have really good gear and tune you may be able to reduce it even further, but it will be there.

When you are doing sharp turns, you are flying into your own turbulent air stream and the effectivity of your motors compared to each other changes unpredictably and rapidly. The flight controller tries to compensate, but neither the calculation nor the the motors' reaction is instantaneous, so most probably the compensation will come too late and will not achieve the required effect, which will trigger further and further micro adjustments until the quad reaches more predictable air.

So the easiest way to eliminate prop wash is to move out of your own turbulent air as quickly as possible. When doing split-S don't just descend vertically, but start moving forward before arresting your fall so your motors will be over clean air.
",Tuning sharp turn prop wash,"When I do a split-S or make a sharp turn around an object, my drone shakes due to the prop wash.

"TLDR;
Aft CG means stalls are unrecoverable!
Why is CG relevant?
The plane's elevator is the control surface for pitch angle. The elevator is its own proper wing, and as such only has a certain amount of force it can develop before it stalls. Once it stalls, then pitch control is lost. Not a happy day.
The force that the elevator must develop is the lever arm required to balance the torque stemming from the distance between the airframes center of gravity (CG) and the wing's aerodynamic center.

Think about it as a see-saw with an elephant sitting close to the center, being balanced by a mouse 100x farther out.
The upshot is that if the CG is aft of the aerodynamic center, then the plane's nose naturally wants to rotate up, and the elevator has to push the tail up to counterbalance.
And if the CG is fore of the aerodynamic center, then the plane's nose naturally wants to rotate down, and the elevator has to push the tail down to counterbalance.
Aft CG
Aft CG is a huge no-no. It all comes down to stall recovery. If the CG is behind the aerodynamic center, then if the plane stalls the nose will simply not come down. The upshot is that you can never regain airspeed and you will enter into what's called a deep stall or leaf stall.
One common reason for cargo aircraft crashes is improperly secured loads which shift backwards immediately after rotation on takeoff. This moves the CG aft, and the plane can no longer keep its nose down and very quickly stalls unrecoverably. There is a famous video a decade years back of a US military cargo jet which had its cargo load shift back on takeoff while departing a Middle East airbase. All aboard died, and I won't post the link out of sensitivity.
Excessive forward CG
If it's too far forward then your elevator will have to produce a ton of downward force to keep the nose up. This is draggy and inefficient. But it's also (within the limits of reason) survivable.
So where to put the CG?
As far back as you safely can! Competition glider pilots move the CG to the very limits of safety because they want to stop the elevator from producing downward thrust which costs precious meters of altitude.
Jetliners want an aft CG because it saves fuel. But don't panic, they have strict limits on how far back they can move it. Because in equal parts no pilot wants to die and no amount of saved jet fuel ever covers the cost of a crashed plane.

"AFAIK servos are usually driven by a PWM signal (which the Graupner RX seems to put out as well) with usually 50Hz. So you could basically check if the RX is putting out PWM signals on the 7 outputs. Just connect your scope to one ground pin as well as one data pin. Then you should see a square wave on the scope. If the square wave has a duty cycle of 1000µs, it means 0° (so the left most position of the servo). 2000µs means that the servo is supposed to rotate to the right most position, usually 180°.

There are some exceptions with some servos (continuously rotating servos - similar to stepper motors, or some servos have more than 180° of rotation), they probably don't affect you though.

If you are unsure about the waveforms or something else, I'm happy to help. I wouldn't say that the tiny movement of the servo you described means anything. It's probably just the servo ""snapping"" into it's position after getting power or something to help the servo to find out its current position.

"My experience is that motor cooling does change enormously depending on how they are installed, but not three orders of magnitude.

My Funfighter motor initially got hot enough that a drop of water would sizzle off the outside, yet when flown without the cowl it could be merely warm at the end of a flight. Similarly I have a helicopter where the standard motor was too hot to touch at the end of a flight but a replacement with a built-in fan stayed cool. I've also noticed that you can put 100W through a 2204 sized motor on a pylon racer but not on a 3D model that prop-hangs a lot.

It's also worth considering that our flights are fairly short. Using a heat capacity of 0.4 J/g-C as an average of copper and iron, a 50g, 100W, 80% efficient motor would heat up 20*0.4/50 = 0.16 degrees C per second, or 10 degrees per minute. Even with no cooling, that would only raise the motor from cold to warm in a 3-4 minute flight. It's not ""excruciatingly hot"" because it has so much more mass than a light bulb and takes longer to heat up.

I guess this variability is bad news for anyone trying to estimate how much cooling their motor will experience, but it's good news for your average modeller who can just improve the airflow over an over-heating motor to fix the problem.

FWIW my rule of thumb for fixed wings is 50W for a 2204 motor, 100W for a 2208, 150 for a 2212 (based on the stator size, not HobbyKing's overall size numbers).

For quads, the peak power can be a lot higher because you only use it for short periods but the average power over the whole flight should be similar. 4s1500mAh battery over 5 minutes is 200W, or 50W per motor - just right for 2204 motors.
",Modeling heat build-up in air-cooled outrunners,"I'm creating a thermal model for heat build-up in my outrunner motors. So far, I haven't found any online resources that discuss this. Here is the basic equations for forced convective transfer:

Q = h * A * delT, where Q is the heat transferred, A is the exposed area, delT is the temperature differential, and h is the heat transfer coefficient.

For forced air, h ranges from 1 to 1000, so it's easy to see why the devil is in this detail. A three-order of magnitude difference in cooling efficiency is huge, to put it mildly. Typical published values for forced convection are in the 10-100 range, but those seem ludicrously low for the amount of heat that a typical multirotor motor needs to shed.[*]

There are ways to calculate h from Reynolds and Prandtl relations, but without extensive modeling those are exceedingly hard to get in the turbulent flow regime around a spinning motor.

Although this particular application is a fixed-wing with a cowled motor, the basics still apply and only the airstream speed and volume changes.

Can anyone shed any insight?



[*] If you have a 100W motor that's 80% efficient, that's 20W of heat energy. To put things in perspective, it's like a 20W incandescent bulb, only much smaller. So if the heat weren't being dumped very quickly into the airstream, the motor would get excruciatingly hot.

"When looking for a battery, there are a number of factors to consider: the voltage (or S rating), the capacity, the C rating, the type of connector, and the weight:
Voltage
You will often see batteries having an ‘S’ rating on them, for example 6S or 4S. This is the number of cells, which directly impacts the voltage output of the battery. Just to be clear, I am specifically talking about LiPo batteries here as nominal voltages vary between battery chemistries.
Each cell will add a maximum voltage of 4.2V, and a nominal voltage of 3.7V to the battery, so to figure out the nominal voltage of a battery, just multiply the number of cells by 3.7, so a 3S battery has a nominal voltage of 11.1V and a maximum voltage of 12.6V. This is very important using a battery with too low an S rating will likely make the aircraft more sluggish, but using a battery with too many cells is likely to make the aircraft more on fire.
You may see batteries written in the format 4S1P or similar. This means that there are 4 cells in series that are treated as one parallel cell - i.e that there are no other parallel cells.
Capacity
The capacity of a battery is measured in mAh, or milli Amp-hours. This is the number of milliamperes the battery can output at the nominal voltage if the battery is discharged over the course of one hour. For example, a 1300mAh 4S battery could output 1.3A at 14.8V for one hour.
In general, a greater capacity will mean more flight time, however there are caveats, an important one being the battery’s weight (which I will talk about later).
C Rating
The C rating is the maximum discharge rating, and it acts as a multiplier of the capacity. For example, if I have a 1300mAh LiPo with a C rating of 100, the maximum current output will theoretically be 100*1.3=130A. Obviously, a higher theoretical discharge rate should give greater performance.
These metrics are very variable between brands, however. What Turnigy considers to be 100C may only be 75C for another brand, so there is in reality very little point comparing C ratings between brands.
C is also used when charging. You may have heard people say ‘charge at 1C’ or something similar, and this means the same thing. For example, charging a 1300mAh LiPo at 1C would be charging at 1.3A.
Connector Type
The way you get the power from your quad is also very important. There are many connectors currently in use, but here is a rundown of the most common used on a multicopter:

JST PH2.0: small white connectors most often used on Tiny Whoops, sometimes used in series on a toothpick.
BT2.0: small white connectors most often used on Tiny Whoops, sometimes used in series on a toothpick.
XT30: small yellow connectors, most often used on toothpicks and 2/3 inch quads.
XT60: medium-sized yellow connectors, pretty much the standard for 4-7 inch quads.
XT90: large yellow connectors, often used in parallel or series on larger Beast Class or X Class builds
Deans: not commonly used in multicopters, however many batteries you will see do have this style of connector, which often has burgundy plastic.

Weight
As mentioned before, more capacity usually brings more weight, which introduces the problem of balancing capacity and weight.
For example, a toothpick with a 5000mAh should be able to fly for an hour, but would in reality be unlikely to last a minute if it could even take off due to the large weight of the battery. Some people say that your battery should not make up more than a third of the weight of your drone, however, you can huddle this based on your motors’ thrust and your build’s weight.
Conclusion
There are many factors when choosing what battery to use for your drone, however, all of the above aspects are vital in ensuring good performance and longevity of your aircraft.

"As far as I know, it doesn’t make too much of a difference in regards to flight stability because of something called the Drone Pendulum Fallacy, which describes how the drone rotates about the centre of mass, not from the point at which the thrust is created as illustrated below in the photo from the Drone Pendulum Fallacy website:


In my experience, it may affect handling - many racing pilots prefer bottom mounted whilst many freestyle pilots prefer top mounted, however this is down to the way the quad handles and so is really personal preference.

There are other factors you may want to consider - for example a top mounted battery brings the centre of mass closer to the thrust line, and it can also balance out the impact of having a GoPro on your quad. A top mounted battery also means you don’t have to land on your battery so takes away that risk.

However, a top mounted battery requires more space than a bottom mounted one (assuming you also want to use a GoPro).

Oscar Liang talks about this on their website, so I recommend taking a look there to help make up your decision.

"They are more stable since the drone is suspended from a higher point.  If the drone tilts, the side that gets lowered has its propellers move outwards, giving them more leverage while the side that gets raised has its propellers move inwards, giving them less leverage.

"No, you do not require an Amateur licence to use this equipment.

Most RC equipment that operates at 5.8GHz (or 2.4GHz) makes use of what is known as an ISM band, a series of frequencies made available for anyone to use (historically for Industrial, Scientific and Medical purposes) subject to certain restrictions - such as transmitter power.

These restrictions have been set so that everyone gets fair use (rather than becoming an RF shouting match) and to minimise the harm caused if misused.

So long as the equipment complies with your local regulations for ISM equipment you are able to use it. The difficulty can be verifying this compliance without test equipment; reputable products will usually be correctly tested and constructed, whereas some inexpensive/unbranded clones might have cut corners to save money which means they are no longer legal.

"You can use layered approach. First, find a solution (for example using WiFi D2D) to build a mesh overlay layer using Wi-Fi links. This mesh-overlay will ensure that you have data communication from the base station to the drone over multiple relays.

Then, you can use ground control software and route the MAVLink packets over the above described mesh network. To do that, you will need to run software on a compute note in the drone, which will decapsulate MAVLink from IP traffic - for example mavlink-router - and forward them to the serial port. This serial port must be connected to the telemetry port on your flight controller.

The final step - in the ground control software just enter the IP address of your drone, and let the mesh-overlay take care of the data routing and connection maintenance.
",DIY wireless mesh network to extend drone&#39;s operational range,"I have stumbled upon this question regarding technology providing longest range for rc controls and would like to ask a related one. Theoretically it should be possible to build a wireless mesh network that can route the signal from the drone to the operator and back thus extending the operational range of the drone while relying on the same frequency(/power per unit).


is there an open-source project that implements such a mesh network in conjunction with an open-source flight control?
is it theoretically possible to build the nodes of such a mesh network using Arduino and power them with not too big solar panels?
would it be possible to transmit real time video through such a solar-powered mesh network?
how would such a network, of let's say 5 nodes, extend the operational range of currently available drones?

"I started out in this hobby almost exactly the same way, as a programmer who wanted to get into flight code for multicopters and autonomous planes. And while I've yet to launch a fully autonomous aircraft with my own code at the proverbial stick, within my year or so researching the topic hands-on, I have accumulated some useful knowledge which I'm going to share here.

First, you'll probably need to become intimately familiar with all the hardware that comprises a drone.

If you want to do anything seriously interesting with it, anyway.

There do exist some integrated programmable drones that abstract the hardware part away and let you code basic flight routes, but they're limited by that same abstraction to the most basic maneuvering. This, as many consumer drone owners can attest, is rather boring unless you have a specific application in mind. And specific applications (apart from filming/photography, which are usually automated enough in commercial camera drones out of the box anyway) usually require something more than just a drone with a camera.

Of course, you might be content with that. You might want to simply play with it in your living room or backyard, which is perfectly fine, and in this case a prefab proprietary drone like the Tello might suit you well, especially if you're only going to use it as a stepping stone/demo version before diving into the ""real thing"" (or not). As a disclaimer, I haven't researched this one in particular, but I'd bet it has all the characteristics of a proprietary product: highly refined, but also sealed, with its own API/ecosystem, and capable of some particular subset of possible flight modes that the developers thought safe/proper. Which is okay if you're using this as a tool for learning programming and/or general robotics, but this will slow one down once one starts to get into anything advanced. Besides, if you decide to move on from one of these to something else, you won't be able to take any of your code along: it will certainly be incompatible with anything not of that manufacturer.

The alternative is to roll your own: buy all the components either separately or as a kit and build a drone for yourself (or buy a prebuilt kit, which is very distinct from buying a commercially manufactured drone). This has all the characteristic advantages and drawbacks of open source: On the plus side, it's highly customizable and extendable, often has the most cutting edge tech, open standards, portability of code, etc. Most importantly for this application, it allows interoperability with about any kind of peripheral you can think of (provided that this peripheral can talk via one of the standard protocols, e.g. SPI/I²C/RS232/OneWire/etc, though you probably could hack in support for proprietary protocols as well if you really wanted). All of that is balanced by around zero customer support: No one's there to hold your hand, and any issues you might experience you'll have to troubleshoot on your own, maybe with the help of knowledgeable friends... or internet strangers like ourselves. Given that you're already a software engineer, you're probably doing it all the time anyway, however.

Second: There's only a few scriptable autopilots.

I'm going to cover the open source ones for the most part, as for the reasons outlined above I was never particularly interested in the proprietary variety. Also, I'm talking about high-level flight code, e.g. code that defines complex behavior on top of some other flight control software, which in turn provides at least basic stabilization and primitive maneuvering. If you want to dabble in low-level stabilization code that works directly with bare metal, you can just fork any flight control project or even write your own.

So, a rundown of all the options in order of increasing complexity:


Most flight control software has varying degrees of inbuilt flight behavior automation such as takeoff, landing, position hold/loiter, return to home, and waypoint missions.
The latter represents the most basic form of programming: you set up a flight route consisting of waypoints, possibly with other modes thrown in (e.g. takeoff, go to waypoint A, then B, loiter there for 10 minutes, go home, land). This mission is then uploaded to the drone and off it goes. This, as far as I know, does not support conditionals or other control structures, so is not turing-complete.
For more complex high-level flight control, there's a widely-supported protocol called MAVLink. It allows for a device external to the flight controller to query flight parameters and issue commands via a UART connection. This is the protocol that's usually used by ground station software (through which you define the waypoint missions mentioned above and otherwise remotely control your craft's behavior). 

MAVLink is supported by most flight control software suites, and is very bulletproof by the standards of this currently highly experimental field. The data and commands available via the protocol range from the highest inbuilt abstraction level (e.g. add waypoints or change flight modes and set their parameters) to almost the lowest (e.g. query exact attitude, read data from gyros or other peripherals, set rotation rates), and the set can be extended arbitrarily. The only caveat is that it's only a communication protocol/API, so you'll need some kind of external computing device, either onboard or remote, to provide the actual logic. 

This ""physically external logic"" approach is probably the most approachable option for a regular programmer, since you can run your flight code on your laptop in any language you like, controlling the craft remotely via a telemetry link (which is basically a pair of transponders, one of which plugs into USB and the other into the flight controller's UART, providing a bidirectional serial connection over radio). If you do so, mind the latency and link health: it might restrict you to higher-level control. If you find yourself needing more fine-grained control, you can move the code to an onboard computer (e.g. raspberry pi) connected to the flight controller directly, getting rid of the radio link and retaining the familiar Unix-y operating environment.

The MSP protocol mentioned in the other reply falls, as far as I can tell, into the same category, but is somewhat more specific. That's perfectly fine, though; use whatever works for you.
Finally, there's the option of onboard scripting, defined as user code that runs on the flight controller hardware together with (or, rather, on top of) the basic flight control software itself, and makes use of the latter's capabilities. This allows one to code custom flight logic without modifying the code of the autopilot itself, yet have both high-level control of the autopilot's automation features, and fine-grained low-level access to the craft's hardware with about the lowest possible latency. The approach comes with some operating restrictions, however, since you'll have to work within a real-time operating environment and with very limited resources. Also, there's only a small selection of autopilots which support such scripting, at least ones that I know of, and all of those are thanks to a question I asked earlier on this very site. Here's a summary of the contents:


Ardupilot supports onboard Lua scripting in its Copter/Rover variants since v4.0 and in Plane since v3.11. As of right now, this seems the most ""lightweight-yet-powerful"" option and thus most promising for my use case.
ROSflight has been suggested, which is an autopilot package running on top of the Robot Operating System, all of which is apparently highly modular and allows you to add (or replace) any part of the flight code independently. See the relevant answer for more details.
Finally, this comment by Kenn Sebesta: Tau Labs supports picoC and full flight scripting. It is very stable and the feature set is robust, but it's a bit abandonware at this point so you'd be on your own for support.
There might be more I don't know of, so may want to look around some more if you want onboard scripting.



Third: Your hardware choice will depend heavily on which of the above you choose.

The first (implicit) choice is the type of platform: plane, multicopter, boat, car, etc. Of which you seem to have already chosen the second, but I'm going to point out the existence of that choice anyway.

Then comes the flight control system's architecture as outlined above: Is it going to be just a single (scriptable) flight controller? An FC with a control link to a ground station? An FC/onboard general-purpose single board computer pairing? Something else? If you've got a specific application in mind, do you need any particular onboard peripherals/payload that need to be integrated into the control stack? 

With all of that in mind, you'll choose a combination of flight controller (hardware) and flight control package (firmware), plus possibly the aforementioned peripherals, secondary computer, radio links for the ground station, etc., and then an airframe that will carry your hardware and payload comfortably.

It's possible you'll find an integrated package with all of that included that will fit your needs, either proprietary or open source hardware. Of the former, the Tello might be one. Of the latter, I know of ArduBee, a single-board copter (in which the PCB is the drone's frame) built for ArduPilot, and MicroHawk, which is purpose-built to fit a Raspberry Pi Zero.

Finally: You'll need to learn to fly the thing manually. No excuses.

No matter what, accidents with UAVs happen. Software bugs or other malfunctions that are capable of leading to an accident are even more common. Especially when it's your own prototype code. It's not a question of if, but when. And just losing the aircraft is one of the better outcomes. A multicopter is inherently dangerous. It's a flying blender with sharp blades connected to a half-kilo brick, which is often traveling at 50+ km/h. You do not want it to fly into anything that you care about. So unless you're only going to fly in a very unpopulated area and run a hundred meters away from the thing before each launch, you must at least learn the basics of flying a drone, in both stabilized (attitude) and acro (rate) modes, to the point of being confident enough in your abilities to assume manual control at any moment if the aircraft starts to act in a way it's not supposed to, and guide it safely to the ground.

Besides, manual piloting of both quadcopters and fixed-wing planes is fun! 

Feel free to ask for any clarification or additional details I might have missed, and I'll add it to the answer (or as a comment).

"I’m not an expert on Mars’ atmosphere or planetary conditions, but there are several aspects that you’d need to consider.

The first is that the atmosphere on Mars is very thin - equivalent to an altitude of around 35Km on Earth according to this source. You’d need a propulsion system that could cope with that.

Another thing to consider is that Mars does not have a GPS system as such - the number of satellites is relatively small compared to Earth and, as far as I am aware, they are primarily for scientific research.

You would also have to consider that Mars does not have a magnetic field in the same way that Earth does - it’s magnetic field is formed via interactions with solar wind. This would likely negate the possibility of having a compass to replace GPS.

It is also cold on Mars - according to this source, the average temperature on Mars is -60°C - far too cold for our standard electronics (especially batteries) to function.

Mars also has very high radiation levels. This means that you would have to protect the electronics from radiation.

Finally, you should also consider the fairly frequent and intense sand storms on Mars that would make operating an aircraft very hazardous.

"7"" props have a disk area that is almost twice as large as 5"" props, so the motors will be heavily overloaded. (7 squared is 49, 5 squared is 25, the other terms in the equation for the area of a circle cancel out)

Assuming you use 5x4.5 3-blade props on a 5"" quad, you could reduce the load 33% by switching to 2-blade props. You can reduce the load further with a lower pitch prop. 7x3 is about as low as you can find, and will give you another 33% reduction, so now the motors are only running at 133%.

I think that's worth a try, but if the motors get hot you may need to step down to 6"" props. 6x4 props may work better than 7x3, giving you more speed.

Reducing throttle to 70% will reduce the maximum voltage, similar to switching to 3s batteries. However torque and heating are related to current. Reducing voltage will limit the maximum power and thus the maximum current, but won't make any difference at part throttle.

"Looking through that page, the F450 FlameWheel style kits are still available, and a reasonable choice for a DIY Ardupilot drone. These are about twice the size of a typical FPV quad and will give you more room for sensors and/or a gimbaled camera. Alternately, if you think everything you want will fit on a 250mm FPV frame (they can carry GPS and a fixed GoPro), there are lots of cheap components due to the popularity of FPV.

I would agree with the advice to also buy a cheap toy quad to learn the reflexes you need to fly, and for when your friends want to try flying. They're so cheap now that it's a tiny fraction of the cost of a bigger multi-copter. You won't find any running Ardupilot though, as the flight controllers are too expensive.

The Hubsan X4 H107 is still available - watch out for the different versions, there's a basic version, one with a recording-only camera (that's a bit pointless) and an expensive one with a low quality FPV camera. 

The Blade nano has been replaced by the Inductrix - they're quite expensive but their customer service is good.

Eachine's range of toy quads are pretty good and very cheap. The E010 or E011 both work well and can often be found for $10-15. The E012 is smaller but only flies for a minute or two. The protected props make them strong enough for beginners to learn to fly indoors, but they can be flown outdoors in light winds. I would suggest ordering a few spare batteries - one is never enough.

Some of Eachine's range (like the E016) have altitude-hold, which seems like a great idea, as holding a constant altitude is one of the first challenges to learning to fly (especially indoors) - however I've found these need extra trimming to hover accurately and really aren't suitable for a beginner unless you've got an experienced helper to trim it each flight.

"Since only you can be the judge of what you feel is too loud, and noise level from a drone is the result of many parts working together, this is a tough question to answer and I'm not sure you will succeed in finding ""the"" prop to suit your needs.  That said, if reduced noise is what you are looking for, and we remove the other parts of the drone from the equation, I'd suggest stiffer props from the manufacturer of your choice.  After flying for a while, if you feel that the noise level is getting worse, change props (all of them).

In my experience, as long as the props are balanced (most manufacturers have gotten better and producing consistently balanced props), on the stiffer side, clean, and free of any kinks or abrasions, they will be as quiet as they can be.  This is why drones sound quieter when they are first flown compared to after a few landings when they get grass and other debris sticking to them, along with abrasions and kinks on them - making them less efficient and more noisy as a result.

I use DALPROP T5045C and HQ R38 props.  Both are on the stiffer side and both are quieter than the thinner, more flexible props I had used a few years ago.

That being said, there are a few assumptions you can make.
Since the weight goes up, the inertia goes up as well. So it will respond slower to stick movements and will have a bigger tendency to overshoot. To compensate for the slower reaction you can increase the P-gain and/or feedforward. To fight the overshoot (and the effect of the bigger P-gain) you will need to increase the D-gain as well.

"It's possible that the stuttering in your footage is due to a combination of factors, including low light conditions and the use of HDR mode. HDR mode requires the camera to capture multiple exposures of the same scene and combine them to produce a single image with more detail in both the highlights and shadows. This process can take a bit longer and may result in stuttering if the camera is trying to capture fast-moving subjects or scenes with a lot of motion.
Additionally, H.265 encoding is known to be more demanding on the hardware than H.264, so if your computer or playback device is not powerful enough, it may struggle to play back the footage smoothly.
To avoid this stuttering issue, you could try the following:

Use a higher frame rate: Shooting at 60fps or higher can help capture fast-moving subjects more smoothly.
Disable HDR mode: Try recording without HDR mode and see if that
improves the smoothness of your footage.
Use a faster memory card: While the Sandisk Extreme 128GB microSD is
a fast card, it may not be fast enough for your particular use case.
You could try using a faster card, such as the Sandisk Extreme Pro,
which has higher write speeds.
Use a different video codec: H.264 encoding is less demanding on
hardware than H.265, so you could try recording in H.264 to see if
that improves the smoothness of your footage.
Avoid shooting in low-light conditions: If possible, try to shoot in
well-lit environments to avoid issues with low light.

It's worth noting that some degree of stuttering may be unavoidable, especially in challenging shooting conditions. However, by trying the above steps, you should be able to improve the smoothness of your footage.

"The sort of sensors and equipment you are talking about would fit on a 250mm frame (measured diagonally, between motor centres), which is the 'standard' outdoor FPV size that takes 5&quot; props. Below this size, things don't really get any cheaper but it gets a lot harder to squeeze everything into the frame.
If you need more space, the F450 'Flame wheel' frame is pretty standard for development drones. It's heavy and fragile compared to an 250 frame though, and everything is more expensive, so I'd stay small if you can.
'Programmable' is difficult to define as almost no one writes their own code, yet the dividing line between 'toy' and 'hobby' grade is when the flight controller has a USB port and can be flashed with (usually) open-source firmware such as BetaFlight, and the PIDs and flight modes configured.
Most flight controllers only have a couple of inputs, one of which is used for the RC receiver. The other is for people who want to add a GPS (and some flight controllers have built in barometer and compass). In theory then, you could do everything with a standard flight controller, if you can work out how to modify BetaFlight, and you're careful to leave it enough CPU time to fly the drone.
Alternately you could handle navigation on the ESP32 and just send the flight controller commands as if it was the RC receiver.
The next step up are the flight controllers designed for autonomous flight, such as the Pixhawk. They have a lot more inputs and software for setting up waypoint missions. They are more expensive though.
You probably don't need the button cell, most people use a PDB (power distribution board) to split the battery wires to the motors, and they usually also contain a 12v and 5v regulator, and often the flight controller also provides 3.3v
Finally, you're unlikely to stay under 250g so you need to register as a drone operator with the CAA. It's only £9 and you can take the multi-choice test as many times as necessary. The rules are pretty simple (don't fly near things you wouldn't want to hit!) but you should read them to make sure you don't accidently break the law. You should also consider buying some insurance, it's pretty cheap from FPVUK or the BMFA.

"This is the best damned reference on rotations: Representing Attitude: Euler Angles, Unit Quaternions, and Rotation by James Diebel of Stanford University (dated  2006-10-20).
You didn't specify, but you're almost certainly using the Tait-Bryan convention-- which is first yaw, then pitch, then roll-- for rotation axes. You're also possibly using NED for translation axes, but that's less clear.
You can see all the mappings in Sec. 5.6.1 in the above link. You might check that you have correctly mapped your quaternions to the rotation matrix. It's very easy to mess up a sign value. Pay special attention to the fact that the inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, so it's very easy to have the right rotation matrix values but in the transposed order.
To get to your specific question, using eqn. 35, you can see how to map an inertial frame acceleration into the body frame, using the rotation matrix. It's a simple matrix multiplication, and in your case, and assuming NED, the vector z is [0;0;9.805].
Lastly, I would suggest getting this to work in simulation first, before trying empirical. Rotations are tricky because they're so pedantic, and it's easy to approach them backwards.
",Finding the velocity and position for small distance from IMU sensors,"I am working on finding Velocity and Displacement from an IMU sensor (MPU9250). I have a Navio2 RPi4 setup, which gives me raw data (acceleration, Gyro, Magnetic).
As per my research this can be done in following method;

Finding the Attitude from the raw data. (Using quaternion method or Transformation Matrix)

Once the attitude data is available, calculate the gravity force acting on the acceleration data and eliminate the gravity from Acceleration to find the Linear Acceleration

Integrate the computed Linear Acceleration to find the velocity and Position.


Following the steps above I was able to compute the Attitude from the IMU sensor by following the  example provided by Navio2. The example uses Quaternion method (Mahony filter) to fuse the raw data and give the quaternions.
The output is verified and works perfectly. Now I have to move to step 2 i.e, finding the gravity acting on the acceleration.
Using quaternions to find the gravity :
gx = (2 * (q1 * q3 - q0 * q2));
gy = (2 * (q0 * q1 + q2 * q3));
gz = ((q0 * q0) - (q1 * q1) - (q2 * q2) + (q3 * q3));

This gravity values are subtracted from the acceleration data to find the linear acceleration. Once the linear acceleration is available, integrating it with the time gives the velocity and position. The implementation is experimented by moving the IMU sensor to 100cm. However the position output is not as expected. The units of the raw data have been taken care just to have a sanity check with the implementation.
I have moved to convert the quaternions back to rotation matrix and compute the velocity and position data.
My question is how to find the gravity acting on the acceleration using the Rotation Matrix converted from Quaternion.
I request the community to help me with their valuable inputs and references.
Thanks.

"The risk of a puffy battery exploding during storage is still comparatively low, you shouldn't underestimate it however.
During charging the risk of explosion is at its peak. This is also the reason why you charge your batteries slower than you discharge them (i.e. to lower the risk of puffing and explosions, as well as to keep wear and tear low).
During use, the risk is quite high as well, though I'd say it's lower than while charging.
Always, always get rid of them as quickly as you can. Exploding LiPos are not a joke. Besides, a puffy LiPo has a far lower total capacity, rendering it basically useless for flying anyway (though don't be fooled - the explosion is still more than dangerous).

"In my opinion, the communication protocol between your receiver and the FC cannot damage the ESC.
If you ever reverse powered the FC it is possible that something broke on the FC that ripples through to the ESC but I don't think that is likely.
A big reason for burning ESCs is overvoltage. When the motors are used (even for the beeping noises at startup), they can generate extremely high voltage spikes.
The best way to deal with this is to put a big capacitor on the battery voltage rail. The battery is not fast enough to eat up these spikes but a capacitor is.
So check if the capacitor is still properly connected, preferably as close to the ESCs as possible.
",ESC burned twice,"I got burned my ESC twice, this makes me think this is not a coincidence, but I'm doing something wrong. Would be glad if someone would be able to point it out.
I have a simple drone, with the following specs:

FC - F3 Deluxe 10DOF
ESC - Eachine Wizard X220
Motors - Racerstar 2205 2300KV
Battery - 3S

Originally I used FS-iA6B receiver and everything was good. Util I saw positive feedback about FS X6B recevier. I swithed to X6B but wrongly connected the wires, and after I attached the battery my back right ESC smoked.
I use PPM to communicate among receiver and FC, so there are 3 wires: plus, ground and data.
There were no suitable cables to connect X6B to FC that came with them, so I soldered wires and made an error.
The error was that I swapped the plus and ground wires.
Still, this is pretty strange, even if receiver is connected wrongly and tells nuts to FC, this shouldn't get ESC to go crazy and burn itself.
I bought a new ESC of same model, fixed the wiring issue and went to flight. The first battery was perfect. But when I connected the second one - same back right ESC (this time a brand new one) smoked again and burned.
I'm interested to know if someone had similar experience of same ESC being burned twice, and what should be done to fix this. Is this some sort of incompatibility of the parts I'm using?
I'd like to avoid switching back to FS-iA6B, since X6B mounts much nicer in stack above FC and PDB.

"let me clarify a few things that may help you decide on direction, if any, to take.  Your question is not really something anyone can objectively answer because you need to consider what your level of dedication to FPV is first. And of course rand loyalty is nothing short of a cult like relationship (#kiss)
Off the shelf &quot;racing drones&quot; don't exist.  The term &quot;racing&quot; is applied everywhere, but very few units will compete against real custom drones.
A racing drone is a bad teacher I would not recommend that path for a first unit.
First - you must learn to fly FPV (rate/acro format) first, and a real racing drone with a high camera angle and a drivetrain for racing is a recipe for a bag of broken drone parts.  A mellow drone to learn on, including LoS (line of sight) is key.  Generally speaking the learning curve generates a lot of damage.
But if you want an RTF &quot;racing drone&quot; buy one form GetFPV or a similar larger vendor.
As a pilot with over 10k flights and the distinct opportunity to coach and train many people on FPV flight over the years I highly recommend using a small repairable RTF and learning how to fly, land, gap, and not get hurt first.
Next is your level of dedication. To fly FPV effectively you need to be able to scratch build and repair.  Drones, especially racing units, break a lot and you need to have a pit crew (usually yourself).  Anything other than full dominion on your build is a waste of time.
The #1 problem in FPV is &quot;going cheap&quot;.  If budget is a concern walk away right now.
I DO NOT RACE but each of my 5&quot; builds are similar in spec to a racing unit. Here are my operational costs as a dedicated FPV pilot.  Each 5&quot; unit is $500-1200 in the air + my goggles (modded, high end) $700, controller (upgraded+customized) $500.  Batteries are minimum $40 per and I am lucky to get 20 solid flights before sag hits, then another 20-30 before retired. So $1/flight in battery, when I factor in other year to year decay it costs me about $2-3/flight.  I keep around 100 batteries active,  a minimum 10 is required for a typical session.  With the exception of new builds I spend about $200/month in upkeep for a modest fleet - comparable to any racer.  I mention this because the hobby (not a sport) is quite expensive, lots of breaks, tons of crap gear and advice.
I don't mean to discourage you, but to race or fly with any serious intent is a legit commitment.  The #1 path to success is having a friend teach and support you.  I blew 3 ESCs on my first build's first power up - an experience like that is very common.  I buy motors in multiples of 5 because they go poof.  Everything I do is aimed to have high quality builds and minimal down time and repair.
As for the learning curve - the path I suggest is getting the right controller first and connecting USB to a simulator.  If you ever bail, the transmitter will not loose a lot of value.  After that get a cheap $90 nano unit and learn to fly LoS, exercises like &quot;walking the dog&quot; for LoS flight will teach you how the drone reacts in the world, knowledge critical for safe and sustained FPV flight.  From there, grab either a nice RTF or start building.  5&quot; drones are more expensive, but smaller units are a more difficult build from scratch. I consider 5&quot; @500-700g AUW to be the sweet spot.
I may not be the norm, but despite an aviation background, all of my childhood and adult life playing video games, and having a lot of RC experience, FPV flight was very hard for me to master.  I made a lot of mistakes and my post here is intended to make you, or anyone, think about the reality of FPV.  There is a lot of peripheral gear and disposable elements plus a lot of breakage all the time (if racing or pushing the envelope). I knew the first time I saw FPV (via Trappy in 2012) that this was the hobby for the rest of my life. If you feel that way too - jump in.

"Short answer. Buy a new battery.
I heavily researched this and although there may be another solution I will share my experience.
The Mavic batteries have complex circuitry in them to maintain stability and longevity.  This is partly why the Mavic charger will not revive the battery.
Is there a way to manually charge it?  Well the answer is yes and no.   The cells inside the battery are probably okay if the battery did not deplete this far while in storage.  The problem is the circuitry will not allow a manual charge above failsafe levels restoring to a functioning DJI battery.   There are some videos and reports of people cracking open their batteries and doing various physical things to the circuitry to fix this issue.  I do not recommend this.  I found that opening the Mavic battery was not easy and left the battery case in disrepair due to it being glued or affixed with single use fasteners.  If there is a tool that can open the battery case gracefully i don’t believe it is something in a standard tool box.  On top of that the Mavic circuitry is precise to avoid radio interference and modding that could increase radio interference.
Once the battery was open, poorly, I was able to charge directly to the main leads.  The battery stack read about 10.5 to 10.6 volts on 3 cells.  Very low.  My hobby charger pulled it up to 11.1 volts static.  I was still unable to charge using the Mavic charger.  This led me to believe the circuitry remembers the charge state of the battery and will not continue if that battery has inconsistent untracked voltage changes.
I saw another video that shows desoldering the positive terminal while the balance lines are disconnected.   Then soldering it back.  I tried this and it did seem to refresh the charge level readout, but i still could not charge using the Mavic charger.  With my battery split open and looking like it would never be allowed in checked or carry on baggage i gave up and decommissioned the battery using a method that worked for me.  Once the battery became inert it could be disposed of properly.
I suggest contacting DJI before opening the case. Maybe they have a trade in policy or something when the Mavic depletes the battery too low?
Best bet is to get a new battery.

"There are a few things that may be happening.
Tighter and flying bad screams bad mounting.  A prototype I was working on last week had this problem. As I tightened the motor, the c-clip on the base was rubbing on the arm and slowing down. Loosen the screw and it spins faster. To check for this, take the motor off and spin it with your hand and get a feel for how much it will &quot;free spin&quot;. If you mount it and this &quot;free spin&quot; decreases then you want to look for friction.  Leave the leads disconnected when you are going to do this, as some motors will retain residual electricity and until drained they will spin slow (this is a false positive, so test everything unplugged)
Generally speaking motors are built to be bolted down REALLY TIGHT, so there is probably operator error going on.
Another very common problem is the mounting screw length.  There are 2 things I have run into related to mounting motors and screw length. First is the possibility that the screw is too long and is actually hitting something in the internals. If so, look for damage and/or compare amp draw with other motors, watch for higher heat, and be careful. The other more mystical problem is when the screw is too long, somewhat metallic or electromagnetic, and alters the magnetic field of the motor.  I have had his happen a few times and it is often not obvious.
Another possibility is that the motor and/or mount is warped. In this case, tightening can further disfigure or warp it and decrease performance.  Many elements on a motor should be parallel/perpendicular to other parts and that can help you see if a crash bent something.

"Practically speaking, &quot;plus&quot; blocks the camera and has a different flight characteristic, especially when landing as you can drag a single arm if not &quot;flat&quot; and the chance of using the arms to level out is more difficult.
A big disadvantage is how a plus crashes.  A plus design generally will be arm first and will not crumble like an &quot;X&quot; might. I don't fly plus because my crashes would be so much worse (50+mph cartwheels, fences,  buildings, you name it)
I agree with @Robin Bennet, but that point is also moot in many scenario, especially FPV as the power to weight ratio is intense.  I have 5 inch drones that legitimately rotate in excess of 1000 degrees per second on pitch and roll.
The flight controller will need to know of the configuration of course.
Another advantage of &quot;X&quot; over plus is the rotational nature of the propellers.  I use a reversed spin.  (see image, credit https://blog.seidel-philipp.de/)
By using reversed direction I am able to fly through grass and trees better because the props push debris away (not pull them in). Two props in the front pushing out has saved me from certain crash very often.  I switched about 3 years ago and I can say that recovery from bumps is vastly improved. I also note easier take off as well from a lawn, less instance of things getting tangled, plus my camera lenses are not chipped as much from sand reflections and ingestion because the props work more actively to not throw junk into the drone, prop-wash notwithstanding.

In the end it is a preference, there are mild advantages to both but most to lean towards X for performance and logistical reasons.  I see plus format very infrequently, usually someone experimenting.  I hope that helps.

"This is an age old problem, there is no solution, only methodology.
First, your budget is a HUGE constraint.  To build a drivetrain, without years of experience, is very difficult, I doubt you will nail it.
The approach you use to decide motor is critical, more on that as we progress.
Some things to consider FIRST:

what are your power train expectations? 10+:1 power:weight is what I use and my drone get's the hell out of town, but I also cook batteries; able to set them on fire punching out if I choose.
What is your desired type of flight, the spectrum goes from freestyle/race to sit-n-spin (hover and take photos).
What flight time would you like (short or long?)

As I am sure you know already, pitch and KV are related. High KV leans lower pitch (faster spin with blades that push less air). Low KV leans higher pitch (low KV should have more torque and allow steep pitch to push more air).
High KV build tend to have shorter flights but are more maneuverable.  Lower KV builds stay up longer and are amenable to cinematography (generally).  There are tuning specific problems across the spectrum.
The characteristics of motors generally in XXYY configuration vary greatly. xx is the rotor diameter and yy is the motor/rotor height.  Wider diameter motors have a different inertial footprint than narrow, carrying more weight to help keep the big props swinging.  Narrow can stop/accelerate/decelerate faster, again inertia is a big part of the formula.  Height of rotor is less impactful from my experience in the context of this discussion, generally a product of the diameter and desired KV (more height to wrap more wire, for example).
A 2000kv motor [example] ranges from 15xx to 25xx sizes, so KV is a hard indicator to use alone.  KV is key for calculating the target max rotational speed in conjunction with your voltage.  I have used the exact same KV motors in a small and large format and the difference was astonishing.  The takeaway is that KV helps determine relative spin rate and is not helpful as a stand alone metric.
Keep in mind that rotational speed of the propellers is huge. Bigger slower moving props do not provide the same gyroscopic byproduct as a fast spinning motor, this may be something to consider.  There are all sorts of RPM specific problems along this spectrum.
On to props.  Generally props use a AABB format where AA is the diameter and BB is the pitch. Pitch, generally speaking, is how much &quot;screw&quot; the prop will move along the motor shaft axis per rotation.  When teaching new pilots I explain pitch as &quot;how far a prop will move in a block of jello spinning 360 degrees&quot;.  So a steep prop will move far while a shallow prop will not move very far [in this mental exercise].  A good internal understanding of pitch takes a while.
Battery choice is difficult.  Decision 1 is cell count (voltage). Decision 2 is mah (amount of energy stored) and generally an indicator of weight for the battery. Last is C rating (abuse factor). Mellow units can fly &quot;well&quot; on 25c, high performance need 75C+, my 5&quot; cinema/chase drones need 95c+ (usually 120c).If you miss the C rating (too low) you will puff battery, decrease life dramatically, and generally be pretty upset with performance.
So to answer your question, there are a few ways to go, but first you will need to have budget to fail and try again, that is the nature of scratch builds, especially for someone lacking extensive power train building experience.  Drone building is a constant repair cycle, that is why people who take this seriously travel with mirror+ builds, I usually carry 4+ units for a shoot or session.
The easy route is to buy a pre-built where payload and performance as well as demo videos are available.
The next route is to join a flying club or commercial group and check out other builds and get some local friends to guid the choice.  This is my #1 recommendation to new pilots - let a friend help. Otherwise you will be flailing in places like here listening to a lot of armchair pilots pushing their agenda and favorite builds.
The next approach is to copy a build that fits your needs. The largest repository of builds is RotorBuilds (https://rotorbuilds.com/), nice filters, tons of videos, and possibly contact info to ask questions directly.
The last way to go is take a stab at it. That is what I did in 2013, I failed and essentially smoked a whole drone worth of parts before my first flight. I copied Charpu's build (he was #1 at the time) and it was a painful experience without any coaching.  Granted times have changed, but the information on the web is mostly garbage.
It feels safe to assume that you wanted XXYY motor and AABB prop on target voltage. I can't deliver than information, I doubt anyone without intimate knowledge of your use case will be much help.  Ergo, the approach and methodology to solving the problem becomes key.
DroneTrest has a good reference page (https://www.dronetrest.com/t/brushless-motors-how-they-work-and-what-the-numbers-mean/564)  if you have not been here already.
If you want to dig in then seek out motor specification sheets.  There are many sites dedicated to this (I have no favorite).  Look at motor+volt+prop mah draw (avg/max) and heat if available.  This information is great, but unfortunately it will not help a lot without drivetrain building experience.
",How to decide drone motors?,"I'm planning to design a quadcopter with a payload capacity of 5 kg. I would need the thrust power from the motors to cater for at-least 7 kg with extra part weights.
I would like to know,

How do I decide the motor power? (I can do only one-off investment for that with my budget and no chance for trial and error.)
How do I decide the blade sizes? (for this I can spend little extra trying a few different blades.)

",https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/1573/how-to-decide-drone-motors
"The key here is to understand pitch speed. The pitch of a prop is how far it will advance in one rotation if there's no slip, so a 5&quot; pitch prop spinning at 15,000rpm will advance 75,000 inches per minute, or about 70mph. That means that when your plane reaches 70mph, the prop cannot produce any thrust.
Now, exactly how much thrust is required to reach any particular speed is very hard to estimate, and how thrust drops off with speed is also hard to estimate, but it's safe to say that the above plane will have a top (level) speed of under 70mph.
The first step is to look at the recommended prop for your motor. Often it will say something like this:

Use on 2s with 9×4.7 slow fly or the GWS 9×5 direct drive propellers.
Can also be used on 3s with 8×4 or 7×3.5 propellers.

Here you can see how increasing battery voltage spins the prop faster and requires a smaller prop to keep the power within the motor's limits.
A larger, lower-pitch prop (or a smaller, high-pitch prop) will have roughly the same power requirements. The normal rule of thumb is to add an inch of diameter when you reduce the pitch by an inch, or the other way around. So if a motor can handle an 8x4, it could also handle 9x3, 7x5 or 6x6.
The larger prop will have more thrust, but the smaller, higher-pitch prop will have a higher pitch speed, and thus a higher maximum possible speed. Prop pitch is a lot like gears on a car of bicycle. Too low and the top speed will be very limited, too high and it'll be hard to get going.
Here you need to go back to rules-of-thumb. Props are made in a range of sizes that are useful for most models. Generally the highest pitch option is the same as the diameter (a so-called 'square prop') and is only useful to very fast, sleek models like pylon racers. Models with more drag will need more thrust, and won't need the high pitch speed.
For that motor, you'd use the following props on these types of model:
6x6 - pylon racer.
7x5 - 'sports' aerobatics or flying wing
8x4 - trainer
9x3 - 3D aerobatics (i.e. prop-hanging) or slow 'vintage' flight.
You can use the same proportions for other motors: a 'square' prop for speed, diameter = 2 * pitch for a trainer, etc.
If you're not sure, order a prop either side of what you think the ideal will be and see which you prefer. Props are relatively cheap and you'll probably need replacements at some point.
Ideally you should also test a new motor/prop combination on the bench with a Watt-Meter, so check it's not pulling more current than recommended (or the ESC can handle) but you can also just check how warm the motor gets when run for 30 seconds or a minute. Warm is fine, but if the motor gets hot, you'll have to be careful in the air until you're sure the extra airflow is enough to keep it cool.
",Picking the right prop pitch for my plane,"Sorry for all the questions, but I'm trying to figure out what I need before ordering a hundred dollars worth of stuff and then find out I got the wrong stuff.
So from what I understand of this site, which isn't much, if you want your plane to be slower you use a bigger propeller. I think that sounds good for my first plane so I'll get a big propeller(size is still up in the air until I figure out how big to make the plane, but I'm leaning towards a jumbo sized foam plane and modifying that), but then how do you decide what pitch to get on the propeller? I'll be using a low Kv motor (about 1500)so I guess I need a low pitch propeller, but I still have 0 experience with planes so some help would be appreciated.

"The capacity and C-rating don't tell you how long the battery will last, just how quickly you could discharge it if you really wanted to do it as fast as possible.
It's perhaps analogous to the top speed of a car - just because your car can reach 120mph doesn't mean that a journey of 120miles will take an hour. Most of the time you'll never reach that top speed.
A high C rating is like having a really big fuel hose on a car. You might need it on a dragster but it won't make an ordinary car any faster, or use fuel any faster.

"You might be able to write custom flight control software for a multi-copter that would simulate this. You might get close just by radically limiting the pitch and roll rates and being gentle on the throttle. In either case it wouldn't be intrinsic to the design.
If you want smooth, soaring flight, you'd be best to build a fixed wing model with a fairly large wing span and low weight, similar to a soaring bird.

"When you're racing around a course, you're not just using visual references. You're using your knowledge of where everything is from having flown the course before many times.
If you watch videos of other people flying through gates (or around trees, or whatever) you often can't tell where they're planning to fly, yet the quad still curves around smoothly and the gate/gap only appears at the last moment. There's no last minute wobble as they hurriedly adjust their course because they've flown that same course so many times.
If you just set up a few gates and try to fly around 'freestyle', it's really hard. However, if you fly the same sequence of gates repeatedly, you'll find yourself getting smoother and faster with every battery. Don't try to fly faster, aim to fly as smoothly as possible and hit the gates as central as possible, and then your speed will naturally improve. You'll learn that after some gates you need to turn hard for the next one, and after others you set up a smooth curve that naturally takes in one gate while lining up for the next one.
If you set up the same course each session, you'll notice even quite small differences in the position of the gates because a path that would previously have lined you up nicely for the next gate no longer works and needs to be re-learnt.

Then the problem is that all the gear we use is based on old CCTV chips rather than having been developed specifically for FPV (which is one reason the channel allocations are such a mess). I guess no one built a CCTV system for just one HD camera - multiple cameras are important in CCTV, and lag isn't an issue, so they could use digital compression.
So, I guess the cost to develop a custom system is the big issue, especially if it might have a limited market, or become obsolete in a few years as faster, cheaper processors allow digital systems to overtake it.
",Is it possible to transmit a high-resolution image over an analogue signal?,"As digital video signals become more popular, there is a growing question; Why can't we just create a higher resolution analogue system? Are there actual limitations of the technology that prevent it?
So far, I have thought of a few potential reasons why analogue transmissions remain low-resolution:

Existing equipment (people already have goggles/cameras with set resolutions)
Not wanting to give up bandwidth (racers in particular need to have enough bandwidth for multiple pilots)
Lack of interest (people might just not care enough to change analogue)
Cost (depending on what would have to happen to create a high-resolution analogue system, it may end up being even more expensive than digital)
Not possible (it might just be beyond the capabilities of current technology)

Several of these reasons, however, would also prevent people from changing to a high-resolution digital system. They would need new (expensive) equipment for digital, and most digital systems have less available channels because they use more bandwidth.
Would it be possible, though, to create a new analogue system that transmits a high-resolution image? Even if it took so much bandwidth that only two people could fly simultaneously and it required new cameras/goggles/VTXs, it could still be worth it.
And if it was possible, would it actually be worth it, or might it be better to go digital?

"You need to be specific about what IMU hardware you are using, like a general purpose IC like MPU6050 (gyro + accelerometer), or flight controllers like  Pixhawk, pixRacer, etc ..
In Order for you to achieve a fine tuned, linear input-output response, you need to take care of few things firsts and accept some constraints :

you cannot fully get rid of vibrations, but hopefully you can reduce it to an extent by using  anti-vibration absorber like this



You cannot achieve a linear relationship between input and output signals. This is mainly due to limitations of The flight hardware you are using
In the end, the goal is get proper output signals rather than reduce vibrations. this can be achieved  by


1)Research more about your IMU hardware, like manufacturers Datasheet, or asking with the community

The reason why you are getting a change in pitch angle is due to its internal offset of various parameters associated with its IC manufacturing.

Coming to UAVs, you need to implement your own PID algorithms by using digital filters like Kalman Filter, or you can choose Open Source flight firmwares for your IMU hardware.

After implementing and testing your filter, you need to fine tune it by hooking the output to a DSO and modifying the filter coefficients to suit your needs. A lot of trial and error goes into finding the tuning parameters like Kp, Ki, and Kd.


",Eliminate effect of Vibrations on IMU,"I am testing pitch orientation correction of Quadcopter and ended up in a issue.
I have a test setup with one degree of freedom to test orientation correction. I have fixed the drone to the setup and basically trying to test pitch correction by feeding a desired pitch angle and current pitch angle from IMU. The AHRS code uses Mahony filter to fuse the sensor data from Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. When I start my testing and spin the motors, can see the current pitch angle varying (or Oscillating). When I test without spinning the motors, the pitch angle is much precise. I observed that when the motors spin, a lot of vibration is generated and i doubt this is affecting the sensor to result in inaccurate output.
My question is

How can the vibration effect be nullified on the IMU sensor? By using some hardware component?
If it can be handled using Software, please let me know.

Thanks

"Lower kV motors will spin more slowly but with more torque. Spinning more slowly (with the same prop) will give you less thrust and less power (and thus lower current) at full throttle.
However, a well setup quad doesn't spend much time at full power, especially when you're considering your total flight time. The amount of thrust required to fly is still the same because the weight and drag haven't changed, so if the props are the same they will still need to spin at the same speed. To reach that speed, you'll need more throttle. Top speed will be reduced and if that leaves you flying more slowly than before, your flight times will increase - but you could probably get the same effect just by flying more slowly.
There may be some difference due to the relative efficiencies of the two motors, but it will be small. I don't know which would be better and you probably won't notice it.
However, that assumes you keep the same props. A lower kV motor really needs larger props, so it can generate the same thrust at lower RPM. Larger props should be more efficient because they act on more air and don't have to move it as fast. That should give you longer flight times and more thrust at low speed, with a possible reduction in top speed.
Of course, all that is irrelevant if your frame doesn't have space for larger props.

","Drone with SDR for HF antenna field strength measurements, I need a Raspberry Pi based drone kit that I can just buy","I have very little time until I get to the USA to buy the material to put together a drone which I want to use to measure antenna gain patterns for HF radio. Example, a 20m band half-wavelength dipole antenna is 10 m wide and should be mounted 10 m above ground, probably it will have to be less. Additional parasitic elements of about 10 m wide spans are added around the main driven element to achieve directional gain.
The issue is measuring this gain for which one needs to get two wave lengths away and up all around the antenna assembly, which is easily 100 m all around. And for 40m, 80m, 160m band antennas it would scale accordingly.
The measurement device we would need to lift up is an SDR (software defined radio) device, which can be as small as a USB dongle, along with some small receiving antenna. The drone would fly around the transmitting antenna and would measure the antenna's gain pattern on a set of chosen frequencies and transmit power while we would be intermittently transmitting our call sign in Morse code like a beacon. Given the fact that it's an experimental antenna assembly, the drone should re-take the same flight path several times as we adjust the setup.
Since an SDR dongle needs to be plugged into a USB port of a computer running some Linux, the Raspberry PI comes to mind. And to avoid having to carry that as extra payload, I want to have a drone which has a PI as its main control and communication module.
I have seen several PI drone projects, dating as far back as 2016, but even after all that time I have not seen an affordable kit. It should be around $200, as even in 2016 a ZDnet article talked about a DIY PI drone in that budget. Since I have very little time to get the parts together while on a short visit to the USA before returning to South America where everything is twice as expensive, I would like to find something that I can just buy. Do you know of a kit or a state of the art shopping list that is based on a generic drone kit?

"The beep from the transmitter indicates that it has linked successfully with the receiver on the drone, so at least part of the board is working. However without detailed knowledge of the design and a range of test tools it will be very hard to trace the fault accurately. Even if you did, you need specialist soldering tools to replace tiny surface mounted components, and the fault may be in a chip with proprietary firmware (i.e. not available for sale).
Really the only type of repair you could do is to replace the entire board, but I'm not sure they're available and given the price of these things I think you'd be best to buy a whole new drone and keep the frame, motors and props as spares because they are the parts that usually break.

What could have gone wrong

If it was wet when the battery was connected, it's likely that the water formed a galvanic cell between the copper traces of the circuit board and some of the other metals in the solder and component legs and cases. Galvanic corrosion is much faster than ordinary corrosion, and has probably caused an open circuit somewhere.
The other option is a short circuit that generated enough heat to melt some solder and break a connection.
If you dried it thoroughly before reconnecting the battery, then you did everything you could have, and that's normally enough - but small drones are made with the cheapest components and quality control is minimal, and sometimes they do just die unexpectedly.

I inspected the circuit board and it shows no damage: no cut cables that I could solder, nothing corroded. Both the transmitter and the drone turn on and show light but the transmitter does not control the drone. I turn both on within 2 seconds of each other, push the left lever up and down and the transmitter beeps, but the controls have no effect. (Note: when the drone is turned off, the transmitter has the same behavior: beep when I push up, flashing light, beep when I push down, steady light, so the beeps do not indicate binding with the drone.)
The other drone (red color) works fine. The green transmitter can control the red drone, but neither transmitter can control the green drone. I could not find a way to reset both to factory settings.

"Ordinary FPV cameras output an analogue PAL or NTSC TV signal, which you should be able to plug straight into a TV or goggles that are intended for watching TV.
Some FPV goggles only have a receiver and no input socket, but the good ones generally allow you to change the receiver, and thus have a socket for the AV signal. (Also some of the very cheap ones are just a box for a screen from an automotive reversing camera system, and expect you to provide your own receiver)
So, skipping the radio link should be easy enough, which is good because you do get some radio 'noise', especially if you're indoors where the signal can reflect from metal objects, or where there's interference from WiFi and other electronics.
Good quality FPV cameras are generally optimised for a wide dynamic range (so you can still see details on the ground when the sun is in the picture) and low light (it's common to finish an evening flight and be surprised by how dark it really is) and low latency (for racing) but the resolution is usually fairly limited because the radio bandwidth is limited.
It gets harder if you want better resolution. The only real option from the FPV world is the DJI digital FPV system, but it's quite expensive and I don't think you can use it without the radio, which is integrated into the goggles. The goggles may have an HDMI socket, but the camera doesn't.
Then again, there must be HDMI cameras outside of the FPV world. A quick google shows lots of people using DSLRs, and lots of action-cams (like GoPros) have HDMI ports - although I'm not sure if they support real-time video, or just replay. Also, any form of digital processing introduces some lag, and it doesn't take much to make hand-eye coordination difficult.
",2D/3D/fpv video glasses to use with external camera,"I do not have any prior experience with FPV goggles (never owned one), but now I am involved in a project where I need to connect a video or FPV glasses to an external camera through a wired connection and watch the camera view on the goggles.
It is important that it is connected to an external camera because I need to achieve that point of view. A person must be able to see his own hands through the camera if he points the camera towards the hands! This is a must.
I have been looking through the internet trying to find some potential glasses that I can test on, and I have found the following:
(Option 1), (Option 2), (Option 3), (Option 4)
Since the goggles and the video camera will always be within a close range, I am at the moment considering a wired connection. I assumed that wired should provide with better quality video compared to wireless. Is that correct? If not, there is absolutely no reason for me to go wired, and I'll go wireless.
For now, I consider wired connection, therefore the goggles must have AV or HDMI input that I could plug my camera into, which is my main concern.
Few questions I have regarding this project

Wired vs Wireless communication between the goggles and the camera? Is it true that using wireless will reduce the preview video quality?

AV or HDMI? I was planning to use an FPV camera such as this, and connect it to my goggles through an AV cable. However, I am concerned about the video quality. Will the HDMI provide better quality video? In that case, I must consider glasses that have hdmi input and must find a small camera that I would be able to conveniently mount on a stick (planning to use something like a selfie stick).


The price is not the biggest problem here. I am willing to spend extra to achieve very good quality video preview through the goggles.

"The discovery frame uses the old DJI plastic arms and the arms are not very stiff. So you get a lot of flex in the arms. This leads to two major problems: vibrations and the quad has a relative long delay until force of one motor really starts to rotate the quad. This problem gets amplified if you are using out of balance motors or very felxible propellers. This would explain the unstable flight you are describing.
I'm afraid that this is a &quot;hardware problem&quot; and not a &quot;software problem&quot; that you can fix with some PID settings. Modern flight controller firmware is built with certain assumptions about the used frames/escs/motors. A 10 inch prop on a 810KV motor with 3S and a plastic frame isn't a target platform for betaflight or any other race/freestyle oriented FC firmware.
What are your options? Make the frame as rigid as possible and try to dampen the FC so you get rid of the vibrations (e.g. put double sided tape under it). I don't know what FC you are using but try to get some blackbox logs to see the frequency range of the vibrations and try to add more filtering to clean up the signal for the FC. After that you can start to tune the PIDs and maybe get a flyable quad. You can tune the quad without any flips and rolls because with a low power/weight ratio the quad will probably crash in the process. So just tune the quad for regular forward flight.

The quadcopter has an asymmetrical mass distribution since the heavy battery pack at the back causes the weight to be heavily skewed towards the back. The quad is really unstable and a pain to even hover properly, even in angle/horizon.
I was going through another thread on this stackexchange, and was trying with low PIDs to no avail. Turns out I need high PID gain for a craft with low power to weight ratio (around 8 : 3). My tune still seems to have some issues, since my quad was still having oscillations and it suddenly lost altitude and slammed hard into the ground when faced with a sudden gust of wind while hovering at 20m. Doing fast moves like rolls and flips with this quad doesn't really appear to be a good idea before setting up the PIDs properly since it is a bit to large and risky. Most of the tutorials I have followed seem to be stuck on gauging response to sharp turns and pitches and rolls, so I am not sure how to go about it. Increasing I or decreasing P and D makes the quad even not wanting to lift up from the ground, oscillating on the ground like a pendulum along the midline.

",Recommended drone for 360 HDR sky photography?,"Can someone please recommend a drone I could use for amateur 360 HDR sky photography in the USA? I hope recommendation requests like this are on-topic here.
Requirements:

I will be mounting a Ricoh Theta Z1 360 panorama camera weighing less than 200 grams on top of the drone.
The camera will be atop a 0.5 meter mast above the drone, so the center of mass will be high (This is so the drone itself will occupy a relatively small region of the panorama image)
The drone must be able to hold a moderately steady position for about a minute while acquiring the multiple images needed to construct a high dynamic range sky image (True HDR, not just tone mapped).
The altitude during image acquisition will be roughly 30 meters, to be above nearby trees, power lines, and buildings; so distant sky, clouds, sun, and mountains are the main focus of composition.
I'm technically skilled, so I can do some assembly and simple electronic work. But I don't want to make a PhD thesis out of this.

Optional:

The drone should be constructed of narrow struts, so the drone itself occupies as little of the panorama image as possible.
The drone should be paintable, so I can use color to help edit out the drone image in postprocessing.
I am a novice pilot; so I also want a recommendation for a cheap durable drone I can use to develop piloting skills before operating my real drone.
It would be nice to have some way to alternately mount my camera 0.5 meters below the drone, for landscape images, but while also protecting my $1000 camera during landing and emergencies. Remember that this camera takes an image in every direction at once, so surrounding the camera with a cage or landing gear is not an option.

Examining the definition for dshotCommandWrite we find that a variable repeats is set to 10 with the current input and that delayAfterCommandUs is set to 1000.

It works fine: I set up the packets for each motor, and then send them sequentially to each GPIO in a loop; until I set the throttle to zero, then I stop sending any packets.
However, the motors are not spinning in the proper direction so I am trying to issue ESC commands 7 and 8 and 20 and 21. My strategy is to STOP sending throttle packets entirely. Then I send command 7 (or 8, or 20, or 21) to each prop 10 times with 100ms between each command, and then turn the props back on with a nonzero throttle.
Documentation is super thin on this. I've found several sites saying special commands 7,8 or 20,21 should reverse the props, as well as different # of times the commands must be sent, etc. But I don't see a reversal.
Suggestions?

"The simple answer would be a potentiometer, as used for position feedback in a servo. You apply a voltage to the outer two contacts and measure the voltage at the moving, middle connection.
The next step would be a rotary encoder. These should give you less friction and more accuracy, if you need it.
A camera would require significant processing power, but might be viable on a larger drone. Measuring α would be tricky with a camera on the drone, but you could calculate it from the distance from the centre and the length of the tether.

You could wrap multiple layers for extra strength and can apply with a little tension to keep it taut; getting a wrinkle-free aerodynamic surface might be fiddly but it would probably fly well enough.
",What should I use to cover this plane with?,"Unsatisfied with the weight of my first model (a FT Tiny Trainer), I decided to build something lighter. Since overweight foamboard was the downfall of my first model, I decided to try reducing amount of foam by building a rib-and-stringer balsa design at with foamboard. I scaled down these plans to half scale and have assembled the fuselage and tailplane. When complete, the plane will have about 85cm wingspan and will be 65cm long.
Initially, I was planning to cover the plane with thick, semi-waterproof paper of about 300gsm thickness, and created a test section of the fuselage using the paper. Unfortunately, after putting together the ribs I found that the thick paper was too heavy and would bring no significant weight loss. I've been thinking for some weeks, but I haven't been able to come up with anything good to cover my plane in.
These are some of the things I've considered using:

Conventional covering film (specifically this brand. This would be light enough, but I'm not sure if it would adhere to foamboard. I also don't wish to buy a heat gun (apparently a hairdryer isn't enough), considering that I probably won't make more covered models in the near future.
Office paper (about 90gsm). It would be very light, but the paper would rip easily and fail on contact with any moisture. In addition, it would add almost no strength to the body.
Plastic tablecloth material (similar to this). It's light and waterproof. However, it would probably be a bit baggy and wouldn't add any strength to the body.

I'd also like the material to come in opaque white color, as the plane I'm modelling is normally white.

Look the part - wear a high-visibilty jacket with a company logo, &quot;UAV Pilot&quot; or other markings that makes you look like a professional.
Put up a sign which explains who you are and what you are doing - &quot;Drone Filming In Progress - please wait until aircraft is landed before approachng pilot. Operator: SuperDronePics Ltd, Permit number: OP-4ME33NK.&quot;
Where possible, fly with an observer/helper who can intercept interested people (police, public, etc.)
If you are flying somewhere particularly likely to attract attention, it may be worth contacting the local non-emergency number in advance. I don't expect they'll post an officer with you thoughout the flight, but it could help to cover phone calls from the public - and perhaps a police officer who radios in before approaching you.

Finally, always have all your paperwork ready to show - if you are interrputed, it looks more professional to have a folder with your permits, insurance, etc. at hand. While police interest might become annoying (especially when repetitive!) you are almost always better off just answering their questions and being helpful.

"There are a few numbers on the motor, battery and ESC which you should compare to check they are suitable.
Your motors have a current requirement (here, 11A) and your ESC must have a higher current rating than this; your 30A is very overrated but would work.
The ESC should state its acceptable voltage range - this is usually given as a voltage (e.g. 11-17V) but may also be given as the number of battery cells in series (e.g. 3S-4S.) You must use a battery which matches this range.
The battery will state its safe discharge rate (in C) and charge available (mAh.) The maximum discharge current is the 'C' rating multiplied by the battery charge in Ah, so a 45C 4500mAh (or 4.5Ah) battery can deliver a peak of $45 \times 4.5 = 202.5A$.
For your example, you've not indicated the ESC you plan to use but as most are 3S or 4S you are likely to be OK there. The discharge rate on a 4500mAh battery would be $(3 \times 30) \div 4.5 = 20C$ continuous at full ESC current (or closer to 10C with those motors.)
By using some form of Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC) or voltage regulator you should be able to use the battery to power the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

"There are a few chargers with data ports but they may not work the way you want. These chargers have so many options that a remote interface would be quite complex, and the manuals often don't give much detail about the features available. Complex chargers always wait for you to confirm that it is set to the right type of battery before charging, and require you to press a button.
I think the way to go would be a really dumb charger that is set up specifically for your battery size. A charger like this will just start as soon as the battery is plugged in.
Lipo charging is pretty simple, you just provide a constant current until it hits a maximum voltage, then the charger reduces the current to the voltage constant.
You could build a simple circuit to do this, but you can also buy basic boards that do it for you. They're cheap and designed to be integrated into electronics projects.
You can monitor the pack voltage and individual cell voltages with an Arduino, Raspberry Pi or other device, depending what you want to do with the data. These all have inputs that are capable of measuring voltages sufficiently accurately to detect imbalances or tell when the battery is charged.

"The exact wiring architecture will differ between flight controllers, but (if the BEC is used at all for board power) it's likely that only one BEC is actively used to power the FC. The others would just be open circuits, i.e. disconnected and unused.
As a general rule in circuit design, it's not a wise idea to combine different power sources/rails unless you use decently complex rail combination circuitry, or if the rails were specifically designed to be combined. This is because any slight voltage differential between the rails will cause current to try to flow between the rails, an undesirable situation because it begins to violate assumed design constraints for both the device and the individual power sources.
It's not that efficient power switching circuitry to change between rails is nontrivial, but it usually just adds often unnecessary complexity (and weight/space) to a board.

",Zenmuse P1 picture quality worse than X7,"I was given two photos flown with the X7 and P1. The purpose of the project is to classify the green vegetation through pixel classification. So pixel value consistency is vital. Especially if I am using the same model. Below I have attached an X7 photo and P1 photo. To me, it is easier to identify the green vegetation with the X7 than it is with the P1. I was informed that the P1 provides higher resolution imagery. So why is it harder to identify the green grass, or for that matter any object? I believe the X7 was using the 24mm lenses and the P1 was with the 35mm. I don't hold much knowledge with camera specs, more in charge of the image processing. Could this be a camera issue or a preprocessing/calibration issue? I've found about zero information online except for the basic specs that Zenmuse has released.
I tossed these into QGIS and picked a few points on the yellow line and found the following results:
X7 R:210-220
X7 G:190-200
X7 B:145-155
P1 R:165-175

"First off, DO NOT power up the quad without a VTX antenna as this can damage the VTX.
And to actually answer your question, it varies. Depending on the quality of the VTX and the power output, you may find you get a decent signal for a small distance, however the signal will be significantly weaker than if you had an antenna and penetration will not be good.
",How far can you get video without a VTX antenna?,"My VTX antenna connector got ripped off the VTX, and I don't know if I fixed it properly or not since the VTX sends video without an antenna plugged in.

"Lower frequency = better penetration*
A 900 or 433MHz control link (DragonLink is the only plug-and-play 433 I know of off-hand) will penetrate quite well, and has impressive range with direct line of sight.
1200MHz (1.2GHz) video systems are available. Standard receiver modules for goggles are also available so that these can be drop-in solutions for existing equipment.
Ground vehicles have the advantage of (hopefully) maintaining a consistent orientation, so antenna placement is much easier. Everything can be done vertically polarized, and at lower frequencies, multipath interference is less of an issue. Linear directional antennas can have very high gains if desired.
*MIMO systems may be able to catch non-Fresnel reflection paths and work with them, however at the expense of latency and with greater processing. Analog video systems are not MIMO, but some digital systems such as DJI likely are. In this case higher frequencies can actually be advantageous as there is more likely a reflected path.

"Flight controllers usually have PPM inputs, not outputs. The PPM output is on your radio module.
You can indeed connect the PPM output signal to both the FC and your PPM-&gt;PWM converter: the FC would be controlling the motors, and the converter would be controlling the servo. There's nothing to configure in Betaflight in this case: the value from a certain channel will be applied directly to the servo.
A better idea is to configure Betaflight to control your servo: this avoids using the converter altogether, saving space, weight an money. If you have 1 or 2 servors to control, it's recommended to use feature SERVO_TILT, otherwise CHANNEL_FORWARDING is an option. Here's the Betaflight documentation page with examples. Note that you need to assign resources (pins with timers) to servos before you can use them.

"What you are asking is not an easy task if you want to design everything on your own. I bet you can try to do it.
First of all there is no way to get a drone airborne  without some sort of stabilising device, since those things are statically and dinamically unstable.
I offer two answers:
1. The long, steep way:
Design your own stabiliser, with a minimum setup of a microcontroller, 4 motors and 4 ESC, one altimeter three gyroscopes and three accelerometers and write your own firmware to control it. starting from scratch, if you may have electronic design and programming skills, I estimate you will invest at least a few months and a few hundred bucks.
2.The easy way
Find a drone that supports Python programming. Using Python you are capable of controlling your drone without a 'proper receiver'. There is a lot to write here but this is maybe space for many other questions.
I would suggest to start programming your drones with simple Python programs, this is a simple example:
from djitellopy import tello
from time import sleep
me = tello.Tello()
me.connect()
print(me.get_battery())
sleep(10)
me.takeoff()
for i in range(5):
    sleep(2)
    me.send_rc_control(0,0,0,90)
    sleep(2)
    me.send_rc_control(0,0,0,0)
sleep(2)
me.send_rc_control(0,0,40,0)
for i in range(5):
    sleep(2)
    me.send_rc_control(0,0,0,90)
    sleep(2)
    me.send_rc_control(0,0,0,0)
sleep(2)
me.land()

Here the drone takes off, climbs and performs a few turns and lands as an example. This way you are programming your own drone without a receiver. Have fun
",Lift off without receiver,"Can I make a small drone frame achieve lift using 4 coreless 3.7 v motors of 55000 rpm, 3.7 v lipo batteries having 40c without a receiver and remote. Motors are all alike. The propellers I have are marked L and R.
Looks like it could rise up. But for some reason it flips over .
I am just trying the basics before I later use a receiver and remote.
Edited and added: Additional things I will try. I will try changing direction of the motors by changing the polarity. I think motor direction is more important than just the propeller L &amp; R. The propellor L and R must be just something that can either reinforce or work against the benefits of Motor direction.
What I understand is if motors spin all in same direction they will cause the whole system to spin over. So what seems best is to have diagonally  opposite corner motors rotate in same direction. Adjacent motors will need to rotate in opposite directions. This I understand is enough for a basic vertical lift.
Let me know. Meanwhile will try later today and update.
Updating: adjusting motor rotation direction helped a bit.
It now lifts on one side while another side drags. It also flips and turns down inverted in one arrangement.
I learnt from some other urls now that the L propellor must go on the CW motor. The R propellor on the CCW motor. I will try that. Also I learnt now that the distance between rotors should be 1/3 of the rotor rotation diameter.
Will work on that next weekend and see.
Post weekend effort: I think problem is with my home made frame. I think the motors are not straight. They are at some angles. Will improve my frame and see.
The other thing I learnt is just try playing with the position of the propellers. As usual diagonally opposite same direction of rotation. Don't assume propeller lettered side should be on top. Depends on manufacturer. Main thing is to keep hand above and below the propellers when all four motors are running and get an idea if it's pushing wind below and not up.
If anyone has any suggestions pls advice.

"I doubt you can grab something off the shelf that can help you with your use case. In any case you will need to put your sensors and payload onboard and set up the logging and data transmission by yourself so it makes sense to DIY stuff to cater to your requirements properly.
For your use case, I think you should look into a 9inch or larger ArduPilot/PX4 Quadcopter/Hexacopter/Octocopter with ExpressLRS 900MHz for reliable control link and a long range FPV setup. Since you don't necessarily require the kind of agility FPV drones require, you can look into DIYing a FPV system based on OpenHD, since while it has high latency, you can make it pretty robust with proper part selection (e.g. multiple good quality Wi-Fi transceivers, high gain directional antennas) and it can display a lot of data over it too. You should ask around in the OpenHD community, they can help you with getting the payload data overlaid on the FPV feed.
You can also use 433MHz Pixhawk Telemetry for data transmission
",What drone or drone kit allows long range {SD FPV and payload data forwarding},"I am looking for a drone which is able to:

has small definition video just for FP navigation

I guess the underlying question boils down to which drone is hackable the easiest.
I have looked around and could not find any which had a clear path to handle an external payload as part of the system, especially for these kind of ranges.
Edit: Apparently the DJI Mavic etc. have Transparent Data Transmission, which looks like it allows us to interface with one of the onboard UARTs for up to 4kB/s which should be enough. But the data is only retrieved on Android - isn't there a more direct way to obtain the data on a Linux PC?

"If you use a BEC you get a few advantages:

Input voltage doesn't matter (usually it has to be at least a few Volts above the output voltage), you can probably use the LiPo you already have.
The servos have constant power, which would otherwise drop off as the voltage get's lower.
If you use the original radio and receiver the range might also drop as the voltage gets lower depending on the exact technology used (Modern receivers usually have their own voltage conversion)

You need to make sure that the BEC can deliver enough current for all you servos and receiver and should also add some margin, to make sure you won't have any brown outs.
Also consider which size battery you need:

It needs to be within voltage range for the BEC
It can probably be relatively small, depending on servo size
Make sure you have a warning beeper or voltage telemetry, so you don't get surprised by an empty battery

"You need DJI goggles to use the DJI air unit (or the Caddx Vista/Runcam Link). The digital stuff is all proprietary.
If you don't want to buy a digital FPV system, I'd recommend going with the cheapest set of box goggles you can find. These are about \$50 with an analogue camera and VTX being about another \$50. It's not a bad idea to start with analogue gear, in case you lose the drone entirely or otherwise damage it.
Box goggles are a bit chunky to transport and wear, but the picture quality is pretty similar to much more expensive goggles. It doesn't really matter how good the screen is when the input signal is low-quality.

"You need a flight controller to stabilize this machine. As you've found, motors are not exactly identical (nor is the air they are pushing, plus many other external factors).
The flight controller uses a gyroscope to detect when there is an abonormality, and compensates by accelerating/decelerating the appropriate motor.
Many flight controllers in this size have an embedded receiver. Often spektrum/frsky but nowadays some are ELRS as well. You will need a matching transmitter that can bind to the flight controller. (The radiomaster tx16s can bind to nearly everything except ELRS, and can even do that with an external module).
A whoop-style flight controller will probably suit you best based on size, power (I assume you're using a single lipo cell), and the fact that the receiver is already built-in. You will still need to solder the motors to the flight controller. Keep in mind this is small soldering and there is risk of short circuits. Test each circuit before powering the board so that you do not damage the motor controller on board.
tl;dr you need a brushed AIO whoop flight controller (AIO - all-in-one means there's a receiver usually) and a transmitter that uses the same protocol.
I've noticed you've been asking a lot of questions to try to get this off the ground. While flight controllers and associated components are expensive, they are essential to flight. You could absolutely make your own flight controller/motor controller without a gyroscope, using an arduino and a half-bridge chip for each motor, however you will find it quite difficult to control without electronic stabilization (and possibly even more expensive to source due to the silicon shortage). The reason for this can be explained by understanding the concepts outlined here:

"The starting point is working out the speed of air through your rotor disk(s). This air starts stationary at some point above the disk, and is pushed down by the disk. The force required to accelerate the air is what lifts a helicopter, and you can modify the usual Force = Mass * Acceleration equation to Force = Mass per second * change in speed to work out the vertical speed of air past the blades.
Note that this approach is independent of blade design, which is why we start with it. It tells you the conditions that you need to design for, based purely on the disk diameter and the required lift.
It also gives you an idea of the top speed, because you can't go faster than the air you're pushing against. (just an idea though, because you're not flying straight up!)
There a more complete guide with equations here
You can also use that change in speed to work out the power required to fly, from the kinetic energy that needs to be supplied every second to the air as it is accelerated to the required speed. It's worth working out the numbers for a few different disk diameters, to compare hovering power (and thus duration) vs top speed.
Most aerofoils stall at around 15 degrees, which sets the limit for the maximum angle of the blades. If you assume they're going to be at that angle, and you have just worked out the vertical air speed, you can multiply by 1/Tan(15) or 3.7 to get the minimum forward speed of the blade.
You can plug that speed into the lift equation for fixed wings to work out the blade area and lift coefficient you need to generated the required lift.
You'll probably find that you don't need anything like 13 blades and a coaxial rotor.
This is really just scratching the surface though. You could do a whole aerospace engineering degree and still not cover everything you have asked for. FWIW, the text book I used was The Foundations of Helicopter Flight by Simon Newman.

Range is how far away the drone can go whereas fly distance is the total distance the drone can fly.  Fly distance is thus 30km (twice 15km) because in order to have a range of 15 km the drone has to be able to go out 15 km and come back 15 km.

From basic reading on the subject (check out these wikipedia pages: 1, 2), it appears that they are relatively synonymous.  It could be that there are slight technical differences (for instance transmitter power appears to refer specifically to the power the transmitter outputs, whereas transmission power seems to figure in the ability of the drone to receive the power as well).

I think you'd probably be better to open a separate question with a bit more detail on exactly what information you're looking for.

"Yes, the rules are pretty much the same in the EU as in the UK :)
Being part of the EU, the flying and operation of drones in Ireland is subject to European Union Regulation 2019/947.
In EU, the UAVs are split in 5 categories (from C0 to C4) based on their mass.
Also, the flights themselves are split in different categories based on their risk level. The three main categories are OPEN, SPECIFIC and CERTIFIED.
The OPEN category (with sub-categories A1, A2 and A3) does not allow any flying over people under any circumstance (no difference made between children/adults, etc). The only 'excpetion' being that for aircrafts less than 250g (C0), flying over uninvolved people is 'tolerated'.
Considering the drone in question weighs more than 250g (wich is more likely, as you commented above), the only way they could fly legally above people within the SPECIFIC category (or CERTIFIED).
Considering the moderate level of risk involved, flights in this category (SPECIFIC) require authorization before the operation. The permission is given by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) considering the mitigation measures identified in an operational risk assessment.
Now remains one question : did they have that authorization ? :)
EDIT: In addition to the authorization, the operator (not necessarily the pilot, more like the manager) needs to be registered and the actual pilot needs an (official) practical skill training and assessment (‘UAS Remote Pilot Competency Certificate’).

"Hmm. I don't recall specifics (been out of rocketry for about 12 years, since shortly after I got into flying electric R/C planes), but I do recall that rocket planes, boost gliders, etc. all have to be launched vertically. Only during the glide phase is a model allowed to assume a horizontal flight profile. NAR and Tripoli probably can provide links to the appropriate legislation.
","In the United States, what are the legal distinctions between a rocket powered RC plane, an actively stabilized model rocket, and a drone?","Model rockets launch and fly autonomously, and can be either actively or passively stabilized. Their powered flight is generally confined to vertical trajectories. Drones fly predominantly horizontal trajectories, autonomously or under operator control, usually use propellers for propulsion, and have weight, flight ceiling, and speed restrictions when piloted recreationally 55 lbs, 400 ft, and 100 mph. Rocket powered RC planes generally fly trajectories including significant horizontal components, under operator control, and can exceed drone speeds (this video).
I am curious as to under what circumstances an aircraft crosses into these various regulatory categories. Specifically, in the video, the rocket powered RC plane crashes because of an early roll that the operator was unable to correct manually. Would integrating active, computer assisted stabilization make the plane a drone? From another angle, there are autonomous quadcopters, and autonomous model aircraft - when do these become drones, and thus subject to the weight, flight ceiling, and speed restrictions?
To provide a unified litmus test for the exact boundaries of these legal classifications, I inquire: Would an autonomous (in the drone sense of the term, meaning able to be brought under operator control), rocket powered model airplane be considered a drone, model rocket, or RC plane, and by which regulations, or combination thereof, would it have to abide?

"I'm not really an expert, but you're right about aft cyclic. A full-size heli is probably cruising along faster than they want to autorotate, and can trade some speed for rotor energy. A model could be doing anything, and once you are autorotating you want to maintain some forward speed so the airflow over the tail helps to keep you straight.
Also, most models are aerobatic and set up with more negative pitch than you need for autorotation. Too much negative pitch will result in a very rapid decent, and could over-speed the rotor. The correct amount is usually about the same as for an inverted hover. It still comes down pretty fast!
Model RPM drops much faster than full-size. There's less momentum in the blades, and much less forward momentum. I think the big difference here is that a full size pilot is probably surprised by an emergency and not used to using negative pitch. They're looking for places to land, trying to restart the engine, and making a mayday call, and need to remember that maintaining RPM is the most important task.
With a model, maintaining RPM is not hard, but it is still the primary task. Listen to the rotor speed and adjust the pitch to keep it about the same as normal. Staying level and steering are secondary.
The hard bit is knowing when and how fast to add positive collective. That's different for each model. You can get used to it by hitting the kill switch from a low hover and trying to stay a few inches above the ground, and by trying to autorotate to a head-height hover and then switching back on.
",Proper procedure for collective-pitch RC helicopter autorotation,"I intend to get a collective-pitch RC helicopter in the future; in the meanwhile I purchased an imitation radio with USB connection and AccuRC to practice in my PC to gain some experience.
I've gone through the training scenarios in AccuRC and I'm getting fairly good at hovers (even inverted) with a variety of 450 to 700 class models. Next, I'm trying to practice autorotations.
A book on flying actual full-size helicopters (&quot;Learning to Fly Helicopters, Second Edition&quot; by R. Randall Padfield) indicates that an autorotation starts with bottom collective -- so far so good -- and aft cyclic. The reasoning for aft cyclic goes that you need to maintain rotor RPM (too low, no lift; too high, you risk structural damage), so you want air flowing through the rotor plane, not in parallel with it. Almost always you'll have forward airspeed so the angle of the wind is such that aft cyclic is required to get airflow through the rotor plane.
I tried to follow the same procedure within AccuRC, but I get the feeling that aft cyclic just causes loss of forward speed and appears to be actually counterproductive.
I understand the physics of full-size helicopters will not be identical to those of RC helicopters due to different scaling factors for weight/area/volume, so perhaps the autorotation procedure in an RC helicopter may be different.
Can someone describe in detail the exact steps for autorotation of an electric, 450 to 700 class, RC helicopter, and what to watch out for? E.g. the book mentioned above emphasizes quite strongly the need to maintain rotor RPM -- is this as much of an issue with RC helicopters as well?

"With aircraft, there are 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) we want to control (roll-pitch-yaw, and x-y-z), but for hovering vehicles (i.e. rotorcraft) we can get away with controlling two degrees of freedom (x-y) by combining the 4 other degrees (roll-pitch-yaw + z).

There are many ways of controlling those four DoF, typically:


helicopters, which use variable pitch blades and some combinations of main and tail rotors, to result in a combination which results in control over roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust
tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc..., all of which use their blades to control the roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust.


Somewhere it is inescapable that for stabilized flight on all four DoF you must have the ability to control each DoF. Mathematically, the quadcopter provides the lowest number of simple actuators that accomplish the job. Each actuator can work by simply speeding up or slowing down, whereas helicopters and tricopters require some other kind of actuation, usually a complex one. It turns out from a pragmatic viewpoint speeding up and slowing down motors is much more robust than changing angles of spinning blades.

Quadcopter

Formally, it looks like this:



So quadcopters reign over helicopters and tripcoters because they're simple. Each axis is controlled by a certain combination of motor speeds and all axes are independent, i.e. when you increase thrust you don't have to also worry about changing the pitch.

So why not hexas, octos, etc...?

Hexacopters

Hexas can lift more, but provide no additional safety margin because there is no way to stabilize all four axes when an arbitrary motor goes out (there are certain configurations which can continue to fly if one motor out of a set of four fails, but cannot fly if either of the other two fail).

Hexas also are less efficient, since they use smaller propellers. (Without diving into blade theory, and simplifying somewhat, the most efficient blade is a single blade which is infinitely large and moving infinitely slowly.)

Hexas also have 6 motors for four degrees of freedom, so when they're all flat you get what is called an ""overconstrained"" system. You can actually angle them to interesting effect, e.g. CyPhy Work's LVL 1 drone.

Octocopters

Octos theoretically can continue to fly if any arbitrary motor fails, but in reality, you'll likely encounter blade stalling effects or other pathologies that will not allow the octo to sustain flight. This happens because the typical octo is loaded past the point where 4 motors can carry it safely. However, certain high-value vehicles, such as those carrying expensive cameras, are octos because it's cheaper to over-spec the octo's batteries and motors than it is to replace a $50k camera.

Octos are also less efficient, for the same reason as hexas.

"Short answer: Yes, this is very much true. The VTX sends out radio-frequency (RF) energy through the antenna connector and pigtail, and if nothing (or the wrong thing) is connected at the other end, all the energy gets reflected back and could damage your VTX (or at least will heat it up dramatically).
Long answer:
At high frequencies a thing called &quot;impedance matching&quot; becomes very important.
Basically, when a radio wave travels through a wire, the wire presents a certain impedance (a more &quot;generalized&quot; form of resistance) to the signal. Whenever the travelling wave encounters a change in this impedance as it goes through the cable, connectors and other hardware (for example, it was 50 ohms before a certain connector and becomes 75 ohms after), part of the wave gets reflected back at that point, and the bigger the mismatch (expressed as a ratio*, which in the example above is 3:2 = 1.5), the bigger the percentage that gets reflected.
But as long as the ratio stays equal to 1, the reflection percentage is zero, and 100% of the signal will reach the destination. This is a perfect match: every portion of the path that the signal must take has exactly the same impedance as the others, thus the whole signal path has the same impedance**.
In the real world nothing is perfectly perfect, but it's easy to get close enough that the slight mismatches don't create any issues.
Any properly designed antenna will have about the same impedance (in the frequency range that it was designed for; for a video antenna that would be 5.7-5.9 GHz) as the coaxial cable connected to it, thus achieving a close-to-perfect match,
so (almost) nothing gets reflected towards the VTX, and the rest of the energy gets happily radiated out in the form of radio waves.
However, If there is nothing at the end of your pigtail, the mismatch is as big as it can possibly be, since nothing connected means infinite resistance and a ratio of ∞:1. Thus all of the power that the VTX emits gets reflected back towards it and has nowhere to go other than to heat up the VTX itself. If the VTX is poorly designed, the reflected power could even burn some of the components in it!
Obviously, this gets more important with the more powerful VTXes. If you've got a 25 mW or even a 200 mW VTX, it's probably not going to damage itself if left without an antenna for a while (although you better not risk it anyway), it'll just get very hot. An 800+ mW VTX could do much more damage; in the best case it will just get extremely hot and burn your hands if you touch it. More likely it'll also burn itself and maybe some other nearby electronics if left on for a while.
If you really need to run without an antenna for some reason (which is rare, but possible if you're testing something that needs the VTX to be powered up, but don't want to actually transmit anything), there is an option to terminate the transmission line with a &quot;dummy load&quot; instead of an antenna. The dummy load  is just a powerful 50-ohm resistor that is impedance-matched to the VTX and connecting cable's 50 ohms, so it eats all the RF power coming from the cable without reflecting any back. The power gets converted into heat (that's what resistors do) which then escapes into the air via a big radiator glued to the resistor. so the dummy load itself will heat up (the power still has to go somewhere), but nothing else will.
Note that shorting the connector is also going to reflect all the power back to the VTX. 1:0 is the same as ∞:1, so zero resistance is no better than infinite resistance.
Also, beware of antennae that are designed for other frequency ranges. For example, a 2.4 GHz antenna from your router or radio control might look like it's compatible and will probably even have the same (SMA or RP-SMA) connector, so it'll fit mechanically just fine, but at 5.8 GHz it will have a drastically different impedance and thus transmit only a small portion of the power it receives, with the rest being – you guessed it! – reflected back and heating up your VTX.

Notes:

(*): for the purpose of determining the amount of reflection it doesn't matter which way the signal is going, so 50 -&gt; 75 (2:3 = 0.66) is equivalent to 75 -&gt; 50 (3:2 = 1.5).
(**): The most popular value for that common impedance is 50 ohms, so you'll see lots of 50-ohm coax cable, 50-ohm connectors, 50-ohm antennae, etc. There are other standards; TV traditionally uses 75-ohm cables and hardware, and some systems use other values.

"A stable system is one where there's a force that pushes the system back towards it's original state when the system is moved from its balance point.

For example, when the driver gets into a car, there's more weight on one side of the car than the other but the car doesn't flip over. The springs on that side of the car compress and push harder on the wheels. The tyres push harder on the ground and the ground pushes back. The extra force from the ground exactly balances the extra weight and (after possibly bouncing for a moment) the car stops moving.

In an unstable system, say a broom balanced vertically, once it moves from the perfect balance point gravity will pull it further away and it accelerates.

For a quadcopter, there is no force that returns it to its original location, holding it horizontal, or even preventing a gradual roll.

Even if the thrust from each motor was exactly the same, and the weight was perfectly balanced, it's very unlikely to be perfectly stationary. If there's even the slight amount of pitch or roll, the angle from horizontal will gradually increase. As the angle increases, the sideways thrust increases and the drone accelerates.

So the roll rate is constant, the angle and acceleration increase linearly, the horizontal speed increases faster as the acceleration builds, and the distance from the starting position increases even faster as the speed builds. To the pilot, it looks like the drone is accelerating away from its original position much like the broom falling over.

To a systems engineer, the rotation of the drone is neutrally stable - there are no forces increasing or decreasing the rotation rate. However the speed and position are unstable - once it starts moving, it accelerates.



I should mention that there are second-order (i.e. relatively minor) forces too. If you had a large fin on top of the drone, aerodynamic drag on the fin would return the drone to upright as the speed builds and limit the maximum speed - in practice this isn't useful as it doesn't return the drone to its original position.

A LiPo battery has three parts: the anode (negative plate), the cathode (positive plate), and electrolyte (sandwiched in between the two plates). Electricity is formed by electrons moving from the cathode to the anode through the electrolyte (which helps the electrons flow).

The electrolyte decomposes over time, which results in the formation of elemental lithium and oxygen. Some of it combines into lithium oxide and sticks to the anode and cathode, but some of the oxygen remains a gas. This gas is what causes the puffiness you see.

"Yaw authority and ease of mixing is generally the answer - since yaw response isn't necessarily the most linear, being able to have N number of motors contribute to yaw in one direction with the same number in reverse is the simplest motor output mixer configuration.

"Swapping any two of the wires connecting a brushless DC motor to its ESC will reverse the direction it spins.

Despite the name BLDC which implies that the motor runs on DC power, each of the three wires (connected to one of the three phases in the motor) is driven by the ESC with a phase-shifted AC waveform. Each wire's waveform is shifted by 120 degrees from the other two.



This offset is what allows the swapping of two wires to reverse the direction of the motor's rotation.

Because nothing special is required to reverse the motor direction, it is also possible to fix this by editing the software configuration, which will do the same thing but in software. e.g. in the BLHELI32SUITE software for ESCs with the BLHELI_32 firmware installed

"Any vehicle yaws (i.e. turns) by having a net torque applied. What's interesting about a quadcopter is not just how it yaws, but how it yaws and doesn't roll, pitch, or climb at the same time.
To understand how this works, we need to briefly look at the math. We'll use a plus configuration, but really any mutirotor configuration works.

The thing to keep in mind is that thrusts and torques are related to propeller speeds. If you speed a propeller up, it's intuitively obvious that it will create more thrust. And likewise, if you spin it faster, you need more torque. So changing motor speeds changes the net forces and torques on the airframe.
(Pedantically, it goes with the square of speed. So if you double the speed you quadruple the thrust and torque. But that's not important to this analysis.)
Here's the high-level driving equation. If you've ever messed around with mixers, you'll notice that the 4x4 matrix in the middle looks really familiar:

What this does is it maps rotor speeds (squared) to torques about the roll, pitch, and yaw axes, as well as the net vertical thrust.
For hover, let's assume all motors are spinning at the same speed, W. So W = w1 = w2 = w3 = w4
Yaw
What happens if we speed up the first and third and slow down the second and fourth by the same (squared) amount dW?
torque_x = 0*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 - dW) + 0*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 0
torque_y = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 - dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + dW) = 0
torque_z = 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 - dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 4*dW
F_z      = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 - dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) = 4*W^2

So the net force doesn't change (all the dW cancel out), and neither do the net rolls and pitches, but voila we have 4*dW worth of torque!

For completeness, here's what happens when you want to change the other axes as well.
Pitch
Let's change the front and back motors by the same (squared) speed, but we'll leave the other two motors alone:
torque_x = 0*(W^2 + 0) + 1*(W^2 - dW) + 0*(W^2 + 0) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 2*dW
torque_y = 1*(W^2 + 0) + 0*(W^2 - dW) - 1*(W^2 + 0) + 0*(W^2 + dW) = 0
torque_z = 1*(W^2 + 0) - 1*(W^2 - dW) + 1*(W^2 + 0) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 0
F_z      = 1*(W^2 + 0) + 1*(W^2 - dW) + 1*(W^2 + 0) + 1*(W^2 + dW) = 4*W^2

Notice that, again, z-thrust stays constant, but this time only a pitching torque appears.
Roll
Let's change the left and right motors by the same (squared) speed, but we'll leave the other two motors alone:
torque_x = 0*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + 0) + 0*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + 0) = 0
torque_y = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + 0) - 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + 0) = 2*dW
torque_z = 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + 0) + 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + 0) = 0
F_z      = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + 0) + 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + 0) = 4*W^2

As always again, z-thrust stays constant, but this time only a rolling torque appears.
Thrust
Finally, what happens if we speed up all four motors by the same (squared) speed?
torque_x = 0*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 0
torque_y = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) + 0*(W^2 + dW) = 0
torque_z = 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) - 1*(W^2 + dW) = 0
F_z      = 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 - dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) + 1*(W^2 + dW) = 4*W^2 + 4*dW

So only in this case do we see an increase in vertical thrust (by 4*dW). Notice how the net torques about each axis cancel out.
",How does a quadcopter yaw?,"I've always wondered how a quadcopter actually yaws, when all propellers are horizontal. I know that two of the motors spins faster, but I don't understand how that generates thrust in the horizontal direction (I assume it has to?) to make the quadcopter turn.

"A serial signal is composed of a series of High and Low electrical signals sent down a wire.  In the standard serial protocol, a high signal is 0 and low is 1.  In an inverted signal this is reversed so that a high is 1 and low is 0.  You might think it makes more sense that low should always be 0 and high be 1 but electronics engineers decided that standard serial protocol should be the former.

To convert a standard serial signal to an inverted signal you run it through an inverter chip (which can be as simple as a single transistor) which will simply change all high signals to low and vice versa.

F3 and F7 chips have inbuilt inverters on their hardware uarts, which enable them to transmit or receive serial signals in any polarity. For some reason, F4's were designed without that feature and thus do not support inverted signals on their uarts.

"TL;DR;

This is a result of I term windup from the PID controller. It's completely expected and normal with props off, and will be fine when you put props on and go fly! Almost everyone new to RC multirotors asks this question on their first build, so don't feel bad!

Detailed Answer

The detailed answer to this question is related to how multirotors maintain stability in flight. Multirotors use a control system called a PID controller. This is a feedback loop control that takes information from the sensors onboard the flight controller and then executes change via the motors based on how the commanded input is different from what it is sensing. For more information check this white paper from the national instruments lab.

To understand this problem, the component of the PID controller we need to examine is the I constant, often referred to as Ki. Essentially this is based on the integral calculation between the sensed value and the setpoint or target value. What this means is that I get stronger the longer there is a difference between the sensed value and the target value. Hence change over time. What you're seeing as the motors slowly spin-up is the buildup of that Ki value getting stronger and stronger as flight controller is trying harder and harder to execute a change that it can sense, but can't impact. No props means no force to execute change, hence the windup.  This is often referred to as I term windup.

Here is an excellent video from Joshua Bardwell on the topic: 
",Why do the motors on my drone keep spinning up and max out when I run up the throttle on my radio on the bench?,"When I test my drone for the first time and I run the throttle up form my remote with the props off the motors keep spinning even when I bring my throttle back down.

"Aircraft do not scale linearly, for a number of reasons.

Most aerodynamic equations include a speed squared term. If you halve the speed, you only get a quarter of the lift and drag, so models tend to be lighter and less powerful than you'd expect.

If you make a plane with half the wing span, it only has a quarter of the wing area. So now a half size model flying at half speed only has one sixteenth of the lift.

Reynolds number - air flowing over a surface will start with laminar flow but turn turbulent after a while, depending on the speed (and density and viscosity but we can ignore those). A smaller, slower model will see more laminar flow than the full size aircraft. In practice, this is a relatively small effect compared to the previous factors but it's an important consideration for high performance models.


Example
A full size Spitfire had a wing span of 36 ft 10 in (11.23 m), a weight of 5-6000lbs (2-3,000kg) and between 1000hp and 2000hp depending on the variant, with a maximum speed of around 400mph.
If you scaled it linearly, a 1/10th scale model would have a 1.1m span, weigh 200kg, have 100hp and fly at 40mph!
If (as Phil suggests) you scale weight and power by 1000 (10 cubed) it would weigh 5-6lbs and have 1-2hp, which is close but still heavier and more powerful than real models:
A 72&quot; model (1/6th scale) might weigh 15lbs and have 2.5-3KW (4hp) and fly at 100mph.
A 44&quot; model (1/10th scale) might weigh 2-3lb and have 2-300W (1/2hp) and fly at 60mph.
A 36&quot; model (1/12th scale) might weigh about 1lb and have 100W (1/7th hp) and fly at 50mph

"I can't speak for your specific drone, but I have experience with electronics and cold weather.

I would definitely store the batteries in the warm, and check the manufacturer's guidelines for the correct storage voltage (for a LiPo I think this is about 30% to 40% charge, or 3.85 volts per cell) It also doesn't hurt to store them in a fireproof container for extra safety.

The main hazard I've found when storing and operating electronics in freezing conditions is the risk of freeze-thaw cycles when the temperature is hovering around 0°C. Once it is cold, it's generally OK.

Additionally, if you do decide to use the aircraft during the winter take care when moving it from a cold, dry environment into a warm one - condensation will form and can cause damage or corrosion. Let it warm up thoroughly before use - if possible, seal it into a watertight bag or box before bringing it in to preserve the dry air around the drone, and wait for it to warm up before opening to minimise condensation.

"It sounds like you've encountered what's called ""vortex ring state"", when a rotorcraft descends into its own wake -- essentially, a self-created downdraft.

There are two ways to escape from such a situation:


Power out of it.  Climbing out of the craft's wake vortex requires about twice as much power as hovering, so while most full-sized helicopters can't do this, most quadcopters and other small-scale craft can.
Move forwards (or backward, or sideways) out of the craft's wake.  This is the standard procedure for helicopters.


You can also avoid it entirely by not descending too fast, or by not descending straight down.

"Ok, so this could turn into a very long answer! 

The short version is, Kv stands for the velocity constant, and it has to do with the rotational velocity it takes to generate one volt of back EMF. Contrary to a lot of popular belief, it actually isn't a direct measurement of the RPMs at any given input voltage. There is an ancillary relationship between the velocity constant and the forward voltage relationship to RPMs, but there are a lot of other factors, such as bell rotational inertia (and anything else being driven), friction, and drive mechanics in the ESC that can impact the RPMs when the motor is actively being driven.  

That being said, the no-load RPMs per volt is a decent estimate of Kv if you aren't concerned with being extremely accurate. If you're always using the same ESC and power supply, to drive the motor it can still be a reliable comparative metric between specific motors, even if it might have some offset to the actual electrical Kv of the motor when measured via back EMF. For a thorough discussion on the different methods of measuring Kv, check out this article on Bavaria-Direct.

Also, it needs to be pointed out that the torque and Kv don't have the relationship you might think. You can read a full article on the details over at miniquadtestbench, but essentially the torque constant or Kt which is directly proportional to the velocity constant (Kv) has to do with how much current a motor draws to produce torque, not how much torque a motor is capable of producing. This is a super important distinction. The torque the motor is capable of producing is defined by the internal resistance and the magnetic field strength at the stator. The field strength is defined by things like magnet strength rating (field density) thickness, and width/height, as well as the air-gap between the magnets and the stators (remember the inverse square law). The winding resistance is defined by the length and gauge of the wire used, as well as the number of strands. Assuming we can create a winding of equal resistance at different Kv by tweaking the gauge wire or the number of strands used, we would have equal torque capacity on both motors, only the torque would cost more current to produce on higher Kv motor. 

The reason why there is a belief that high Kv motors produce less torque than low Kv motors is that the maximum torque output is limited by the maximum output rating defined by the heat dissipation capacity of the motor, and usually listed in the manufacturer specifications as a wattage limit. Essentially the higher Kv motor will burn out sooner than the lower Kv motor as the torque load increases at maximum output.  However given a load that is within the power limits of both motors, a lower Kv motor will not produce better results (faster RPM changes or better handling of a given prop for instance) than a higher Kv motor with equivalent magnetic field strength and winding resistance. Also, throttle limiting the higher Kv motor to equivalent RPMs as the lower Kv motor will produce extremely similar results, albeit with higher current spikes on rapid transitions where the difference in Kt shows itself on higher torque demand.

"The Mode of a transmitter refers to which stick on the transmitter controls which movement on a drone. There are 4 modes (named Mode 1 to 4) but the most common are Mode 1 and Mode 2.

The image below shows which control is associated with which aircraft axis, for each mode. The black text refers to fixed-wing aircraft and the blue text is the multirotor equivalent.



Mode 1 and 2 are the most common flight modes used.  Most multirotor pilots fly mode 2 (although there are exceptions, one of the OG FPV pilots FinalGlideAus notably flew mode 1).  Almost all ""toy"" multirotors are Mode 2.  In fixed-wing RC mode 2 is very common in the US, while Mode 1 is popular elsewhere.

Having a more knowledgeable pilot being able to fly your drone, or being able to watch their fingers and see how they're doing a particular trick, or for them to be able to coach you easily is enormously beneficial.

"This is going to be a long answer but bear with me.
First, I must discuss the phenomenon of polarization itself. As you probably know, radio waves are a subtype of electromagnetic waves, which in turn are nothing more than alternating electrical and magnetic fields in space. The laws of this universe dictate that a changing electric field creates a (perpendicular) magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field will create an (also perpendicular) electric field. This allows the two fields to feed on each other.
Now, the most common picture of an EM wave that you have probably seen is something like this:

This is a linearly polarized wave.
Here, the electric field is red and the magnetic field is blue. Each of those always oscillates in a particular direction (e.g. the electric field vertically and the magnetic horizontally). This kind of wave is typically generated with straight antennae, in which electrons move back and forth along the antenna and thus generate the linearly-oscillating electric field. The wave on the picture is vertically polarized (The polarization direction is the electric field's orientation) and was probably generated by a vertically oriented antenna.
While an antenna only generates waves of its corresponding polarization, it can receive differently polarized waves, as long as the electrons inside the antenna can move in the same direction that the electric field of the wave is oscillating.
For example, an antenna oriented at 45° relative to the incoming wave's polarization, will still receive the signal, as it is still oscillating somewhat in the same direction, just (1.41 times) weaker: the electrons in the antenna can still be moved up and down by the wave, as long as they're also moving side to side so that they could stay within the antenna. In fact, the only situation in which such an antenna will reject (not receive) a signal entirely is if the antenna is perpendicular to the polarization direction: electrons can't move vertically in a horizontal antenna at all. In all the other antenna positions will have varying strengths of reception (or gains) depending on how much the directions differ (in mathematical terms, it's proportional to the inner product of the two directions).
The other main type of polarization is circular polarization, in which the electric field does not just oscillate in one direction, but instead rotates around an axis (along which the wave travels), with the magnetic field following, forming a spiral as it propagates through space. A circularly-polarized signal can be thought of as a sum of two perpendicular linearly-polarized ones, one lagging a bit behind the other:

(note that the red and blue colors do not mean electric and magnetic fields here, this is the same field viewed from two directions.)
(for completeness, there is also elliptical polarization, which can be thought of as a sum of a circular and linear signal, or a sum of two linear signals that are not equally strong).
Any rotation must have a direction (or handedness), clockwise or counterclockwise, relative to the direction in which the wave is traveling. That is what distinguishes Right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) waves from Left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) ones. There are antennae specifically designed to emit and receive circularly-polarized waves, and they, too, must have one of the two possible directions. An RHCP antenna emits RHCP waves, and the same is true for LHCP.
Reception is more complicated. A linear antenna would receive circularly-polarized signals no problem, in any orientation (except if pointed directly at the signal's source), since, as we discussed, exactly half of that signal's power is linearly polarized in the antenna's direction (and the other half perpendicularly, so that part is rejected, hence the gain is 1/2 or lower). The opposite is also true: a circularly-polarized antenna of either handedness will happily receive (though at no more than half gain) any linearly polarized signal (which is half of a circularly polarized one).
The one kind of signal a circularly polarized antenna will reject is a signal of the opposite handedness. an RHCP antenna will refuse to receive an LHCP signal, and vice-versa. And that is the main reason why these antennae are used in FPV.
The bane of video signals in industrial and other environments rich in RF-reflecting surfaces is multipath propagation, or multipathing, as it's more commonly known. This is a situation in which the transmitted signal, besides a direct line of sight path, gets received via reflections from nearby surfaces. Since the reflected signal takes a longer path, it gets to your goggles a bit later than the direct signal. This delay is enough for the very fast scan rate of analog video to go forward several pixels, so overlaying this delayed signal (of which there are usually several) on top of the original one produces severe distortions in the image, even though the reflected signal tends to be weaker than the original.
The good thing for us about reflected signals, however, is that a circularly polarized wave reverses its handedness whenever it bounces off of something, so a reflected RHCP wave becomes LHCP and vice versa (as the direction of travel changes, while the direction of rotation stays the same), which means that the antenna will reject all reflections. It will not reject double reflections, which will have the original polarization, but those are even weaker than single ones, so the interference from those is much smaller.
Another bonus is that it allows sharing bandwidth better if pilots on close channels fly opposite-handed signals, as possible interference from the neighboring band will be rejected by one's receiving antenna.
As far as the difference between RHCP vs LHCP goes, as you can see, neither is better than the other physically, they are two sides of the same coin.
However, in actual practice there are differences if you don't fly alone. Historically, RHCP has been several times more common than LHCP, and that means two things:

With an RHCP antenna, you can spectate almost anyone, and they can spectate you, while with an LHCP antenna it's far less likely both ways (although one can spectate both kinds of circular polarization with a linear antenna and face the multipathing).
It's easier to get interference from others (and cause interference to them) if you're flying the same polarization, so RHCP is going to be generally noisier and more interference-prone for everyone around.

If you're not racing, the second point probably doesn't matter, just move a couple of channels away. If you are, you should probably have both RHCP and LHCP antennae with you and be ready to switch as directed by the organizers.
Still, even if you're not a racer, it can be worth having a couple of LHCP antennae in your flight bag for when a lot of people are in the air; you'll get a much cleaner signal that way (and they will, too)!
Some receiving antennae, such as the Triple-feed patch, can be either RHCP or LHCP depending on where you attach the feedline. Those can be worth having if you can't decide or switch polarizations often, or just to reduce the number of antennae to own.

"Brushless motors (aka BLDC) are typically[*] more efficient than brushed DC motors. Higher efficiency equates to longer flight times for a same battery pack.

Amongst other reasons:


The inrush current at the moment of commutation can involve sparks (which is an inefficient waste of energy), and in any case is a free-running operation without the possibility for optimization.
The carbon brushes have a somewhat higher resistance, which is an electrical energy loss
The carbon brushes involve a certain amount of drag, which is a mechanical energy loss
The EM field is not easily controllable to reduce torque ripples, resulting in mechanical energy losses. Anecdotally, you can hear these ripples, especially when comparing power tools using universal motors (i.e. brushed AC wound in series) vs BLDC. Sounds represents energy, all other things being equal a noisier drive is a less efficient drive.


Brushless motors also are easily built into outrunner applications, which is appropriate for high-torque direct drive applications, such as a propeller. An inrunner needs an inefficient gearbox to develop the torque required to spin a blade (which might also be complex, costly, and weighty).

An oftentimes overlooked consequence of brushless efficiency is heat generation. Fundamentally, what limits a motor's power is heat, and producing less of it means that more energy can be supplied from a smaller package. The smaller package means lighter weight, which equates to longer-runtime.

Each of these on its own is small, but summed together they result in a far superior drone operation from brushless than brushed.

[*] There are some extremely efficient (>95%) brushed motors out there. However, the engineering required to get that high efficiency is costly. Cheap mass-produced brushed motors will never have those kinds of tolerances, but brushless motors are much less sensitive to manufacturing imprecision.

"To clarify, the 48kHz is NOT running on the gyroscope or the FC firmware.
What 48kHz is referring to is the PWM Frequency in the ESC, namely the frequency at which the power MOSFETs on the speed controller switch on and off in order to provide power to the brushless motors and therefore thrust to the craft.
The reason in whoops and small/light craft 3"" and smaller will see a flight time improvement is that the RPm ranges these crafts fly at, the switching down-time at lower PWM frequencies means the motor/ESC is having very small active braking events in the switching cycle, then overcompensating by driving higher throttle values to compensate (both of which cost energy).

"The compatibility of mixed polarity antennae depends greatly. For a little background in RF polarity, this diagram shows the difference between the four main types of antenna polarization available: (mixed/elliptical polarization do exist)

 (cit.)

In general, it is best if the TX and RX antennae match in polarization, but some other combinations are possible while minimizing signal strength loss.

Linear → Linear

Linearly polarized antennae are interchangeable, as long as they are oriented in the same direction. Signal reception between linearly polarized antennae oriented with an angle between them of θ will fall off with a polarization loss factor (PLF) of PLF = cos^2 (θ) and reception will be zero when the antennae are perpendicular to one another.

Circular → Circular

As long as the circular polarization is identical (RHCP or LHCP) between the two antennae, no signal loss will be observed due to the polarization of the antennae. Signal strength isn't dependent on the angle between the orientations of the circularly polarized antennae. However, if you aren't using omnidirectional antennae (e.g. mushroom)¹ and instead have a directional antenna (e.g. patch, helical), you must point the directional antenna in the direction of the other antenna to have the most gain. (see ""What is antenna gain?""). Within the beam width of the directional ciruclarly polarized antenna, orientation doesn't matter.

As pointed out by @FlashCactus, only circular → circular polarization matches benefit from the multipath interference reduction effect. This is because circularly polarized waves switch polarization when they bounce off of an obstruction (i.e. RHCP → LHCP and vice versa), so duplicate signals taking an odd number of bounces to reach the receiver will be ignored by the antenna. (they will be recieved as the opposite polarization with which they were transmitted)

For more details on how circular polarization works, I (and @FlashCactus) recommend having a look at this question: What is circular polarization in antennas?

¹: Omnidirectional antennae are also not truly omnidirectional; they have a region of low gain along their axis, and will transmit/receive poorly in that direction. It is best to face them sideways towards the other antenna for best reception. The same is true for linear antennae; they receive&amp;transmit best from their sides and worst along the antenna.

Circular → Linear

Because a circularly polarized wave can also be represented by two 90° out-of-phase perpendicular linearly polarized waves, the linear antenna will receive with a signal strength reduction (PLF) of half (or -3dB). Signal strength isn't dependent on the angle between the orientations of the linearly polarized and circularly polarized antenna.

This configuration can be useful if you want to spectate someone who has the opposite transmitting antenna handedness from you (LHCP while you use RHCP, for example), or to scan the radio spectrum that might contain signals of different polarization (RHCP, LHCP or linear) without switching the antenna: A linear antenna will receive both RHCP and LHCP signals equally well.

Linear → Circular

Likewise from before, because the circularly polarized antenna is built to receive both perpendicular components of the circularly polarized wave, it will receive a linearly polarized wave with a signal strength reduction (PLF) of half (-3dB). Signal strength isn't dependent on the angle between the orientations of the linearly polarized and circularly polarized antenna. As with the opposite configuration, RHCP and LHCP antennae will receive linearly polarized signals equally well.

This configuration can be commonly seen in the case of micro-quads like Tinywhoops which only come with linearly polarized transmitter antennae. Here, the orientation-agnostic benefits of receiving a linearly polarized signal with a circularly polarized antenna (and the convenience of not replacing the antennae on your goggles) are often worth the signal strength reduction.
",Can circularly and linearly polarized antennae be used together for FPV?,"I have a few spare antennae of mixed polarizations I'd like to be able to reuse for my FPV gear.

"Charging Lithium batteries is a far more delicate process than discharging them because of the complex chemical processes involved. Batteries that are rated for tens of ""c""s of discharge rate are usually only rated for 1-2 ""c""s of charging rate. Standard charging rates are 1c for regular speed and 2c for fast charging, with 2c damaging the battery more.

C-ratings are an artificial marketing term that doesn't really help very much without being converted using this formula: Charging Current (amps) = C-rating * Battery Capacity (amp-hours) where one amp-hour (Ah) is equal to 1000 milli-amp-hours (mAh).

So, for example:


1500 mAh battery charging @ 1c = 1.5 A charging current
2000 mAh battery charging @ 1c = 2.0 A charging current
2000 mAh battery charging @ 2c = 4.0 A charging current
2000 mAh battery charging @ 0.5c = 1.0 A charging current


Charging at higher currents (higher c-ratings) is more damaging to the battery's cells and is more likely to cause complications like fires and explosions while charging. The opposite is true for charging at lower currents. It is hardly ever recommended to charge at more than 2c, and staying as close as possible to 1c is always recommended for safety and battery longevity.

"There is a CAA run scheme to help return lost drones to their owners called ‘drones reunited’, however you have to have registered your drone with the CAA to use it. If you have, then you may find their website helpful.

There are also other ways in which you can try to locate your drone:

Firstly, have a look around the Facebook groups local to your area in case anyone has posted about it, and if they haven’t then you can put out a post asking if anyone has found it.

You can also put up posters offering a reward if someone finds your drone and returns it to you (assuming you get the appropriate permissions).

There are also several lost and found schemes across the UK, one of which is the Metropolitan Police Lost and Found scheme.

If this is the S49 you posted about, it may have flown for a few minutes after it started to fly away (assuming you had already run down the battery a bit). You can look on Google Maps and form a search pattern to cover the area around where you lost your quad - if you can remember the direction it flew then that is especially helpful.

Finally, try to learn from the flyaway to make sure it never happens again. Many environmental factors, such as power lines, can disrupt your control of the aircraft, so always scout where you are going to fly to make sure it is safe to do so. I also put my contact details and the phrase ‘reward if found’ on my drone so if it is lost, the finder can easily contact me to return it.

"Autonomous operation isn't a technical problem.  For example, DJI's drones are capable of flying themselves back to the launch point if the signal from the remote control fails.
The problem is legality.
Most drones are required to be flown within the operator's line of sight.  The reason for this isn't because the operator has to be actively controlling the drone -- a fully-autonomous drone is perfectly legal -- but because the operator is responsible for collision avoidance.
If you've got an operator watching things, ready to take over if a problem arises, a self-piloting drone is perfectly legal.  If, on the other hand, you want something that's completely unattended, you'll need to work with your local regulatory agency to get permission, and that's going to be a difficult thing to do.

Once you know what you can legally do, the first stage is to set up a failsafe. Do this by setting failsafe conditions in your radio and in whatever firmware your quad uses. Choose what you want the quad to do during a failsafe, whether it should drop out of the sky or slowly lower.

You can also install GPS and set the failsafe as a return to home, and depending on your firmware there are different ways of doing this.

Another way to make sure you stay in the range is to set up RSSI or LQ depending on your system. This tells you how strong the signal is so you can monitor it.

"SBUS and IBUS are both digital protocols and for a digital protocol, you define two voltage values to represent an active state and one inactive state. This is done for every digital protocol.

You can specify that 0V is inactive and 1V is active (this is called active high). But you can also define that 0V is active and 1V is inactive (active low).

Many bus protocols are active low and SBUS is also such a protocol. The reason for this choice is that active low signals can handle noise better. This is probably the reason why Futaba designed SBUS this way.

The ARM chips used on the flight controllers have the hardware to decode serial signals (both SUBS and IBUS are serial protocols). This decoder also is built for active high or active low signals. If you want to decode an active low signal (SUBS) with a decoder that is built for active high you have to add an inverter between so that both ""talk the same language"". This is the case for the F4 chips since ARM did not include an inverter on the chip. For F3/F7 this problem does not exist since ARM included the inverter in the chip and the software can enable/disable the inverter.

You get similar performance from SBUS and IBUS since both are a serial protocol with comparable frame times.

"To answer this question, there are two things you need to know.  First you need to be able to map the various channels and bands to their frequencies.  Second, you need to understand Intermodulation Distortion (IMD).  The quick explination of IMD is that two or more radio frequencies can combine to cause interference on a third frequency.



Using the above chart you can see how the different bands and channels overlap.  In general, when flying with just one other person, you are fine to choose any two channels that don't overlap frequencies.  However as you add more people to the mix, you have a higher chance of causing IMD.  To help with that issue, many races now operate using a group of channels called IMD5 or IMD6.

If you are in a group of 5 people, the recommendation is to use R1, R2, F2, F4, and E5.  If you are in a group of 6 people, use R1, R2, F2, F4, F8, and R8.

"Yes, you actually can! There are a couple of options for the Betaflight firmware which are mostly plug and play.

OpenTX Lua Scripts

Radios running OpenTX can use scripts written in Lua to control these parameters with the radio's scroll wheel and buttons. Please see @PaulKendall's answer for an explanation of how this method works.

Betaflight OSD

If you have an FPV setup on your quad, you can make use of the Betaflight OSD to tweak the vast majority of settings you would need access to during a flight session, like the PID values and rate profiles you mentioned. The OSD makes use of the sticks on your transmitter to navigate the menus, which appear as an overlay on top of the camera feed from the quad.

As described in this article by Oscar Liang, the stick combination mid throttle, yaw left, pitch forward, roll centered is used to enter the menu, which should look something like this:



From here, pitch up/down is used to navigate up and down in the current menu, and roll right to select an option or enter a sub-menu. (items with arrows on the right side are sub-menus) The roll axis is used to change a value up/down.

I know this sounds confusing, but it makes a lot more sense once you try it out and gain experience working with it. Remember to select the SAVE REBOOT after making a change and before going back to flying, or your change likely won't take effect! 

Speedy Bee Smartphone App

If you want an experience that is closest to using the desktop Betaflight configurator or don't have an FPV setup on your quad to use, the Speedy Bee smartphone app for iOS and Android may be a good option. You can connect to the quad either using Bluetooth (you must have a Bluetooth module already installed on your quad), or over USB (USB OTG mode is only supported on Android).



Because this app is developed and maintained by a third-party and not the Betaflight project, some new settings aren't likely to be accessible with this app, but it should work for most common settings. I suggest watching Joshua Bardwell's video about this app for more details.

"Overview

The most efficient propeller is single bladed, has infinitely narrow chord, has infinitely thin airfoil, has an infinitely long blade, spins infinitely slowly, and requires infinite torque. So at the risk of stating the obvious, propeller design is a study of the tradeoffs and compromises required to make something practical. Here's a list of some compromises:


length: landing gear height (or water depth) restricts how long a blade can be. 
material constraints: thicker airfoils resist forces better. Stronger materials allow for thinner airfoils while still meeting required blade strength
power-plant constraints: the torque required to spin the propeller should match the motor/engine's efficiency and power curves.
number of blades: more blades equal more thrust for a same diameter
increased activity factor (aka blade width): wider blades produce more thrust for the same diameter
balancing: one prop is very hard to balance without causing lots of drag by the opposing mass.
vibration: three props give fewer vibrations than two
sound pollution: smaller props spinning more slowly are more pleasing on the ear
consumer perception: consumers like to see big blades in their fans, regardless of real-world efficiency and performance.
density of the fluid: 


dense fluids such as water can cause cavitation, which can quickly  damage the propeller. One solution is to change tip shape so as to minimize cavitation likelihood.
on the opposite scale, with low-density fluids such as air, the blade tip can spin so quickly it stalls.



As it relates to drones

Rotorcraft are a little special, so let's break out by type:

Vertical propulsion

Multirotor drones and helicopters have tons of space compared to boats, and so don't particularly need to restrict their diameter. They choose their rotors based primarily on power-plant performance.

Longitudinal propulsion

Fixed-wing drones with landing gear obey the same rules as full-scale aircraft. If  the prop is going to hit the ground on takeoff it's not very useful!

Fixed-wing drones without landing gear, e.g. hand-launch gliders, can use very large folding propellers. These are chosen similarly to multirotors, where it's about efficient power-plant matching.

As pointed out by @RobinBennett, ""You don't want it stalled when the aircraft is stationary, so there's a maximum pitch angle - and that sets the maximum speed. If you want to go faster you need to spin the prop faster, and if you've got a fixed amount of power, you need a smaller prop just to spin it faster.""
",Why do drone propellers have blades with thin chords?,"Almost all propellers used for drones have very thin chord length compared to the propellers used for things like table fans or boats which seem to have blades with much longer chord length.

"There are two considerations on whether you can fly somewhere - airspace restrictions and land restrictions.

Details on the airspace can be acquired from a number of common sources - the CAA has a page with lots of in-depth information here1, but there are a lot of third-party websites and applications which present information in a more accessible format (for example, I personally use Drone Safety Map and the NATS Drone Assist app.) Remember to check for NOTAMS, although many websites and apps provide this functionality too.

Land restrictions are not so neatly centralised, so you will need to manually investigate whether your local authority or playing field owners have any restrictions for flying drones from their land. As drone use has increased in recent years, larger numbers of public spaces are making this information available on websites or signs but in many cases, you will need to find out who is the owner and contact them directly for permission.

"This is a huge question, which is why a complete answer is not really possible without specifics on your drone frame, antennas, antenna placement etc.

Long story short - Carbon Fibre is pretty much opaque to 2.4GHz radio waves. It's not interference, as such, it just blocks it, which is why guidance is always given to ensure your antenna placement is such that the frame is not between them and you in normal flight. 

For a camera platform drone, like an Inspire, you can be confident of the orientation of the drone so the antennas will always have line of sight to you, but for a racing drone you need to make decisions based on ""least obscured"" placement, as well as robustness, which is why they are typically in the plane of the frame (but not attached along frame members) or well above the frame.

"It should be possible so long as the aircraft has enough spare thrust and lift to counteract the drag and weight. Many model aircraft have good power-to-weight compared to their full size equivalent.


For the banner attachment, you need a secure point to attach it to the aircraft, well away from any propellers or control surfaces. Usually this is on the bottom rear of the fuselage.
It is a good idea to include a 'weak link', which will break if the banner snags; this leaves the banner behind, but saves the aircraft being pulled from the sky.
You will also need to weight the banner to hang in the correct orientation - making the vertical part of the banner support bottom heavy should suffice.

"At least at the small/model scale, the answer is no. There is significant efficiency loss due to the stacked propellers not receiving the same clean air as they would if they were horizontally separated.

This is demonstrated experimentally in a Youtube video by rctestflight which compares the efficiency/thrust production of three different propeller configurations sharing the same propeller type and motor type:


Coaxial — What you're talking about where two props are stacked vertically so that they share the same rotational axis.
Overlapping — Where two props' discs overlap each other by roughly half a prop diameter
Normal — Where two props are positioned side-by-side without any overlap




To quote Daniel from rctestflight in his video:


  Any prop overlap is significant in efficiency loss. Traditional side-by-side
  motors are 25% more efficient than coaxial and 8.4% more efficient
  than overlapping props.
  
  To me, losing 25% efficiency is not worth the small form-factor and increased ease of transportability that a coaxial system produces.

"There's no magic technology, it's just a difference in design goals. FPV drones are designed for speed, performance and robustness, DJI drones are designed for duration and carrying a gimbled camera.
Larger, slower turning rotors are more efficient at producing lift but have a lower top speed. That's why helicopters can hover and propeller planes with the same size engine can't - but the plane is faster. Photography drones (such as DJI) use large rotors and exploit that efficiency for duration. Race drones use smaller rotors because they want to go as fast as possible.
The other factor is that photography drones typically carry larger batteries for longer duration, while race drones want to keep their weight down for maximum agility and acceleration. A photography drone will fly so long as it can produce more thrust than its weight, typically they have less than a 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and can't maintain altitude when angled more than 45 degrees from horizontal. Race drones can have a 10:1 thrust to weight ratio, and commonly fly at pretty extreme angles.
So long as a race drone has enough duration to complete the race, any extra battery capacity is just dead weight, slowing it down. For their pilots, changing the battery every few minutes is a small price to pay for the performance.

The flight characteristics of these two crafts are quite different. A DJI drone is flown at much slower speeds than FPV drones So, if a FPV drone was flown slowly and cautiously, would the battery extend to be comparable with DJI's?

I have read elsewhere that the energy cost of FPV drones is due to the small blades, the motor needs to spin faster to compensate. This would imply that if you increased the blades (and the arm length) you would get longer flight times...?

"Probably the easiest way to get started building planes these days is with foam board models, such as those popularised by FliteTest. Foam board is a 5mm thick non-beaded polystyrene foam sheet with a layer of paper on either side for added strength. You can buy sheets from craft stores for a dollar or two.  It's easy to cut with a sharp knife (small box cutters are ideal) and it can be glued with hot glue or UHU POR (but some other adhesives will melt the foam). The paper layer makes it easy to paint, with almost any paint.
You can build a good starter plane with two or three sheets of foam, and with practice it only takes an afternoon or so. Your first attempt may be a bit scruffy but you will get better with practice, so plan to make several. Smallish, light models are fairly tough and easy to patch up, but knowing you can completely rebuild for very little cost is a huge confidence boost and will help avoid the common story of buying an expensive model from a shop, crashing on your first flight and giving up.
Download and print out a 3-view drawing of your favourite plane and stick it to the foam. Cut out a profile of the fuselage, and the plan view of the wings and tail. Stick them together, add some nose weight so it balances about 25% from the front of the wing and it will probably fly. Experiment with the nose weight, the angle of the tail and dihedral. You'll also learn a lot about the location and weather required for flying.
Next find a plan for a beginner RC plane in foam board, such as the FliteTest Tiny Trainer, Simple Cub or Scout. These models are relatively light and simple, and all have the wings angled up (called dihedral) which causes them to self-level, vastly increasing your chances of success.
These all have free plans under the 'resources' tab in their shop. Print them out, lightly glue the paper to the board and cut them out. Feel free to simplify the shapes slightly as they were drawn for a laser cutter.
Now for the electronics. There are some toy planes under $20 that are quite fun for a 10-year old under adult supervision but they're quite limited and not a good way to start the hobby. You don't have much control and they're very slow, so will blow down wind. You also can't reuse the gear in anything else so they're not a good investment.
A basic radio will cost at least \$30, but you'll want to upgrade that within a year so it's not really a good investment. For \$40 you can get a cheap computer radio with multiple model memories (for when you have more than one plane) and channel mixes (for flying wings, deltas, V-tails or flaps) - that's all the features you really need for a lifetime in the hobby. Most people will spend more for a 'nice' transmitter, but you don't need to. Transmitters generally come with a receiver.
The recommended sizes for the various bits are listed with the plans. You'll need to do a bit of research to work out what all the numbers mean.
Next you'll need a motor and Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). These are \$5-10 each.  You will break props, so get some spares.
9 gram servos are about \$3 each. You'll need 2 initially, but it's worth having a couple of spares for crashes or more complex models.
You'll need multiple batteries, as flights are typically 10 minutes or so.
Basic chargers start at about \$20. Get one that can handle a range of sizes and cell counts, and it'll last you for years.
You won't get that lot for \$50 but you should manage to keep it under \$100. I suppose the stuff that's in the plane should be under \$50, as the expensive bits are the transmitter, charger and spare batteries!
The good news is that the gear can be used on multiple models. When one gets too damaged, or you want to try something new, just move the gear across. The transmitter, charger and batteries can all be shared between multiple models.
It's worth shopping around a bit but avoid anything that's super cheap with no reviews.

"The short answer is that you don't want to run batteries below 3.0V ever, and ideally want to avoid large current draw below 3.5V. For a 3S battery, once you start seeing voltages in single digits (3.33V/cell is 10V, below that), it's time to land as a quick reference point - although you can set more precise values of around 10.6V as the warning point through telemetry at a transmitter and/or OSD on an FPV display.

The real issue you're trying to avoid here is that in the Lithium-CobaltOxide (LiPO battery chemistry), below 3.0 volts (can be 2.8V or so in Li-Ion batteries), the battery starts plating lithium permanently onto the anode reducing the capacity and discharge performance of the pack.  Doing this greatly harms the battery, so avoid that at all costs.

The reason I reference the 3.5V point is that typically you have another 10% of battery capacity left in order to affect a safe landing approach pattern without being under time pressure to land quickly, and make a good safe landing - also under load, the battery that is at 3.5V in flight will tend to recover to 3.7-3.85V depending on craft and setup, which is more appropriate for storing a battery as you travel back home to the bench charge the battery to its proper storage voltage (3.8V).

"So FPV and LOS are ways to fly the drone, with FPV being First Person View and LOS being Line Of Sight.

In FPV, one generally has a fixed camera on the aircraft and controls the aircraft’s movements based on what they see on the screen/goggles. This is analogous to VR, however not exactly the same.

LOS, however, means watching the aircraft from a third-person perspective, for example how you would watch a bird fly. 

Both of these methods have their advantages and disadvantages, however many people in the hobby find FPV more exciting (though not everyone).

Angle and Acro, on the other hand, are the flight modes.

In Angle, when the sticks return to zero deflection, the quad will self-level, so the entirety of its thrust is vectored down - there will be no acceleration in any given direction (part from vertically based on the throttle). In Angle mode, the drone is not able to tilt beyond a caretaking angle, so flipping, rolling, etc is not allowed.

However, in Acro, the drone has no angle limits so it can roll and even hang upside down with sufficient momentum. The drone will also maintain the same attitude once the sticks return to zero deflection, so needs to be manually leveled.

There is a combination of these two modes called Horizon, in which the drone behaves as if it is in Angle mode during normal flight, however it is still able to flip and roll.

"In theory, you can't accelerate and decelerate the props as quickly. If the motor accelerates, the props lower angular velocity keeps it from accelerating too quickly. Same for deceleration: if the motor decelerates, the prop's momentum makes it want to stay fast. It is only when the prop's position exceeds the motor's position, that the centrifugal force will slow it down.

But you have to consider that the angular velocity is quite a lot - therefore the centrifugal force is very high and the prop will only slightly move in its mount, thus not really affecting the flight all that much. Especially, when you consider that most drones with foldable props (e.g. DJI Mavic series) are ""smart drones"": They probably considered that during development and made it so that the motor speed is only raised and lowered slowly, so the effect isn't too noticeable. Plus, these drones are quite heavy so a tiny little change in prop speed will probably not have a big impact on the position in the air.

As you can see below, the propellers have different angles relative to the motor position. Obviously, propellers can only be designed for one direction of movement. Since the direction changes however, depending on whether it is accelerating or decelerating or at a constant speed, the uplift will be slightly reduced during speed changes of the props.

"N.B.: This applies particularly to drones, and to a lesser extent to helicopters.  Airplanes are a totally different field and would require a separate answer.
Obviously the more power per weight... the better.  But basically you want to be able to get enough energy out of the motor to be able to hover at around half throttle.  There's a good tutorial here which explains the full process, but basically you'll have to do the following:
1. Make an estimation of the total weight
Be sure to include the weight of your motors in this calculation.
2. Multiply that weight by 2
This compensates for the fact that the drone has not only to hover but also to move upwards through the air.  If you build your drone and find it's too sluggish for what you want, simply increase this factor.
3. Find an engine that will generate 1/n thrust
...where n is the number of engines that you will have on the drone.  So for instance, if you calculated that the weight of your drone was going to be 800g, you'll want each motor to have roughly 400g of thrust.
For most propellor motors designed for flight, you'll be able to find what is called a &quot;thrust table&quot; which will list propellor size (be sure your body is big enough to leave space for the propellors to spin independently!), the amount of current it burns, thrust (usually measured in grams), etc.

"Only parallel-charge batteries with the same number of cells.

Safe parallel charging requires that the voltages on individual cells be close to each other. A difference of 0.1V per cell is considered to be the maximum safe difference (I found it online, and have used ever since, although I have no scientific proof of that).

One way to compare the packs before parallel-charging is to compare their total voltages and make sure that the maximum difference between any pair of packs does not exceed 0.1V times the number of cells. However, this may be unsafe due to the fact that some packs may have more unbalanced cells than others, so it is better to compare each pair of cells that will be charged in parallel.

With many packs of uneven charge, it may be possible to divide them into groups whose cell voltages are close enough to be safe to parallel-charge and then charge each group separately.

A parallel-charging board with enough protection is recommended, with fuses limiting the total current of each pack being the minimum. Some boards also have fuses or current indicators for each cell of each pack for more safety.

Choose an appropriate charge current, which equals the sum of charge currents of all parallel-charged packs. Charging at 1C times the number of packs seems to be reasonable and safe if there are no large differences in capacities and cell degradation between packs.

Regular safety rules of charging single LiPo packs apply, for example never leaving the batteries unattended while charging, keeping away from flammable materials, etc.

"TL;DR:

Brushed DC motors have two wires because they require DC current (+VCC and Ground), while brushless motors require more complex driving circuitry which controls the AC current required to drive them.



Despite sometimes looking similar on the outside, the functional principles of brushed DC motors and brushless DC motors (aka. BLDC motors) are quite different.

Brushed Motors

These function by physical commutation, where the rotation of the armature breaks and establishes contact with pads which continue reversing the direction of current flow through the coil. This mechanical process perpetuates the cycle of magnetic attraction and repulsion which turns the motor.



Brushless Motors

BLDCs use three wires which are driven by the ESC with a phase-shifted AC waveform. Each wire's waveform is shifted by 120 degrees from the other two.



This is because BLDC motors are indeed three-phase AC motors, each with usually more than one actual coil per phase. Inside the motor, phases are wired up in ascending order, e.g. 1 2 3 1 2 3 ...


",Why do brushless motors have 3 wires compared to 2 wires on a brushed motor?,"I'm familiar with regular DC motors, which is what brushed motors appear to be.

"The short answer is, yes. According to testing done here there is an observed 3db loss when folding the bottom half of a dipole which would be the same effect as cutting your output power in half. 

See this graph from the link above. At the bottom in red is the bend of the antenna and the blue line is the gain.



The 'T' antenna is called a dipole and it's a very common antenna design. Changing the shape of the antenna will almost always change the antenna's gain and radiation pattern. Unless you have tested very carefully or are following a known and tested antenna design, chances are you aren't improving its performance. This article describes what one person went through to test folding a dipole by 90 degrees. Other things to keep in mind, the L shape allows your antenna to be polarized in two directions, while it might have worse reception under certain circumstances it may be better in others. This could be especially useful on a quad in situations where the orientation of the antenna would not be straight up and down.

"Technically, you could connect 2 motors, and it will probably work if they're exactly the same size and model, and have identical props on them. However, if the motor-prop combinations are sufficiently different, most likely the system will behave quite erratically, and even if you do match the motors, there is still a good possibility of weird stuff happening anyway. To see why, though, we must dive into how brushless motors actually function.
The problem with connecting more than one motor to a single ESC stems from how these motors are driven. An electric motor works by using electromagnetic coils to pull permanent magnets and create a force on the rotor. However if you just supply current to a coil and leave it as is, at first a close-by magnet will get attracted to the coil, rotating the motor bell, but then it will just sit there in the nearest position (towards which it is being pulled), perhaps briefly oscillating back and forth like a pendulum before settling.
To create a continuous rotation, you need to stop the current as the magnet passes by and then reverse it to now repel the magnet, adding more rotational momentum to the system. In a brushed motor this switching is done mechanically using contacts (called brushes in this case) inside of the motor. A brushless motor, on the other hand, does not have this kind of mechanical switching mechanism inside, so the switching must be done externally, and this is the brushless ESC's job.
To determine when to switch the currents around, the ESC must detect when the magnets are passing the coils. To do that it constantly measures the voltages on its three terminals (as a magnet passes by an electromagnetic coil, it creates a voltage in it), and uses that information to switch the currents in the motor in perfect sync with the motor's rotation, speeding up the current pulses as the motor speeds up and slowing them down as it slows down.
Real-world ESCs and motors are not perfect, though. sometimes the ESC is incorrect in its assumptions about what the motor is doing right now or how it's going to react, and sends current pulses that don't correspond to the motor's actual position. This is called desynchronization, or, colloquially, desync, and results in the motor suddenly losing almost all of its power for a short amount of time (usually less than a second) while the ESC tries to determine the correct state of the motor and reapply power in sync with its rotation. With quadcopters this condition is most common when the motors are spinning at very low RPM, loaded by a reverse airflow (e.g. falling out of the sky bottom-down) and need to suddenly speed up, all of which mess with the ESC's expectations, and the desync can lead to a violent uncontrolled spin due to one of the motors losing power while the others successfully apply full thrust.
Now, if you connect two motors, the ESC will still think it's one motor. If these two motors are sufficiently different, the most likely thing is that one (or both) of them won't work. Different motors will both create voltages of different magnitudes when rotated, and react with different speed to currents flowing through their coils, so one of the motors will invariably get far ahead of the other in response to a current pulse, making synchronization of the two near-impossible, and leaving the ESC very confused. Depending on the ESC and motor combination, it can either give up entirely, or try to drive this weird &quot;motor&quot; anyway, likely leading to one of the motors spinning at reduced efficiency and the other just jerking but not spinning. If you keep this up long enough, the non-spinning one may (or may not) burn its coil windings, as these motors are not designed to sit still while high currents are passed through them.
If the motors are identical, though, e.g. of the same brand and model, and with identical propellers, they are likely to want to rotate at about the same speed and have very similar inertia, in which case they will produce more or less the same induced voltages in their wires and react the same to what's supplied by the ESC. So this setup will probably work, at least on the ground: The two motors will spin, and do that in perfect sync with each other; you can leave them spinning for half an hour and never see one propeller get even ten degrees ahead of another. Even then, nothing is perfectly matched. One motor will likely be a tiny bit ahead of the other all the time, or otherwise slightly off, which is probably not enough for triggering a desync, but means a more confused ESC and less efficiency overall, since one of the motors (or both) is going to be driven suboptimally, consuming a bit more power and producing a bit less thrust.
Further, when you mount the motors on an actual airplane, conditions may become even more unequal. Suppose that one of these &quot;identical&quot; propellers is chipped, or the plane is flying in a crosswind, or even that it's just in a banked turn, so one wing moves through the air slightly faster than the other. Then the load on the motors can differ considerably even though they are the same. Because of that differing load, one of them might get just enough ahead of the other to confuse the ESC into either giving up entirely, or making erratic assumptions about this weird combined &quot;motor&quot;, leading to wrong signals being sent, which might, for example, slow down one motor and speed up the other, possibly ending in one of them desyncing and stopping entirely. This, in turn, can potentially lead to very unpredictable behavior of the model in flight.
So, to conclude this long-winded explanation, the answer to your question is:
Don't. Just don't.

"This is a personal approach, so like all financial advice it's only worth what you paid for it.
If you have worked with the insurance industry in the past, you will likely have learned that good insurance companies pay out almost (if not more) money than they take in. This is because what the insurer is doing is taking the premiums and lending them out, much like a bank. So when you spend \$100/yr across 10 years, and you get back a $1000 payout in the tenth year, the entire time the insurance company has been earning interest on the money you gave them. This 5-10% overhead is quite profitable when you have tens and hundreds of billions of dollars stockpiled.
The upshot is that insurance won't save you any money in the long-term, it only spreads the financial pressure of a decision across time. I only consider insurance worthwhile when the cost of throwing my hands up and walking away is unacceptably high. Put another way, I only get insurance when either required by contract or law (e.g. renters insurance or auto insurance), or when I cannot afford the consequences of not having the thing which is insured.

Worthwhile: I have a pet, and I don't want to have a financial consideration enter into whether life-saving surgery is an option.
Not worthwhile: I have a television which I don't really watch and wouldn't miss it if it weren't there anymore.

You'll have to decide for yourself the impact of losing your drone. If it's just a toy and you don't think you'll fly it again if you lose it, then maybe it's not worth the cost of insurance. If it's your livelihood and you can't afford to buy another one then insurance is a guarantee against catastrophic business failure.
Or if the amount of damage you could do with your drone could cause you to be personally liable for a ruinous amount, then you might want to protect yourself with insurance.
P.S. Drop a comment when you decide, I'd love to know how your reasoning went.

"In order to access the 32kHz gyro sampling mode, the gyroscopes in question (e.g. ICM 20689) would be switched to an experimental mode where there is higher gyro data jitter, and that sampling at the lower 8kHz frequency made use of lower overall latency lowpass filtering built into the gyro.
Often to get usable gyro data from the 32kHz sampling rate, more filtering was required, and the overall phase delay response meant that the FC would not be able to start compensating for a change in craft orientation any faster.

The other part is that in terms of pure filtering performance, the net gain achievable assuming identical gyro signal-to-noise ratio performance is on the order of tens of microseconds.  The bigger potential improvement would be to use the higher sampling rate to enable enhanced/fast Kalman filtering where the PID calculations can take into account more data, however, the input noise in that experimental 32kHz mode means the net improvement is minor for the computational cost involved, and that better performance is achievable at the lower sampling rate the IMU units available right now (that meet the cost and form factor requirements to install onto cheap FPV UAS systems)

Practically, lower overall phase delay response with RPM notch filtering and moving lowpass filters well beyond the prop wash and flight input frequency space, which results in much better overall performance, and often reduced motor heat in flight across a wide range of flight envelopes because less amplification of gyro noise is occurring, particularly through the D term of a PID controller which amplifies higher frequency oscillations.

"Checking Direction

In Betaflight you can have your motors spinning either props out or props in. The default is props in (towards the body of the quad from the front and back). Be aware other flight control software such as FlightOne and Kiss have different defaults.

Default Direction



Reversed Direction



If you are running props out, make sure you flip the switch on the Betaflight configuration tab to adjust that, otherwise your first flight will be VERY short and very fast!

Note that this switch does not change the actual direction of the motors! It's just a way for you to tell betaflight which way they're actually spinning. To check that the displayed and actual directions match, do the following:

In Betaflight go to the motors tab, read the warnings, then plug in your battery and click the enable motors switch. Run up the motors one at a time from their slider and ensure they match the direction and position of the charts above.  

If you don't have access to a computer, alternatively you can simply arm your quad without props on and check the direction that way. Make sure you don't raise the throttle though, or airmode might kick in and you'll have the motors wind up due to I term buildup from the PID controller. This isn't an issue from the motors tab, so choose that option preferentially if you can.

In both cases, you can either brush the flat of your finger lightly against the motor or put a piece of tape on the shaft before you run them up. Make note of any motors that are out of order or not spinning the direction you want.

Changing Direction

There are two ways you can fix the motor direction. One relies on a soldering iron or bullet connectors, the second relies on using software to change the direction.

Method One - Physically Change the Wires.

On the motors that are not spinning the correct direction simply desolder and switch pads on the ESC of any two of the motor wires. This will swap the direction of that motor.

Method Two - Betaflight and BLHeliSuite

If you already have your computer up, you can use BLHeliSuite to change the motor direction. The first thing you need to do is identify what type of ESCs you have. If you have BLHeli_S ESCs you'll need the Suite labeled 16.XX from the BLHeli Google Share. If you're using BLHeli 32 ESCs, download the 32.XX Suite. 


Once you've downloaded the appropriate suite, make sure the Betaflight configurator is disconnected from your flight controller, extract the contents of the zip file, and run the executable. 
Make sure you select the E (Cleanflight) interface from the interface dropdown list.

Select the correct COM port from the dropdown list (the same as Betaflight) and click connect.

Click the ""Check"" button on the right, then you'll see a confirmation of your ESCs and some summary information.
 
At the bottom of the screen, right-click on the ESC number that needs to be reversed, then go to the ""Motor Direction"" slider and change the direction.

Click ""Write Setup"".

Repeat for any other ESCs needed and then click ""Disconnect"".


Once you've finished, go back and repeat the check process once again until everything is correct! That's all there is to it!

Put the propellers on correct

Finally, when you go flying, ensure that you put your propellers on according to the direction of your motors. Most flip outs are caused not by the motor spinning in the wrong direction, but by a right propeller being mistakenly put on a left motor or vice-versa!

If you're new to the hobby, it might help to carry a sheet of paper with you with the directions printed on it, or color-code your motors and props with a marker so you can't go wrong.

"If it were me, there are two different kinds of drones I would want. A tiny whoop and a cinewhoop.

Tinywhoop is a loose definition of a very small drone that's about 3 inches wide with guards/ducts around its props and weighing anywhere from 20-50g. They are very durable and fly in places nothing else could. You can assemble them yourself (very easy) or buy one pre-assembled for around $100. You can add a small, powerful LED that allows some pretty fun exploration in dark and very tiny spaces without the risk of loosing a larger, more expensive piece of equipment. Example video of someone flying in their house with the lights out

A cinewhoop is a larger drone, more like 6-7 inches wide and weighing 200-400g, also with ducts. Typically it's called a cinewhoop because it's about the smallest thing you would want to fly that can comfortably carry a GoPro. You could equip this with a much more powerful light and have a real blast flying around. Like tavis mentioned the DJI FPV system would be an excellent setup for caves as it has great video quality and is very resistant to signal multipathing which is a very common affliction of analog video systems like what you would install on a tiny whoop. Multipathing is likely to be a very real issue inside a cave. If you could live with the analog break up though there are few 'starlight' type analog cameras that can operate in very dark environments. However, I don't think that would be nearly as enjoyable or as useful as a 1000+ lumen flashlight strapped to a DJI equipped cinewhoop. That would be awesome.

I would say your typical DJI consumer drone would not be well suited to a dark cave. Without GPS they would rely on downward-firing cameras for position hold which doesn't work in the dark. You could possibly rig up light to assist the cameras but I would guess that it still wouldn't work very well.

"This is an understandably confusing topic because of how the names evolved, and some of those acronyms have become more of a marketing label rather than an actual term. So I'm going to dive a bit deeper into the origins of these names and why the distinction between them exists.

The term ""BEC"", which stands for Battery Elimination Circuit, has its roots in gas planes. Since their main thrust source was non-electric, they had a separate (usually NiMH) battery to power the receiver and servos, which since those days traditionally take around 4.8 to 6 volts. So when people started putting electric motors on aircraft for thrust, the arrangement stayed the same for a while: A separate big (and high-voltage) battery for powering the main motor, and a small, 5 volts-ish battery for powering the control electronics, which could not take the higher voltage of the main battery.

Thus, a BEC was a voltage regulator that would eliminate that second battery by providing regulated power for the receiver and servos directly from the main battery. 

The simplest BEC is a linear regulator (sometimes called LBEC), a device that drops the voltage of its output by dropping the rest of the voltage on a variable resistor that would dissipate the power flowing through it. The problem with that is that since it works by dissipating the extra power, it's very inefficient when the voltage difference is high: If you've got a 12V main battery and a 5V output consuming 1A of current, the linear BEC must consume the other 7V and 1A of current and lose that to heat. If you've got a 16V battery, that's 11V*1A: more than twice the useful power is just lost to heat! And while you might not care about the loss itself (the main motor is probably eating a whole lot more than that anyway), the fact that the thing heats up like crazy might be a problem.

So if your control electronics and servos are sufficiently power-hungry, you need a switching voltage regulator or SBEC. Switching regulators convert voltages with hardly any power loss, and so can give out lots of amps without heating up too much. An inherent drawback of these regulators is a slightly oscillating output voltage (the technical term for that is ripple):



Different switchers smooth it out to varying degrees (one of the best ways is to stick a separate linear regulator after the switching one), but it's usually still there even after smoothing.
Anyway, basic plane electronics (i.e. receiver and servos) usually don't care whether there is any ripple or not, as long as it's not too big, so it was the best option for some time.

Somewhere along the way came the idea of integrating this regulator into the ESC, since it gets battery power anyway, and in planes plugs into the receiver with a 3-pin servo header, thus being able to provide regulated power through that header. Thus, for an RC plane, having the BEC built into your ESC means eliminating a whole additional regulator board and not having to wire anything to power your receiver and servos: you only need to plug in the ESC, and voila, all your electronics have power.

For multicopters and multi-motor planes, this can get weird, as you have multiple ESCs, and each wants to provide its own power. And having multiple switching regulators try to output to the same place can lead to... unexpected results. Possibly (though unlikely) even explosive, so flight controllers usually have their own BECs and usually don't have pins/pads for power on their motor connections, while bigger planes tend to use a standalone BEC.

Now come the marketing terms. a UBEC is a ""Universal"" or sometimes even ""Ultimate"" BEC. These are just (hopefully) high-quality standalone voltage regulators that can feature bigger available currents, higher efficiency, better output ripple smoothing (sometimes via a linear regulator), selectable voltages (5V or 12V, sometimes also 6 and 9V, or even the whole range), better reliability, etc.

OPTO is the weirdest of the bunch. Technically, it stands for ""optocoupler"", which is a way of electrically isolating your ESC from the other electronics entirely. This can be beneficial when dealing with really high voltages and/or currents, as the voltage ripple generated in the power supply by the motors themselves can be quite high, especially during fast RPM acceleration or braking, and can feed back to your control electronics through either power or ESC control wires. As such, this feature is primarily prominent on the huge, honking 80+ amp airplane ESCs with radiators. However, some quadcopter ESCs are also known to have optocoupling. Since the point of Opto is to not have your FC electrically connected to the ESC, it is almost entirely mutually exclusive with having an inbuilt BEC in the ESC. However on the market that's not always the case, and the term is routinely confused with other things even by the manufacturers, so if you see this marking on an ESC it might be something else. Some models of ESC even use the word OPTO to indicate that they do have an onboard BEC!

"According to electronics-notes.com, the mating cycle rating for the SMA/RP-SMA connector is 500 cycles. However, it is important to note that this rating assumes that the connection and disconnection process happens as smoothly as possible, with the body of the connector not moving at all while the screw connection is tightened sufficiently to not allow the joint to shift while connected. Under nonideal conditions, the actual lifespan of the SMA connectors on FPV goggles is likely to be far shorter.

Under the best of circumstances, the connection would likely last: (assuming one mating cycle per flight session)


~19 years @ 2 sessions/month
~9.5 years @ 1 session/week
~5 years @ 2 sessions/week
~2.5 years @ 4 sessions/week
~1.4 years @ 7 sessions/week


From this, we can see that the answer likely depends on how often you fly and how long you would like your goggles to last. Although the attenuation (signal strength reduction) of the connector will increase with every mating cycle, if you fly infrequently enough it is possible that you may be ready to upgrade to a new goggle by the time that the SMA connectors begin to become a serious problem.

If you take care to make and break connections cleanly, casual pilots who don't fly very often might not see too much of a problem, but more serious pilots who fly more than once a week definitely shouldn't be removing their antennae on a regular basis.
",How fragile are the SMA connectors used in FPV equipment?,"I've heard that it is a terrible idea to install and remove SMA antennae from my goggles every time I need to pack it away after a flight session.

"This design is to prevent unwanted yaw when moving, or vice-versa.

Consider the following two actions:


When a quadcopter yaws, it does so by creating a speed difference between the opposite-rotating rotors; creates a torque that rotates the quad.  
When a quadcopter moves left/right, it does so by slowing all the motors on one side of the frame and/or speeding those on the other, imparting a slight roll - the thrust is now slightly sideways, so it moves. (This is the same for front/back.)


From this, you can infer that if the same-direction rotors were on the same side as each other, when creating a speed difference to yaw the aircraft you would also impart a roll. Similarly, when trying to roll the aircraft would yaw.

The image below shows visually how an opposite-corner rotation quadcopter moves:


",Why do a quadcopter&#39;s opposite rotors spin in the same direction?,"All the quadcopters I've seen have four motors, arranged in a square-like shape. Two of these rotors spin one way, and two of them spin the other way so that the main body of the quadcopter doesn't rapidly spin as it flies. (Conservation of angular momentum.)

I find it interesting that the two rotors that spin in the same direction are opposite, not adjacent. Why not put the two anticlockwise-spinning rotors on one side and the two clockwise-spinning rotors on the other side? That seems the natural way to do it.

So what makes the opposites-spin-the-same design better?

"Neither Google nor DJI have specified the precise reasons why DJI chose to remove their apps from Google Play store.  The nearest we have to an official response from either side has come from the DJI Support Twitter account, and a reply posted to a service announcement on the DJI forum.
The standard response from the DJI Support Twitter account has been:

We apologize for the inconvenience. Because the compatibility strategy between the DJI App and Google Play Store is changing, you currently cannot finish downloading and updating using Google Play. Thank you for your understanding.

They do not specify exactly what the issue with their &quot;compatibility strategy&quot; is, but it appears that his has been the standard response since their Tweet on 13 December 2021.
The same statement was still being used on 10 May 2022)

On 14 March 2022, DJI Support posted a service announcement on Updating Channels for DJI apps (for Android Users).  On 29 April 2022, an admin replied to a user question by stating:

Hi, there. The update channels for DJI apps have been adjusted due to Google Play technical adjustments. Please download the latest version of DJI Go 4 from our official website to check if the problem persists.

Again, the precise &quot;technical adjustments&quot; that led to DJI removing their apps from the Play Store weren't specified.  It may indeed be the result of Google requiring new apps, published after August 2021, to use the AAB (Android App Bundle) framework, rather than the traditional APK (Android Application Package) format.  However, until or unless DJI choose to explain their reasons this will remain speculation.
It is worth noting that, although the AAB standard is open source, it is not presently clear whether other portals (like Amazon App Store, for example) support the framework.  If they do not, then developers like DJI would either need to publish two versions of their Android apps or withdraw their apps from some portals.

"An important first step to take when getting into drones is learning to fly them. The very first drone I would recommend to someone is a cheap drone that can be used to learn to fly. It can be disheartening to buy an expensive drone only to crash it and have lost hundreds or thousands of dollars which is why learning to fly with a cheap drone first is a good idea so you can master the skills of controlling the drone. Your very first drone should be any drone cheap enough to not feel bad when it crashes. The Eachine e010 is a basic drone you could learn to fly with. 

If you are looking to get into making videos with drones there are two major types to consider: Freestyle/acro drones or professional video drones. The videos you see of drones going really fast, avoiding obstacles, and doing stunts are high-performance freestyle or racing drones. Videos of scenes and landscapes are often from drones designed to carry a professional camera and are used to get extremely steady, smooth videos. 

If you want a relatively inexpensive freestyle drone I recommend the iflight Nazgul5 or iflight Cidora SL5-E because it is a quality drone that performs very well for a very reasonable price. This drone has a camera on it for FPV but a GoPro would be needed to make good quality footage. 

A good inexpensive camera drone that comes with a stabilized, quality camera is the DJI Mavic mini. It is not too expensive and it is light enough to not need registration. After that, there are many more good camera drones that are more expensive.

"So many different issues, I study a lot of the FAA regulations closely but have contemplated this same question a few times.

The power and weight of gear is heavy, so to make it all the way around is not going to happen without a lot of hacking. (solar proof of concept or similar notwithstanding)
Efficiency of solar (power and weight) is a problem. The square feet of solar needed is quite large and disproportionate to how we conceptualize &quot;RC planes&quot;.  These vehicles are really flying solar arrays.
Data, control, tracking, and safety assurance is much harder half way around the globe, even with satellite assistance
Satellite data and connectivity hardware is still big leaving this type of task to the larger military units.

From a regulatory perspective

FAA would rather cut their hand off than issue BVLOS waiver
Patchwork problems internationally exist not only for aviation, but also frequency use . EU radio freqs are very different.  When traveling to fly internationally it takes a while to make sure I am legal or have legal gear.
Clearing airspace for these attempts is a serious undertaking of budget and politics.

Weather is a huge concern for small craft.  Variations in the strata of the atmosphere are no joke. Be it thin air at altitude, winds, cold/hot temperature, all of this is hard for a small craft to manage.

&quot;At heights of 7 to 16 kilometres, the air in jet streams moves at constant speeds of over 25 metres per second or 90 kilometres an hour.&quot; source

The US Military is one of a few orgs with advanced programs for this type of use.  The U.S. military UAS groups has Tier 2+ with a '3,000-nautical-mile (6,000 km) radius'. These devices range from sub-55 pound to 2+ ton vehicles.

"So this method will vary based on whether they are brushed or brushless motors.

For brushed:

Spin the propeller with your fingers - is anything actively resisting the motion?

If yes, remove the prop and check for something not immediately visible, like a hair or carpet fibres caught around the motor shaft.

Remove anything you find and try the prop again.

If nothing is resisting motion, check the connections between the FC and the motor.

If all else fails, swap the motor with the one diagonal from it. If the problem travels, the motor is at fault. If not, there is trouble with the board.

It is worth noting that brushed motors are a consumable - the brushes wear out, and most aren’t rated for more than a number of hours’ use - see the diagram below:



(Image Source)

If the motor is brushless, start by again turning the motor, and check no screws are touching the windings.

Check all motor connections and see if there are any breaks.

If there is not active resistance, swap over two of the motors. If the problem follows the motor, it is likely a problem with the motor. If not, there is a problem with one of the ESCs.

If you do encounter active resistance, look inside the bell and see if any of the magnets have slipped. If they have, use epoxy and tweezers (though a toothpick also works well) to glue the magnet back in place. I’d recommend also buying a new motor as it is now likely to be slightly unbalanced which may cause oscillations.

"I've gone out and asked an actual racer about this one.

There are usually some visual cues. The course is laid out in cones, the flags are asymmetrical so you know on which side you should pass, the gates you must fly twice through usually have something (bright fabric, a flag, ...) next to them on the side that you fly around before going back into the gate, etc. and the cones themselves are not just a flat string but are laid out in certain patterns; for example, when the sequence of cones terminates in an arrow this usually indicates you should go upwards (or higher, i.e. in the case of two gates stacked on top of each other), while a perpendicular line marks the entry point of the cone string.

Sometimes the track elements are colored differently (and asymmetrically) to indicate the direction. Some elements just have canonical uses based on their shape: you should pass through gates, fly besides flags, dive the dive gates... The Jacob's ladder specifically is almost always passed top to bottom in sequence (while whether you should go right or left varies track to track).

That said, there is no universally accepted, set-in-stone standard for these cues. Which ones are used depends a lot on the materials available to the race organizers, how much time they have to set up the track, the track's layout, etc. For instance, flags can either be fabric on a springy pole (in which case you fly on the convex side), or they can be inflatable and curved to hang over the ground (in which case you fly under the overhang on the concave side).

Most drone racing leagues have their own standard of how different track elements and maneuvers should be marked on the racetrack and try to stick to it. Even then some smaller local or regional events of the league may be limited by the organizers not having all the required materials. Also, one cannot mark everything on the more complicated, technical tracks, or mark it in an unambiguous manner. Sometimes some parts of the track are formed by the terrain itself, i.e. an abandoned building or natural rock formation. In that case there's no standard and the track designers must get creative to even make it clear where the gates are!

So visual cues aren't everything. A lot of races rely on communicating to pilots how the track should be flown before the race. Sometimes it's a verbal briefing, sometimes a printed schematic. Sometimes the track is published well in advance so pilots could train on their home field or in a simulator. There could even be a video walkthrough or a DVR of a practice run. Additionally, many leagues actually perform a physical walk through of the track on or before race day (much like Formula 1 car racing), so that the marshals and pilots can discuss challenges, specific items and hazards, etc.

In the end, for serious racing, how the track itself is marked does not matter. During the actual race the speed at which everything is happening does not leave you any time to think or figure out what's coming next by parsing the track. The racer just knows in advance which gate or maneuver comes after the one he's flying through, and anticipates it, most likely along with the one after that as well. Knowing the track is a very important factor in winning a race, as in order to have the fastest (which usually means shortest) trajectory, the pilot must start the necessary maneuvers for passing the next gate while he has not yet passed the previous one. 

Besides training beforehand and learning the track from the given materials, the racers are always allowed to fly some laps around the actual final track before the race in order to memorize its layout. This is critical as the actual racetrack will always slightly differ from whatever training track they might have constructed for themselves. During these training laps they also figure out the best way to tackle the elements of that particular track in the speediest way possible, and thus develop an optimal trajectory, or racing line, as it's usually called. 

So, in the end, the on-track markings are there just to aid in the initial few laps as the track is being learned by the pilot, and after that, memory takes over.

The first, as mentioned before, is to push down the bootloader button and power on your board.

The second method is to be used on boards that don’t have a bootloader button (which is increasingly rare). You will need to bridge two bootloader pads on your flight controller to enter DFU mode.

"As someone who loves collecting data for analysis, I do track all of my flights.  I have found that, under normal conditions, brushed motors should last for at least a few hundred flights.  You can get higher if you don't fly hard or get things caught in the props or motor shaft that will make the motor heat up more than normal.  

How to determine whether a brushed motor needs to be replaced is a tough question and it really depends on your willingness to fly with a drone that isn't operating perfectly.  With mine, the telltale indicator is that I notice less power than usual and yaw is off a bit (twitchy or lethargic).  This makes sense since all motors perform to the level of the least capable motor.  If you experience less performance, first, ensure that it's not just the battery.  This is easy to do - just use a newer battery, or one that you know is still providing good power.  The next thing to do, if the battery checks out, is to replace the motors.  I recommend replacing all of the motors at once for brushed motors since they are all getting some form of wear while in use.  Replacing them all ensures that you are starting with peak performance.
",How do I tell when to replace the motors on my tinywhoop?,"I own a brushed micro quadcopter, more commonly known as a tiny whoop. I've read that brushed motors in general, and especially those used in such quadcopters, have a limited lifetime and that you should replace them when they near the end of that lifetime. 

However, as far as I can tell, there are no obvious signs that the motors have become too old to fly, as they don't break but instead their performance decreases over time.

"There is actually no such thing as a 6-axis gyro; the correct term for this is ""IMU"", which stands for ""Inertial Measurement Unit"". An IMU is a device that combines several inertial sensors that measure the craft's orientation and position in space.

The 6-axis IMU is a composite sensor, which contains two different types of 3-axis sensors on one chip. Usually it is a 3-axis gyroscope (which measures the rate of rotation of whatever it's strapped onto) and a 3-axis accelerometer (which measures its linear acceleration). A 3-axis gyro, on the other hand, is just the gyro and nothing else, as a standalone chip. There are also standalone 3-axis accelerometers¹, but accelerometers are almost never used in flying vehicles alone, without gyroscopes.

The third type of sensor that an IMU can contain is a magnetometer, which measures the earth's magnetic field² and can be used to tell which way is north. A magnetometer can either be present as part of a 9-axis IMU, of another sensor (e.g. in a GPS unit) or an entirely standalone unit.
Do you need the accelerometer and magnetometer? Well, it depends.


For rate mode (or acro mode, as it's more commonly known), the aircraft only needs to know its rates of rotation along all three axes and matches them to the desired rates set by the pilot via stick positions. For this, just the gyro is sufficient.
However, in attitude, angle or autolevel mode (also sometimes called stabilized mode), in which the pilot defines the desired attitude(orientation) relative to the horizon, which the drone will match, a gyroscope alone is insufficient. The flight controller will need to know not only how fast it is currently spinning, but also which way ""down"" is relative to itself. Due to a phenomenon called integration drift³, the flight controller can't maintain this knowledge precisely enough with just a gyro. It needs an accelerometer on board to correct the gyroscope, so if you want to use these modes, you need both a gyroscope and an accelerometer.
A magnetometer (sometimes referred to as a compass) is required for navigation modes, where besides its attitude relative to the horizon the craft has to also know its heading relative to the geographical north. Note that since navigation modes also require GPS, you could forgo the builtin magnetometer in the flight controller, and get a GPS unit with a magnetometer in it instead. Or you can get both, one in the FC and one in the GPS, which will increase the accuracy of the readings. (actually, you can double the other two sensors for the same effect; some flight controllers are manufactured with a twin IMU for that purpose.)




¹: There are also single- and dual-axis versions of each type of sensor — which only means you'll need several of those to make up a complete IMU. They are rarely used nowadays, as the integrated versions are usually better in every way.

²: Or any other magnetic field, for that matter, which is why you need to keep it away from magnets and steel structures, otherwise you'll get rubbish. There's usually little metal in the air other than what's on your aircraft, though, so magnetometers tend to work quite well in UAVs unless you've got a magnet-latched canopy and put the FC next to it or something. Minimizing interference is also why magnetometers are usually integrated into GPS units and mounted as far away from the rest of the aircraft as possible.

³: Integration drift is an issue that plagues inertial navigation since the beginning of time, and is present everywhere where you can't measure something directly, but you can measure how fast it's changing instead (in other words, you can measure the derivative of that thing). So you integrate it (add up the changes over time) to get the original value. However, every measurement comes with an error, and the errors add up as well, so your total error will grow all the time and at some point it will get bigger than the original thing you were measuring.

Intuitively, integration drift is like walking in a forest. When you enter the forest, you (hopefully) have a sense of which way north (or some other reference direction) is. As you walk, you can maintain a sense of direction for some time (""I was walking towards the north, so it was in front of me, now I turned left, north must be to my right now""). However, since you don't know precisely how much degrees you turned, every turn you make will introduce a small error into your direction estimate, and those errors will add up over time. A couple hours later your sense of direction will have drifted far enough from the original that you might be heading in the opposite direction from where you think you're going. Even if you tried to just walk in a straight line all the time you would probably stray off course eventually, because without external reference you have no way of telling whether you've actually been walking in a straight line (this is known as zero drift).

The only way out of this is to have an alternative source of direction knowledge (e.g. a compass or the combination of the sun's position and time of day, or some other observable directionality in your environment like a distant mountain) which you check regularly and use that knowledge to correct the error in your ""internal"" sense of direction.

A quadcopter in angle mode has the same problem: to stay upright it needs to know is where ""up"" is, and a gyroscope can only measure (as an approximation) how much degrees it's been rotated from its previous orientation; it does not know (or care) what that previous orientation was. And even if the FC did know its previous orientation, the estimate might have drifted far off from the original. That's where the accelerometer comes in: its job is to measure the earth's gravity, and therefore the direction of ""down"", and use that information to figure out the initial orientation when the quadcopter is armed (like knowing where north is when entering the forest), as well as correcting possible drift of the orientation obtained from the gyros in flight.

"tl; dr:


Analog is: 


Cheaper;
Lower resolution;  
Has a noisier, more staticky picture that breaks up gradually when the signal gets weaker. Analog image breakup, while unpleasant to the eye, is generally easier to see through.
Has a constant low latency; 
Is an entirely open standard, with anyone free to produce compatible equipment

Digital is:


Currently rather expensive,
Has (significantly) higher resolution, 
Has a way cleaner image, usually without a speck of static right up to the very limit of its range, but when it starts breaking up, it does so suddenly and in weird ways. The broken image is usually harder to see through than an analog signal. With DJI, for instance, the picture will suddenly get very blocky and low-res when it gets out of range.
Also, digital systems can have inconsistent latency that changes in flight (DJI in particular is known for this), although this mostly concerns the highest-performance pilots, such as racers.
The only digital system currently in widespread use is the DJI system, which is a proprietary standard with only two manufacturers authorized to make the gear.



Analog and digital systems have about the same usable range per unit of VTX power.

To compare how they look, it's better to just see the videos:


DJI HD system range &amp; breakup vs analog
ByteFrost image &amp; breakup




How they work and the reasons for noise/breakup related differences:

Anything that is encoded in a radio signal at a point in time can be represented as a level, which can be higher or lower; Thus the ""primary"" information encoded in the signal can be represented as a graph of this level over time:



In an analog system that level can take any value, within some range, which we'll think of as 0 to 100% for simplicity(*). It can be 20%, 70% or 48.573498%, theoretically to any degree of accuracy. The drawback to that is that any noise that's floating around in the radio spectrum will add to whatever signal you're receiving, so in practice, you'll get something like 40% (true signal) + 5% (noise) = 45% (received signal), and since the original signal could be anything, the receiver has no way of knowing which part of what it got is noise.

The image that your goggles receive is made up of pixels, and the color that each of them has is encoded as percentages of red, green and blue: zero to 100%. An analog TV system encodes this picture by ""scanning"" over all of the pixels in sequence, line by line, and setting the signal's level equal to each pixel's brightness in turn. For example, this oscilloscope picture represents the TV signal for the ""colored bars"" picture:

 

The ladder you see represents how the brightness level of the pixels changes from left to right in each line of the image.
There are also other signals overlaid on top of it, these correspond to the lines closer to the bottom of the image, which have other sequences of colors in them (the oscilloscope displays all the lines together on one screen).

The consequence of all that is that whenever there's another signal on your frequency around, it gets added to your VTX's signal and through that directly to your picture. Since usually that other signal is noise(**), your picture is overlaid with noise.
When your signal is strong, the noise is a very small percentage of it and is usually unnoticeable by the eye. As the useful signal gets weaker, though, the noise (which stays the same) will get stronger compared to it, so the percentage of noise in your picture increases. At some point, it will become so strong that you couldn't see any useful signal in the picture anymore.

In a digital system, however, only two levels are available: 0 and 1, represented by 0% or 100%(***). The image is encoded into a sequence of bits using a special algorithm, called a codec, and decoded from that sequence on the other end, almost exactly like online video. Besides simply encoding the video feed, one of the most important functions of modern codecs is to compress it, so that it can be communicated in a significantly smaller amount of bits, which in turn means that higher-resolution video can be transmitted with the same bitrate (number of bits sent per second).

Since radio signals are by their nature analog, on the receiving end noise will still be added to the signal, so if a 0 was transmitted and 10% of noise is added by the environment, the received result is 10% — but since the receiver knows that only either 0 or 100% could have been transmitted, it picks the closest possible level, in this case, 0.

This means that when you transmit digital data, noise is just ignored until a certain point: Even when noise levels are as high as half of the analog signal (which creates a picture that's rather hard to parse), with digital you receive exactly the same information as you would if there were no noise, with the resulting video perfectly clear. However, when the relative noise level does pass the critical threshold, ones will start suddenly (and randomly) becoming zeroes and vice-versa. What happens to the video after that depends on the particular digital system and how the video is encoded in it. 

With the DJI system, the whole screen suddenly becomes low-res and blocky, occasionally skipping frames, and the latency increases. The cumulative effect of this can range from ""just an unpleasant-looking image"" to ""totally unflyable"".



With Fatshark's Bytefrost system (currently in development/beta testing), random bits of the image will flash with colored blocks, while the rest remains high-resolution. The manufacturer touts this ""analog-like"" style of image breakup as a feature of the system.



In both cases, digital breakup, when it does happen, is arguably harder to see through than analog breakup, because our brain still has better error correction software than seen in these systems. This is also due to the fact that digital images, while crystal clear up to a point, start breaking up sharply after that point and quickly get to ""very hard to parse"" levels, while an analog picture is already quite static-ridden by then and just continues to gradually get worse.

That said, digital systems can employ error-correcting codes and other tricks to be able to recover from a certain percentage of errors, at the expense of reduced bitrates, yielding a lower-quality image which can be decoded from a longer distance.  you'll typically see them start to gradually reduce image quality before breaking down completely, giving you some warning signs that you are going out of range. There is also usually a link health indicator somewhere in the corner that is similar to the RSSI reading for RC control systems which you could look at to see if you're going out of range. You probably aren't going to be looking at it all the time, though, and a low signal indication can be missed, while it's hard to miss an image full of static and getting worse.



Footnotes:


(*): The analog signal can technically be any real number, and can sometimes go beyond its designated range, i.e. in our example be less than 0 or bigger than 100%. How the system handles the signal going out of its designated boundaries is the system's business.
(**): the other common kind of interfering signal is your own signal that's reflected off of something. In which case you will get two of the same picture overlaid on top of each other, but one of them which is slightly late and is shifted to the right because of that. This is called multipath interference, or multipathing, and is a major source of image degradation with analog FPV systems. Cutting down on multipath signals is also the primary reason why circular-polarized antennae are used in FPV..
(***): Actually, a digital system can have more than two values, and there are different ways of representing them as analog levels; the main distinguishing factor is that there's a fixed (integer) number of them. For example, for a simple digital system with 4 levels, they would be 0, 33%, 66%, and 100%, with corresponding ranges of -∞ to 16%, 16-50%, 50-83%, and 83%-∞.

"OpenTX can be built from source for your receiver using various compile options which may be useful.

Enabling USB_SERIAL and CLI will allow connection to your pc using a serial connection, which you can use for bidirectional communication.

You will need to add code to the OpenTX firmware to accept commands from the pc, to control the radio. It may be simplest to utilize the trainer variables to control the outputs.

The changes required are:

in cli.cpp, connect the serial to the trainer variables:

int cliSet(const char ** argv)
{
  if (!strcmp(argv[1], ""trainer""))
  {
    int thr;
    int chan;
    if ( (toInt(argv, 2, &amp;chan) &gt; 0)
       &amp;&amp;(toInt(argv, 3, &amp;thr) &gt; 0))
    {
        ppmInput[chan] = thr;
        ppmInputValidityTimer = 240;//PPM_IN_VALID_TIMEOUT;
        serialPrint(""!"");
    }
  }
  ...cliSet continues
}


in mixer.cpp, enable all trainer channels by default:

// comment out this check
//        &amp;&amp; isFunctionActive(FUNCTION_TRAINER_STICK1+ch)


in trainer.cpp, clear all trainer signals after timeout:

void checkTrainerSignalWarning()
{
   ...
   else if (!ppmInputValidityTimer &amp;&amp; (ppmInputValidState == PPM_IN_IS_VALID))
   {
      ppmInputValidState = PPM_IN_INVALID;
      AUDIO_TRAINER_LOST();
      memset(ppmInput, 0, sizeof(ppmInput));   //clear all trainer inputs
   }
   ...
 }


You should then be able to use commands over serial such as:

set trainer 1 500


to control channel 1 to a value of 500

"TL;DR:
The configurable scale ranges for the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer on the MPU-9250 IMU affect the maximum resolution and range of the reported values.
As you increase the full-scale range setting, the maximum value/rate that can be reported by the IMU before the IMU is saturated increases, but the resolution of the value/rate decreases.

Section 3.1 of the datasheet for the Invensense MPU-9250 has a table that states the &quot;Gyroscope ADC Word Length&quot;, which represents how large the values reported over the I2C or SPI interfaces are. In this case, the gyro word length is 16 bits. A 16 bit two's complement binary number (explained wonderfully in this video by Ben Eater) can range from -32768 to +32767.

Take the example of the ±500 °/s full-scale range. The unit resolution of the two's complement value reported by the gyro (aka Least Significant Bit/LSB resolution) in the ±500 °/s full-scale range is: $\frac{32767}{500} = 65.534$ LSB/(°/s) (degrees per second per LSB). This is not coincidentally labeled in the graph as the &quot;Sensitivity Scale Factor&quot; for the FS_SEL=1 condition.

"The main way is through 'situational awareness'; if you are flying the aircraft, you should have an idea of what is it doing based on what it has done, and what you have commanded it to do. For example, if it is flying from right to left as you look and you command a right turn, then when the plane appears to have no horizontal movement it is going away from you.
However, it is common and easy to briefly lose this awareness. In this case, I would take what I can see and attempt a manoeuver that I know the outcome of:

If the aircraft looks like it is either coming towards me or going away, I will roll slightly - if I command 'right wing down' and the right wing goes down, I am looking at the aircraft from behind. If the left wing (as I see it) dips, it is 'backwards' - i.e. coming towards me. (Of course, you could also use yaw and see which way the silhouette goes.)
If the aircraft is possibly flying inverted, I will use either elevator to lift/dip the nose or rudder to yaw the plane:

If it is flying left to right and I try to push the nose down but it goes up, the plane is inverted. (I would not expect to see a yaw movement very well in this case.)
If it is flying away from me and I try to yaw left and it goes left, it is the right way up. (Up/down movement would probably be visible in this orientation, but I prefer maintaining altitude.)



I've also used simulators, and find that it is also slightly easier to work this out in real life as things like depth perception help a lot.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that if you are flying in a country that requires you to keep the aircraft in &quot;Visual Line of Sight&quot; (or VLOS), if your aircraft is so far away that you cannot easily identify it's orientation visually, it is probable that you are no longer flying in VLOS conditions (as you cannot see what your aircraft is doing, even though you can see the aircraft.)

"OpenLager is one solution.
Tuning with auditory inputs is another (it's usually possible to hear oscillations caused by excessive P or D gains), but this is more challenging.  This is made significantly more challenging because often props are poorly balanced, and this can imitate the same sorts of errors.

"I found what looks to be a reasonable answer in CAP 722 - the UK's drone rules guidance document.
In short, it appears a vessel, vehicle or structure can be under your control if you have the permission of the captain/driver/owner, and any people are under your control. For people to be under your control, they must be willing and able to follow guidance and safety instructions of the pilot.
The long version (correct April 2020):

Article 95(2)(c) makes reference vessels, vehicles and structures being under the control of a remote pilot or operator.  A vessel or vehicle could be said to be ‘under the control’ of a person if:

That vehicle or vessel is present for the purpose of participating in the flight operation; and
The operator of the vehicle or vessel (for example the driver of a car or captain of a ship) and any passengers are under the control of the remote pilot and can reasonably be expected to follow directions and safety precautions to avoid unplanned interactions with the small unmanned aircraft; and
The owner or other person with an interest in the vessel or vehicle (such as a lessee) has granted permission for a UAS to operate within 50 metres of that vehicle or vessel.

A structure could be said to be ‘under the control’ of a person if:

The owner or other person with an interest in the structure (such as a lessee) has granted permission for a UAS to operate within 50 metres of that structure; and
Any occupants of the structure are under the control of the remote pilot.


For completeness, as the document referes to control of people:

Persons under the control of the SUA operator or remote pilot can generally be defined as:

Persons solely present for the purpose of participating in the flight operation.
Persons under the control of the event or site manager who can reasonably be expected to follow directions and safety precautions to avoid unplanned interactions with the small unmanned aircraft. Such persons could include building-site or other industrial workers, film and TV production staff and any other pre-briefed, nominated individuals with an essential task to perform in relation to the event.

Spectators or other persons gathered for sports or other mass public events that have not been specifically established for the purpose of the flying operation are not regarded as being ‘under the control’ of the of the SUA operator or remote pilot.
In principle, persons under the control of the SUA operator or remote pilot at a mass public event must be able to:

elect to participate or not to participate with the small unmanned aircraft flight operations;
understand the risk posed to them inherent in the small unmanned aircraft flight operations;
have reasonable safeguards instituted for them by the site manager and SUA operator during the period of any flight operations;
not have restrictions placed on their engagement with the purpose of the event or activity for which they are present if they do not elect to participate with the small unmanned aircraft operation.

Note: As an example, it is not sufficient for persons at a public event to have been informed of the operations of the small unmanned aircraft via such means as public address systems, website publishing, e-mail, text and electronic or other means of ticketing, etc. without being also able to satisfy the points above. Permissions have, however, occasionally been granted for small unmanned aircraft flights at public events where these involved a segregated take-off site within the main event, with the aircraft operating only vertically within strict lateral limits that keep it directly overhead the take-off site. Such flights may also be limited by a height restriction and the tolerance of the aircraft to wind effects and battery endurance.

"There are quite a few aspects of FPV, so a I’ll give a summary here. I’ll try to be concise so if any extra info is required or wanted, please let me know.

The first thing to look at when you’re flying FPV is the kind of aircraft, all the way up from a small Tiny Whoop to an X class (please not for beginners though!). In general, the larger props tend to give more flight time up to a point - it’s generally agreed that 7 inch props should be used for long-range because of this.

Video Transmitters

Another important thing to look at on your aircraft (excluding the advantages of different flight controllers etc, which I would love to talk about but would end up writing a massive wall of text) is the video transmitter, or VTX.

When looking at these, the first important thing is to check your local laws about what frequencies and transmitter powers you can use. Once you know that, keep in mind that more power tends to equal more range in open spaces, but can lead to more interference in places like abandoned buildings. 

Another important fact to remember about the VTX is that you should manually select the channel on your VTX AND goggles as auto-scan sometimes picks the wrong channel and will cut out after a few feet. Also, never turn on your VTX without an antenna installed, or you risk damaging it. It is perfectly normal for your VTX to get warm on the bench when there is no airflow.

Finally, you will see people talking about Smart Audio - this is just a way to control the settings on the VTX from your transmitter.

Other hardware

Motors are very important. If possible, get brushless motors as they last longer and are more powerful. 

When getting your first FPV quad, check out how repairable it is. It’s almost certain that at some point you will need to repair or modify it, so it’s good to know that before getting the quad.

Check what voltage your quad is designed to run at. If you have too little voltage, your quad will be underpowered, but if you have too great a voltage your quad may burst into flames (possibly a slight exaggeration to get a point across).

The ESC or Electronic Speed Controller is what tells your motor what to do, and you need one for each motor. If possible, get BLHeli_32 ESCs as they are more modern and natively support bidirectional Dshot so you can enable something called ‘RPM filtering).

When looking at flight controllers, the higher the value of X is in the naming format FX, the better. At the time of writing, F4 is the most common and F7 is becoming more popular. As I said, I won’t go into too much detail, but the higher the number, the more processes the CPU can complete per second so the more filtering and other leaguers you can have.

Goggles

There are two main types of goggles - box goggles and slimline goggles.

In general, slimline goggles are more expensive, lighter, arguably more comfortable and tend to have a narrower field of view and better quality displays. Box goggles, on the other hand, have massive screens and tend to be cheaper, however they are larger and heavier so may be less comfortable.

If possible, get goggles with a diversity receiver (or if you get Fat Sharks of Orqas, get a diversity receiver module like Rapidfire). This has two receivers and can either merge the two signals into one (cleaner) signal, or just automatically pick whichever signal is the strongest.

RC Transmitters

The most commonly used protocol at the moment is FrSky's D16, with Crossfire becoming more and more popular not only for long-range, but just for general flying.

When picking your transmitter, look for Hall gimbals, which use the Hall Effect to measure movement instead of potentiometers, so last longer and (apparently- I haven t used them) feel nicer.

Much of your transmitter will be personal preference, about the ergonomics and whether you pinch, thumb or hybrid-pinch.

Batteries

For anything more than 1S, you need a balance charger to make sure all the cells have the same voltage. To find the nominal voltage of a battery, multiply the number of cells by 3.7, as the nominal voltage of a single cell is 3.7.

I will leave you with this - don’t leave charging batteries unattended - LiPos are very dangerous if mistreated and can burst into flames if damaged or overcharged.

"Temperature is a killer of motors over time. If motors are exposed to prolonged heat, the magnets in the rotor lose their magnetic field strength over time and consequently reduce the lifespan of the motor.

Generally, a well-tuned drone should not have extremely hot motors after flying (with a few exceptions). It depends on the motor, but you should avoid raising the motor’s temperature past 170°F; any hotter, and you run the risk of damaging the rotor’s magnets and decreasing performance and longevity.

"I've pulled a few specs together from the parts you linked to:


Flight controller:

VTX:

Output: 5V 0.3A

You don't mention what size battery you are using, but I will assume it is in the FCs range of 2S to 6S.


The camera needs too much current (0.65A) to get it's 5V from the VTX (max 0.3A)
The VTX should be connected to the battery
The FC should be connected to the battery
The camera should be connected to the FC 5V supply


This wiring should work, if you have no other large 5V loads connected to the FC.

Alternatively you will need a separate DC-DC converter or regulator to supply the 5V. A capacitor is great for smoothing out surges in demand, but won't hold up the 5V rail if the load is constantly too large.
",How to prevent a 5V supply from sagging to 4.6V when the FPV camera is on?,"I have issues with my FPV camera. My camera is a RunCam split 2S (concept is similar to Caddx turtle).

This camera turns off almost instantly after I have plugged in my battery. When I probe the voltage between 5V and ground, I can see the voltage drop from 4.9V to 4.6V as soon as the camera starts recording (which it does automatically when powering it). Then, when the camera shuts completely off, the voltage goes up again. Also, I can press a button and the camera will turn on but also back off again

Hooking up a phone charger to the camera gets the voltage up again (and makes the camera run stably), but I obviously don't want to fly around with a power bank attached to my drone.

Unfortunately, the VTX is also wired to the flight controller's 5V converter instead of its own.

TL;DR: The issue is not that the voltage has too much ripple. The issue is that the voltage converter on my FC is not strong enough.

Would a capacitor at the input (XT60 connector) make any sense? If yes, which size should it be? I have 220µF and 1000µF electrolytic caps.

"The typical temperatures experienced across Europe shouldn't be a problem for LiPo storage; although depending on exactly where you are you may also want to check out this question: Do low temperatures damage LiPo batteries?

If your storage location may be subject to direct sun then this could cause extra heating which may be harmful - think of a dark colour car on a hot day. Having a light (e.g. white) box or keeping it in shade would help here.

Also, you do want to avoid condensation wherever possible as the moisture may cause corrosion or (if it pools/collects) may short the battery connectors. Many LiPo storage containers have vents to let pressure out if a battery fails and you don't want to seal these, so add the waterproof layer inside - something as simple as putting each battery in a zip-lock bag would work, for example.

Finally, storing the batteries at the appropriate storage charge level will help maximise their life wherever you store them - see At what voltage per cell should I store a LiPo?
",Will LiPo batteries deteriorate outside with the temperature changes due to day-night cycle?,"I am new to the hobby and I'm concerned about LiPo batteries. I live in an apartment (this is Europe, blocks of apartments are the norm in my country) so I can not put the batteries in a dedicated room or garage. Finding a spot in the house where I can put the LiPos 1 meter away from any flammable material seems impossible.

I do have, however, a convenient small balcony in which I could put a box with the batteries for safe(st) storage, something like a bat-safe, ammo or metal tool box, which have kind of proven they can withstand a LiPo fire; in a small plastic closet to protect them from rain insulating the metal box from the plastic closet with some drywall and maybe some sand.

The balcony does not receive direct sunlight, but temperatures vary from ~ 15C/59F (min) ~ 35C/95F (max) in summer and ~0C/32F (min) ~ 15C/59F in winter. Temperatures could very exceptionally reach a maximum of 45°C a couple of days at peak hours. From what I have read batteries can bare these ranges of temperatures without too much of a problem but, Will they suffer from the everyday variation of temperatures and humidity and will this increase the risk of them exploding?

The idea here is to maximize safety, I do not really care that much if their performance deteriorates or if I have to renew them more often, as long as this does not come with a higher risk.

"If you're up for it, the fix you're looking for is to repair the connector with a new housing and new crimps (if the current ones are broken). Joshua Bardwell has an excellent YouTube video documenting how to do this, but I'll summarize here.

Most LiPo balance leads are terminated with the JST-XH connector:

 (cit.)

In the above picture, the balance lead is configured such that the left-most pin is ground/GND and then are in ascending order of voltage from left to right when the flat surface of the connector housing is facing upwards. For example, a correctly made 4s LiPo balance plug would be wired up like so from left to right:


GND
Cell 1 (4.2 V when fully charged)
Cell 2 (8.4 V when fully charged)
Cell 3 (12.6 V when fully charged)
Cell 4 (16.8 V when fully charged)


Repair instructions:


Purchase a JST-XH connector kit like this one on Amazon and a JST-XH crimper tool like the Engineers PA-09 on Amazon if you know or anticipate you'll need to replace the crimped pins (there are cheaper crimpers available, but I've had little trouble crimping JST-XH with this one and it's a nice-feeling tool)
Pick out a new connector housing that's the same size as the broken one
Remove the lowest voltage pin (left-most pin in the above picture) from the broken housing using a pointy tool to lightly press down on the edge of the silver retention tab
If the pin is broken/bent/deformed, cut/pull off the JST-XH crimp and re-crimp a new one on
Insert the pin into the new housing with the little retention tab facing upward until the retention tab on the pin clicks into place
Repeat steps 3-5 for each other pin in order of ascending voltage


I'd recommend only having one pin free of either connector housing for as much of the process as possible to avoid inserting them in the wrong order or accidentally letting two of the pins tough each other, which would short the cells together (be bad).

Afterward, you should check your work by using a multimeter to confirm that the voltages between GND and each pin are in ascending order from left to right.

"A barometer and GPS are fairly low resolution (and noisy) methods for determining height and position respectively. As you've observed.
There are two other common methods for measuring height above the ground and position that, while they have limitations, give you much more precision. Sonar for height and optical flow for position. These are usually used in combination with the Barometer and GPS to provide the stability you find in DJI's products.
This higher precision mode will typically only work near the ground because of the range limitations of sonar. Since this is where you need the most stability however, it ends up working really well, allowing the less precise sensors to take over when you are farther away from obstacles.
Optical flow is the combination of downward facing cameras with software that takes the attitude and height of the craft into account and provides a relative movement of the craft. It will suffer in low light or when flying over reflective surfaces (like water).
You can add these sensors to ardupilot. They are relatively expensive compared to a barometer and gps, but should provide a similar level of stability when properly tuned.
",Hover stability: PX4 vs. DJI Mavic Mini,"About a year ago I started building my own drones. I've settled into Betaflight for FPV and PX4 for photography.

I realize my FPV build is specifically for that, but I would have expected PX4 to be on par with DJI since the baro and GPS.

"A dipole antenna is linearly polarised, which means it radiates most of its energy in one 'plane' relative to the antenna. For maximum efficiency, the transmit and receive antenna should be orientated such that their plane of radiation is the same, or very close to.

It is important to note that as the aircraft flies around, the orientation of the antenna changes with the aircraft. The reason a vertical orientation is recommended is that aircraft - particularly multirotors - generally1 fly with one side 'up'; therefore, for whichever direction the aircraft is travelling the antenna is still vertical (or, mostly so) compared with the transmitter.

With a horizontally orientated antenna, when the aircraft turns through 90° relative to the transmitter, the antenna is now 90° out of alignment to the transmitter; it may help to think of/visualise this as ""North/South"" and ""East/West"", and the loss of signal will be comparable to vertical vs. horizontal as the angle difference is the same. Some receivers have multiple antennas and recommend orientating them at 90° to each other to mitigate this scenario.

What you may consider, if your transmitter permits it, is to have the antenna at a 45° angle as a compromise for signal strength. Most drones have a built-in lost comms failsafe so a loss of signal should not be a huge concern; for a fixed-wing model aircraft, I would be more concerned about matching antenna orientations.

For the best signal when flying a drone that has a horizontally mounted Crossfire antenna, should I also rotate the transmitter antenna horizontal to match, or is it better to keep it vertical regardless?

It would be great to understand the logic either way as well. Thanks!

"In my experience, the causes of this problem are (in order of probability )


One or more propellers are on wrong.  
One or more motors are spinning in the wrong direction.
Flight controller orientation is wrong (mounted facing the wrong direction)
Motor order is wrong (ie. physical location of motors 1-4 does not match up with what the flight controller expects )


How to solve :

Issue 1.  On standard rotation quads (props in) the Front Left and Back Right props should create thrust when spinning clockwise.  Front Right and Back Left counterclockwise.  Make sure the props will create a downward thrust when spun in their corresponding directions.

Issue 2.  On standard rotation quads you will need to spin up each individual motor (eg in Betaflight configurator) and make sure it is spinning the proper direction.  See Issue 1. for which direction that should be.  To do this take off any propellers, connect to Betaflight and plug in a battery.  Go the Motors tab in Betaflight and read the warning and click the ""props are off"" slider.  Now slightly move up the slider for motor 1-4 one at a time and feel with your hand for proper direction.  If you find a motor going the wrong direction make a note of which one it is (there might be more than 1).  To change the direction of any motor use BLHeli configurator for BLheliS ESCs and BLheli Suite for BLHeli32 ESCs.  Google search this for more details on how to reverse the motor direction.  Alternatively, you can swap any two motor wires at the ESC connection to change the direction.  

This post has a very detailed explanation and diagrams What process should I use to ensure my motors are spinning the correct direction when using Betaflight

Issue 3:  Look on your flight controller for an arrow pointing in a certain direction.  It should be pointing to the front of the quad. If it is not then this is probably your issue.  You can also confirm this issue by connecting your FC configurator (eg Betaflight) and looking at the setup screen where you should see a 3d model of a quad that moves around when you physically move the quad around.  If the movement of 3d model doesn't match how you move the physical quad then you have an alignment issue.  To fix you can either physically rotate the FC so that the arrow points forward or you can set a board rotation in the Betaflight configuration page.

Issue 4:  To figure out if this is your issue, follow the motor spinning steps in the solution for Issue 2.  When spinning up a motor, make sure it's physical location matches the motor map picture in your configurator.  In Betaflight the order should be 1: Back Right, 2: Front Right, 3; Back Left, 4: Front Left.  If you move the slider for motor 1 and the Front right motor spins, you have a motor order problem.  This can happen if using a 4in1 ESC and two of the motor signal wires got swapped or if the ESC has a motor order that doesn't match what Betaflight expects.  The easiest way to fix is to change the motor signal wires so that the order is correct.

"Most forces in aerodynamics are proportional to area, speed squared, air density and a 'coefficient' that describes how efficient your object is. There's also usually a 1/2 for obscure theoretical reasons.

If you work in metric, the density of air at sea level is basically 1, which takes that out of the equation.

The maximum lift coefficient of an average wing is roughly 1. The drag coefficient of a non-aerodynamic object is also (very) roughly 1 (see link for examples), so for a first approximation, we'll use 1.

Now you've got to guess the maximum speed of your model, maybe by multiplying the motor Kv, battery voltage and prop pitch.

That should give you the maximum force on the control surface. We've no idea how it's distributed but we'll assume it's in the middle. Multiply the force by half the chord to get the torque.

Then allow for differences in the length of control horns. If they're the same, the servo needs the calculated torque. If the servo horn is half as long as the control surface horn, the servo will only need half the torque. 

Finally, double or triple that value to give yourself a safety factor.

Alternately, just copy a similar model.

Then when you test fly, don't try any high-speed dives until after you'd tried a level full speed pass. If the controls feel sluggish at speed, you need larger servos.
",How to determine the correct specification of servo for a control surface,"Servos come in a large range of sizes, torque values, etc. and the servo to use depends on a number of factors such as control surface size, aircraft speed and desired manoeuvrability.

"As a designer and manufacturer of frames here's my experience (6+ years, 10,000 flights, FPV only, 107 pilot w/HAM)

True-X: If you build well and balance your load these will fly in a symmetrical fashion on roll/pitch. If you set your rotation to 900 degree/sec (my normal) then roll and pitch (freestyle) will be similar in duration, stick movement, and hand-eye.  Generally the best to learn on as a point of reference.
Squished-X: (lateral x) I fly a few of these, they have a &quot;float&quot; and just like the stretch-x they are slightly different - but not much. I use this layout for our high-resolution filming work, great for sliding pans and holding a line.
Stretch-X: I don't fly these too much anymore. I found no advantage for my flight style (all freestyle FPV, no racing).
Deadcat: Flies like a lateral-x in my opinion.

Other factors beyond frame shape influence performance. ESC on arms versus AIO is huge as you move weight around and change the inertial mass (resistance to acceleration).  The same is true of distribution of arm mass. Stack hight is also important.
If you are a new pilot lean towards pure-x.
In general the frame contributes around 10% of the final flight feel. Electronics, tuning, weight, weight distribution, drive train (motor+prop), battery size/type, battery mounting, and your skill in construction are all as important as the frame.
I can change KV by 10% and swap props and get 20x different flight than changing out arm ratio.

"The core idea regarding the accelerometer is the following:
if you take any flight of an object and calculate the average experienced acceleration over the whole flight (ignoring gravity as a factor for a second), that average should add up to zero. Here I'm assuming that the velocity at the beginning and end of the flight is the same, which is usually the case: the drone powers on while still and powers down also while still. If you add acceleration due to gravity back in, then that will be the average: g + 0 = g.
Additionally, most utilitarian/autonomous drones spend most of their time hovering or moving in a straight line at a constant velocity, during which there is also almost zero measured acceleration besides the gravitational component.
Of course, while the aircraft is actively maneuvering, the acceleration readings will be way off and can't be trusted for getting an accurate attitude(=orientation) estimate.
However, the IMU has two different kinds of sensors; in addition to the accelerometers it also has three solid-state gyroscopes built in, which measure angular velocity (rotation rates) directly. Those rates can be integrated to get the current orientation very accurately in the short term. In fact, gyroscope-based attitude readings are actually the main source of attitude information for any aircraft, and accelerometer-based readings are secondary.
The biggest problem with gyroscopes is error accumulation: since their readings are being integrated (i.e. added together) and every sensor has a small persistent error, the errors add up over time and  and in the long run the accumulated error can become quite large.
To get the best of both worlds, you could, through a process called sensor fusion, combine data from both of those systems into one &quot;fused&quot; measurement that is accurate both in the short and long term.
There are multiple different sensor fusion algorithms in use; Arguably the most popular ones are the Kalman filter and the Madgwick filter. Both involve high-level math, but the basic idea could be approximated this way: at each step, you take the current gyro-based measurement and correct it a tiny bit towards the current accelerometer-based measurement. This way the gyro integration error is being constantly compensated and doesn't grow, and the accelerometer-based error can't throw the measurement off too much at any given moment since the corrections based on it are small.
All that said, if you do maneuver a lot, the algorithm can be fooled. If you turn on the respective feature on a betaflight quad, fly several minutes of hard freestyle and then turn on angle mode, the quad is likely to tilt hard to one side and think that's the upright orientation. So that (in addition to energy conservation and simplicity) is another reason why autonomous drones tend to fly in a straight line most of the time, and also why some acro pilots turn off the accelerometer entirely on their drones.
Other sensor fusion algorithms can be used for different kinds of readings: for instance one could fuse GPS readings with accelerometer readings and get a position estimate that is more accurate than GPS (because the IMU has better resolution) but doesn't drift (because GPS readings compensate for it) and can continue to function if the GPS fails in flight for some reason.

"This comes with an understanding of how the PID algorithm works and what it actually does. Bardwell videos can be good, but non-quadcopter reference on what a PID controller is will be the best way to visualize this.

Look at the individual P, I, D components, and see how they react to the gyros. A properly damped (critically damped) system is what you're aiming for.

"There are multiple ways to enable servos in BetaFlight, but since you need only one servo it is recommended to use SERVO_TILT.



For servo to work you need a free pin on your board and this pin must have timer function.


Go to Configuration tab in Betaflight Configurator and enable SERVO_TILT and hit ""Save and Reboot""

Then setup the switch you want to use on your transmitter and in Betaflight. Let's say it was AUX4. Make sure it shows in the Receiver tab and that the signal is received.
Then go to the CLI tab and type resource (resource list for older BF) and hit Enter.
What you're looking for is resources with MOTOR or PWM function. For example on my board there are 6 MOTOR outputs. I assume you fly 4-motors copter and you also have some spare MOTOR pads.
You need to remember the MCU pin and MOTOR number and of an output you want to use (C09 and MOTOR 5 for me).

Then you need to type:
resource MOTOR 5 NONE
resource SERVO 1 C09
save
Use your own MOTOR and MCU pin number instead of 5 and C09!
This will remap MOTOR5 pad to be able to work with PWM Servos.
Servos numbering in CLI starts from 1  
After reboot you can go to the CLI tab and type resource again to make sure everything worked as expected.

Go to the Servos tab in Configurator and hit the checkbox with with your AUX channel on Servo 0 row (AUX4 for me).  If you can't see the servos tab check ""Enable Expert Mode"" on the top right.
Save.
Servo numbering on the Servos page starts from 0. So Servo 1 from CLI tab is Servo 0 here.  





You can now power on transmitter and enable the live mode on the Servos tab.
Go to the Motors tab (remove props if you have LiPo connected!). There are servos output there.
If you switch the switch you set to AUX channel you should see Servo 1 output to change the value.


Now you've remapped MOTOR 5 pad to act as a servo output. You can connect your servo's signal wire to it and find any spare +5V and ground pads for it.
If the servo moves automatically as the quadcopter moves check that the CAMSTAB mode is disabled. The screenshot below shows it active, which you won't want if trying to manually control the servo. 




If you don't have any spare MOTOR or PWM pad you can remap LED_STRIP 1 resource if you're not using it for LED.
Here's the guide how you can do this: https://youtu.be/jiD6aC0l1VQ

"If you have the technical know how, I would suggest you remove the shell from the drone and spray paint that separately to avoid contamination any of the electronics or mechanical components.

If you aren’t able to do that, then apply masking tape and/or plastic or any other protective layer over any exposed electronics, cameras, ports, motors etc. Basically anything functional. Also make sure not to point the propellers as this could lead to them being unbalanced.

Before you paint the drones, you may want to scuff the surface with some sand paper. This will provide better adhesion for the paint - if you’ve ever tried writing in marker on a smooth surface, you know how difficult it is to stick.

After you have applied your paint, you can add a clear coat and a fixative to protect the paint.

"These four wires are most likely a USB connection, red and black are power, and the other two are USB data. That means you can't use it neither with today's analog gear, like the VTX that you linked to (as it requires an oldschool analog TV signal), nor any of the new and shiny digital FPV systems, like the DJI system (as they use their own proprietary protocols). 

However, you can use it for flying if you really want or need it — you just need a computer on your drone that can process the video feed, such as a Raspberry Pi, and some kind of digital wireless connection, such as WiFi or even 4G to stream that feed to your phone or computer on the ground. That's how a lot of commercial drones work, and you can build something similar yourself. 

Whether you really need or want it is another question. Using such a setup for the ""sporty"" kind of FPV flying, i.e. racing or freestyle, is probably a bad idea, as the latency will be very high, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds if not more. Such systems are more suited for long range and autonomous craft, which generally fly themselves (and sometimes even do some onboard analysis of the video feed), or just as a not necessarily practical but fun-to-make project to prove to yourself how cool of a hacker you are (or as part of such a project, like a facial-recognition patrol drone or whatever).

"Okay, as someone who has just recently passed through this stage, here's my take on it. Almost all of the considerations below stem from the maxim that the best drone for you is one that you will fly the most. Both progression and enjoyment in this hobby (and many other hobbies as well) are directly linked to how much time you spend doing it. Whenever you're unsure about a decision, besides other considerations ask yourself which option will keep you in the air more.

Now, to the list itself. Your ""second"" drone must be:


Indestructible. Durability is valuable for all quadcopters intended for acrobatic or racing flying, and you'll likely never stop bashing your drone into stuff no matter how high your skill, but unlike the pro pilots who probably break more drones a month than you will ever own, you don't have spares lying all over the place for when you do. For a long time, this is likely going to be the only ""real"" drone you'll own, so it better be durable. There are two main ways you can achieve that: 


The ""classic"" approach is to have massive unbreakable arms, a titanium cage around the components, etc. That's pretty self-explanatory, though you'll have to pay for it in added weight (which is not that bad if you don't carry a gopro).
The other way is for the drone to be so light that it simply doesn't
have enough inertia to break anything, including itself or even its
own props. This is the idea behind the ""toothpick"" class of
quadcopters, which some consider an excellent choice for
beginner-intermediate pilots, in part for this reason.

Basic, but high-quality. What I mean by that is that you don't need the fanciest F-infinity processors, top-end performance motors, the lowest-latency camera, etc. What you do need, however, is for all the components to be high-quality and well-built by a reputable manufacturer. i.e. an F4 FC made by a well-regarded manufacturer is better than an F7 FC by a knockoff noname brand. Not only will this reduce your cost (by picking basic components) and add to reliability (by picking trusted brands), it will also make things simpler for you and less heartbreaking when you do break something.
Easy to maintain. However durable your drone, you will crash it, break something and need to fix or replace it eventually. And when it happens, you'll want your drone to be easy to disassemble and reassemble, have replaceable parts, etc. First, this rules out the non-DIY type of drones, but the DIY ones are also not created equal. Some frames make accessing the guts as easy as unscrewing three bolts, while others need more disassembly. A bigger drone is significantly easier to work on, with less tiny fiddly parts, while a small one (3"" and smaller), while frustrating to work on at times, will likely break less. For larger (5 inch +) frames, replaceable arms are a very good feature to have, and a simple replace procedure (i.e. unscrewing one bolt versus disassembling the whole frame) is important as well. Toothpicks are an interesting class in that regard, in that they have a tiny whoop-like architecture, with only 4 parts: the frame, motors, camera, and an all-in-one FC+ESC+VTX board which the motors just plug into with pin connectors. This makes them way easier to maintain than other quads of this size, but also less upgradable, since three of the main components are on one board. Which brings us to...
Upgradable. This is closely related to the previous point, but slightly different. You want to be able to swap any of the major parts of the drone (FC, ESC, motors, camera, VTX, frame, etc.) for a different or better model without also having to swap the others or encountering any compatibility issues. This is mainly a jab at some prebuilt quads that have proprietary components in them which would not work well or at all with other off-the-shelf components.
Fit for your usual flying location. This is actually important for any quad, but as this one is likely to be the only one for some time, here it is especially important. The best quadcopter is one that you fly a lot, and so you want yours to be well-suited for the size, configuration, weather conditions and other considerations at the place where you fly the most, as this will maximize your flying time, frequency of flight sessions and enjoyment of the process, all very important contributing factors to how fast you learn and how much you enjoy the hobby. If you buy ""the best-flying"" copter but it won't fit in your flying field, you won't fly it much at all. The most important parameter here is likely the size class of your copter, which must fit the size of your location. Loosely, it's something like this:


if you mostly fly indoors, you need a tiny whoop (although it's likely you'll later want a separate outdoors quad anyway)
for a playground/backyard-sized outdoors location with lots of small obstacles (i.e. literally a children's playground) and gaps a larger (75-85) brushless whoop or ~2 inch quadcopter with detachable propguards will offer the most
enjoyment out of flying in such a tight space while still being able to rip in larger locations.
For something like an uncrowded street, large backyard or small park a toothpick-class 2.5 to 3 inch quad would be optimal; 
for larger parks you can go either the toothpick or the 4-5 inch route, depending on how crowded the place is; the former is safer for everyone, less intimidating, and slightly slower, while 4-5 inch quads are noisy, heavy and can do some damage, but are still the undisputed leaders when it comes to flight performance.
finally, if you've got huge fields, shorelines or even mountains to fly over, you probably want a 5 or even 6 inch quadcopter that is able to cover the distance well. However don't fly too far without educating yourself on proper long-range operation first, there's a lot of stuff that you need to know (and buy :) in order to not lose your precious quad a couple km away in the first few flights.

Of the quadcopters that fit all the previous points, choose (or build) the one that you like the most subjectively. Maybe it looks cool, maybe you really like the manufacturer, maybe it's elegant. The factor of likability should not be underestimated. Whatever the reason for you to love the quad, the more you do, the more love, time and effort you'll put into it, making it a better quad and you a better pilot!


As a final word, I must reiterate. Whichever quad you pick, in the end the most important thing is that you fly a lot. Buy a good amount of batteries, a nice flight backpack, and make a habit out of going out and flying. You'll love every moment of it and of the rest of your life as well.

"There are a few differences:

Firstly, the F7 chip used in F7 flight controllers operates at a much higher frequency, so can handle more operations per second.

This is useful when you want to start adding lots of dynamic filters, for example RPM filtering, alongside features such as antigravity.

Whilst an F4 can handle almost anything you will want to throw at it in this respect, it will not be able to do so forever (the F3 used to be standard but is now lacking features). Therefore, F7 is better for future proofing.

F7 flight controllers also have extra UARTs. This can be very useful if you want lots of extra features, for example SmartPort telemetry, Smart Audio, GPS and camera control. However, it is not the end of the world if you don’t have as many UARTs as you want as you can use softserial to add software UARTs to your FC. Of course, this also takes up processing power so an F7 may cope better.

Finally, F7 flight controllers have built in inverters on their UART ports, while F4's do not. So an F7 FC can handle any inverted signal ""as is"" on any of its numerous UARTs, while F4 flight controllers have a dedicated external inverter chip on the PCB connected to one of the UARTs. 

Because of that, F7's make it easier to use UARTs for SBUS or other inverted signals as it means you can hook them up anywhere without any inversion mods, while on an F4 controller you can only use the special inverted pads (of which there is usually only one, labeled ""SBUS"").

"Gain, as a general term, is a measure of how large or strong something (a voltage, a radio wave, a sound wave, or whatever else) is relative to some baseline value of the thing being measured. A gain is a ratio: If a device takes a voltage on one end and makes it 20x larger (amplifies) it 20-fold, it has a gain of 20. In practice they are represented using decibels, a special unit that makes it easy to work with very large or small ratios. See the note at the end of this answer for more information about them.
Consequently, the gain of an antenna is the ratio of how much stronger the radio waves generated by the antenna are, relative to those generated by a standard &quot;reference antenna&quot; when fed by the same signal.
This reference antenna used as a baseline is considered to have a gain of 0 dB, or 1:1 (equal to itself).
The reference antenna is usually one of two types: An ideal isotropic antenna, which radiates equally in all directions with zero losses, or a dipole antenna. To indicate which one is used as the baseline, a letter is added to the end: dBi represents gain relative to an isotropic antenna, and dBd relative to a dipole.
The dipole itself has a gain of 2.15 dBi (and 0 dBd), so to convert a dBi gain to a dBd gain you subtract 2.15 from it, or add the same number to convert the other way around.
Symmetry
Every antenna receives the same way as it transmits, so an antenna's reception gain (how strong of an electric signal is generated in it by a radio wave, relative to the chosen reference antenna) is always the same as its transmission gain.
An antenna with 3 dB (2x) gain in a certain direction will transmit 2x the power in that direction, but also radio waves coming from this direction will generate 2x stronger signals for a connected receiver to detect.
If an antenna's gain is 13 dBd (a 20:1 ratio), its signal will be 20 times as strong as a dipole's (and its reception will be 20x stronger as well)! Wonderful, right?
Well, there is a caveat to high gain, and it basically boils down to: There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
Gain and directionality
True isotropic antennae do not exist in the real world, i.e. no real antenna radiates equally strong in all directions. There are directions in which it will radiate the strongest, and others in which it doesn't radiate at all. So the gain of a real antenna is not the same in all directions either: in some it is stronger, in some it is weaker. The easiest way to show this is a graph showing the antenna’s gain in every direction around the antenna. That graph is called a radiation pattern and looks like this:

The bold line represents the gain: the further it is from the center, the bigger the gain. Above is the radiation pattern of a directional antenna: the gain in one direction is a lot more than in other directions.
So when we speak of an antenna's gain, we really mean its gain in a certain direction. And that direction is usually the one in which the antenna's gain is the strongest.
Also, you can't get more out of an antenna than you put into it. The sum of all power radiated in all directions is always equal to the power that goes in (Minus a small percentage of losses); Antennae create gain by radiating this power such that the created waves add up in the preferred direction and cancel in others.
So if an antenna has a higher than baseline (positive) gain in some direction, you pay for that by having a negative gain in other directions. Gain only focuses power — it does not create power.
For our imaginary 13 dBd antenna it means that only a small sector will get this much gain, and all the other directions will have almost zero radiated power to make up for it.
So gain is not only the measure of how well an antenna receives or transmits, it's also a measure of the antenna's directivity: If the antenna focuses all of its power in a tight cone, it will have a huge gain within that cone, and a huge gain rating on the box... But its gain outside of that cone will be almost nonexistent. So when you are choosing a directional antenna, the gain is also an indication how directional it really is. Lower-gain patch antennae will give you a soft, forgiving cone but lower gain in it, while high-gain directionals will have a very tight zone in which they could transmit or receive at all, but within it they will be super powerful.
Omnidirectional antennae (which, as you now know, are never truly omnidirectional) have a radiation pattern that's more or less shaped like a donut:

They have an equal (and positive) gain in any direction perpendicular to the antenna, which gets lower as the direction gets closer to parallel to the antenna. These antennae also have their own kind of directivity: if you mount the antenna vertically, the &quot;horizontal&quot; gain will be the same in any direction, but it can be higher or lower relative to the &quot;more vertical&quot; directions, making the donut flatter. In other words, the antenna can prioritize gain towards the horizon versus overhead gain more or less.

A note on decibels
In many engineering fields ratios can easily get extremely large or extremely minuscule and tend to multiply a lot. Radio is one of the most prominent of those. At the input to a receiver, signals are frequently
smaller than one ten-billionth of a watt. When they come out of a transmitter, they’re often measured in kilowatts! Antennas, propagation and electronic circuits change signal strengths by many factors of ten.
To manage these vast differences in value, engineers measure ratios in decibels, or dB, which represent the ratio of
two quantities as a power of 10. The formula for computing decibels is:
dB = 10 * log_10 (ratio)
This is a logarithmic unit, meaning that when two ratios are multiplied, their representations in dB are simply added up: 10 decibels represent a ratio of 10:1; 20 dB is 1010=100:1, and 30dB is 1010*10=1000:1.
Positive values of dB mean the ratio is greater than 1 and negative values of dB indicate a ratio of less than 1: -10 dB represents a ratio of 1/10, and 40dB is 1/10000.
Here's a quick cheat sheet of dB to actual ratio for numbers smaller than 10:

1dB corresponds to about 1.25:1

3dB is almost exactly 2:1 (this is the most important one to remember)

7dB ~= 5:1

10dB is 10:1 (exactly)
For everything else, you just add up the numbers you know:

6dB (=3dB+3dB) is ~ 4(=2*2):1, and 9dB is ~ 8:1

13 dB is 10 dB + 3 dB, so 10*2=20:1.

46 dB is 40 dB + 6 dB = 10^4 * 4 = 40000:1

15 dB is 10dB + 5dB; and 5 dB is somewhere between 3dB and 6dB (2 and 4), so it's probably three point something. Thus our guess would be 15dB is somewhere in the 30-35 to 1 range.

"Background

Stiffness, oscillation, and vibration damping are separate concepts but all somewhat relevant to the question. Each affects flight dynamics, and each is (somewhat) a function of material choice. 

For example, titanium is very stiff, and it rings like a bell. CF is very stiff, but it rings like mud. Aluminum is in between.

Stiffness

Stiffness is a good thing when you don't want your structure to be compliant[*]. Stiffness means that the frame isn't deflecting, which is important for the presumed laws of motion. Put another way, a quadcopter's autopilot assumes that all the motors are pointed in a fixed direction[**]. If those directions change, i.e. because of flexing, then the most fundamental assumptions of its flight dynamics are false. It's no surprise flight flight performance degrades!

Of course, any structure will bend/deflect/twist under load, no matter how stiff. What's important is whether it does any of these sufficiently enough to compromise your flight goal. If you're trying to do telescopic videography then a little bit of error is immediately visible in the results. If you're learning to fly, then so long as the autopilot keeps things sunny-side up you're fine.

Oscillation

Oscillation, such as control-surface flutter, occur when the  entire structure starts deforming like a spring. This can dramatically build up and quickly rip the airframe to shreds. (It really is that fast, that violent, and that scary.)

If a quad's arms are insufficiently damped, oscillations can occur. Most frequently, it will occur as a twist about the arm axis, but I've also seen it happen in the flapping direction. Because of differences in dynamics between a multirotor and a fixed-wing, it's unlikely that your quad will suffer inflight failure but it's also very hard to keep control, both for you and the autopilot. 

The closer you get to instability, the more energy you have to expend to keep things stable. In the case of a multi, at the very least this translates into decreased flight time.

The more powerful your input (e.g. a powerful quadcopter), the easier it is to drive a system past a critical damping threshold. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was famous for this when the wind  was blowing and the bridge was slightly wet. More recently, these out of control harmonic oscillations have famously been seen on the Millennium Bridge in London (surprisingly due to human footfall) and the Humen Perl River Bridge in China (heavy winds).

A full discussion of how to control oscillation is outside the scope of this answer. However, it is relevant to note that some materials are springier than others, and these materials are the ones more likely to have pathological  oscillation.

Vibration

Vibration is a form of oscillation, but I'm breaking it out so I can specifically address how it affects sensor data. Vibration is an issue when it causes signal integrity issues with the IMU (i.e. accelerometer + gyrometer)[***]. This can confuse the autopilot, leading it to make incorrect estimations of the aircraft's roll-pitch-yaw, and as a result respond inappropriately. This can and does cause crashes.

Again, a full discussion of how to control vibration is outside the scope of this answer. And once again, the springier the material is, the more it is likely to have pathological vibration.

Composites vs. metals

Composites (e.g. carbon fiber, fiberglass, kevlar, ...) have what are called anisotropic properties. This means that they don't have the same properties in all directions. Consider a square sheet of aluminum. No matter which axis you pull it on, it has the same strength, stiffness, heat transfer, etc... This is isotropic.

Now consider the same sheet made out of unidirectional carbon fiber. Along the carbon fiber axis it's incredibly strong. But turned 90 degrees, where the only thing holding it together is the glue, you'll find that it has no strength whatsoever.

You would be correct in assuming that this difference in properties extends to oscillation and vibration. The upshot is that composites can be tricky to chose because two seemingly similar structures (e.g. a tube) can have very different properties.

"Running a receiver without an antenna should not cause any damage to the receiver, as no RF power is sent to the antenna (if your receiver has an active antenna there may be a DC bias present, but this does not cause problems - you will often see this in GPS receivers.)
However, for completeness, it is worth noting that some modern RC receivers actually do transmit, to send telemetry and other data back to the controller; in this case 'receiver' is a misnomer, used to mean &quot;the radio part in the aircraft&quot; - and it is possible for damage to occur. The correct term would be 'transceiver', a portmanteau of 'transmitter' and 'receiver'.
The reason a transmitter can be damaged when run without an antenna is because the power sent to the antenna has nowhere to go. When a (matched) antenna is connected, the power is transferred to the antenna but without it the energy is reflected back down the transmission line to the output transistors. These transistors are not designed to handle that much power coming back, and can fail. The likelihood of this happening generally increases with transmit power, but it also depends on the rating of the output transistors so this is just a crude approximation.
(Transmission line theory deviates somewhat from the normal models of power transfer, where having nowhere for the power to go would create an open circuit, and no current flows.)

"This type of connector is called a U.FL connector.

Replacing the connectors will be super fiddly, but is possible if you are skilled with a soldering iron. The cable side is the more difficult bit but also cheaper, so you might try a new antenna and replace just the PCB connector.

You may be able to use something small, like a pin, to carefully nudge the connector back into shape - it may make it worse, but if it doesn't work anyway what's to lose?!

Finally, you could unsolder the connector from the board, cut the wire and solder it directly. The wire will be a coaxial cable, so you need to take care not to short the inner to the outer - especially when soldering as you may melt the insulator away. The inner goes to the centre pin on the connector; the outer part to ground (the circle of the U.FL connector is connected to ground so you can use this pad).

Before you trust the receiver again you should do some range tests. You can put the transmitter in the range testing mode and check what kind of range you get.

"I run a small MultiGP chapter, so things are slightly more relaxed in our chapter compared to some of the big chapters. But here are the official MultiGP rules for pilots:


Fly only in designated areas.
Fly only at appropriate times.
Keep your multirotor at least (30) feet away from the pilot area. Flying any closer can
cause your video transmitter to interfere with other pilot’s reception.
When finishing a race, land ON the course (at least 30 feet away from the pilot area)
When flying on the course, you must be positioned within the designated Pilot Area.
DO NOT fly from any other area.
Only power up your multirotor/video transmitter while in the Start/Finish area on the course. DO NOT
power up in the pits or while walking from the pits to the course
If you need to check your video channel or change frequency, this MUST be completed between heats. You
MUST also ensure you have the appropriate Frequency Card for the frequency you wish to check.
If you are flying before or after the event you MUST ensure you have the appropriate Frequency Card for the
frequency you are using.
You MUST ensure you have a Spotter in the Pilot Area while flying. A Spotter observes the course for
dangers such as members of public, animals, other model fliers, low flying aircraft or vehicles. Spotters
stand in the Pilot Area to ensure clear communication.
You should help with spotting for the heat before yours.


And some more rules we incorporate:


If video channels are assigned ahead of time, be sure to show up with all of your drones set to that channel (though changing after arriving is not unusual).
All transmitters (video and remote) should be set to 25mW to prevent someone knocking others out the air.
Never enter the race coarse unless the safety officer gives you permission. But keep an eye out for people who might fly during inappropriate times.

"The trick is speed. The reason why multirotors don't lose (very much) altitude while performing quick mid-air aerobatics is because of the speed of the move and the skillful management of throttle by the pilot.

You're correct in presuming that a multirotor performs a flip by changing the speed of the motors on each side of the craft. Freestyle pilots usually make use of near-total stick deflection and extreme rate profiles targeting ~600-1200 deg/s of angular velocity. The fact that the flight controller speeds up motors on the side which needs to rotate ""up"" and slowing down those on the side which needs to rotate ""down"" ensures that the move occurs as fast as possible because all four motors contribute to the torque which rotates the multirotor.

The other factor which helps the multirotor not descend too much is the skillful management of the throttle during the move. By lowering the throttle to near idle while the craft is inverted, the pilot minimizes the amount of thrust the craft generates which acts to pull it down towards the ground. As I discuss in my answer to ""What's the purpose of airmode and idle up?"", the idle up and airmode features (of the RC transmitter and flight controller respectively) help ensure that the multirotor is in control during these times of low-throttle.

Because of these two factors, the duration in which gravity has the power to suck the craft towards the ground is often too little to matter, and the multirotor flips in-place.

Of course, there's nothing preventing you as the pilot from slowing down the flip and performing an ""O""-shaped loop instead of a flip in-place. This can be done by easing off the roll/pitch axis and turning down rate profiles.

"I'm going to give you the answer first:
Yes, it is worth calculating the approximate range if you're building a (very) long-range aircraft. However, theoretical calculations will usually be such a crude approximation of reality that you can't rely on them, and the actual maximum range will depend on a myriad of factors besides what you can consider in the approximation. 

If you're flying short-range, near obstacles (or inside of them!), doing acrobatic maneuvers, etc, the local conditions, attitude of your drone, its proximity to things, etc at each particular moment will affect the performance of your video link orders of magnitude more than any theoretical range. Things such as where your antennae are pointed and how directional they are, what kind of noise reduction your receiver has, and where you are standing suddenly become extremely important and intimately connected to the configuration of the building or other environment that you're flying. Sometimes, just moving your receiver several centimeters to the side could make a huge difference in the clarity of the received signal, or lowering your transmitter's power can make the link perform better due to less multipath interference.

So what people usually do is they have some known values of range and general performance for certain combinations of gear, and they consider how much a certain change to that gear will affect this performance. As in, swapping a 3dB antenna for an 11dB option might give you an 8dB stronger signal, which corresponds to 4dB (~2.5x) more range in open air versus the alternative under the same conditions; or it might give you the ability to punch through that wall (while your less-directional omni antenna covers the rest of your surroundings). Maybe upping the VTX power twofold could give you sqrt(2)=1.41x more range even through that wall. Or it might give you more interference instead. So after making that hypothesis, you implement the change, go and test it and see if it really works this way; It might or it might not!



Okay, now comes the nerdy part.

I don't know the exact formula you're speaking about, but I'm going to reason my way through this just for kicks.

So, our goal is to have a signal at the receiver that's higher than its sensitivity (which represents the weakest signal that the receiver can detect and demodulate). Our signal path is as follows: 

Original signal -&gt; transmitter's amplifier gain -&gt; (feedline loss) -&gt; TX antenna gain -&gt; path loss from travel between antennas -&gt; RX antenna gain -&gt; (preamp?) -&gt; receiver.


(scroll it).

The signal is multiplied at every step except where it is reduced while traveling through the air, so we need the product of all gains multiplied by the loss factor to be higher than the sensitivity.

So our max-range equation is:

AmpGain*Gain1*Gain2*PathLoss = RxSens.


In the simplest, ideal case, where we assume that there's nothing around except the two antennas (free space), the losses from transmission are inverse-square: 
FSPL = wavelength/(4Pi * distance²), from which we get:

AllGains*wavelength/(4Pi * Distance²) = RxSens;
4Pi * Distance² = AllGains*wavelength/RxSens;
MaxDistance = sqrt(AllGains*wavelength/(4Pi*RxSens)).


And here comes the caveat. 

We don't live in an ideal world.

We're not transmitting in free space. There might be buildings or trees or rain or anything else in the way, too. Worse, it doesn't even have to block your line of sight, as objects near the line will cause diffraction of your signal which can interfere with your reception if they are within the fresnel zone. The ground itself will often be the biggest source of such interference at larger distances, sometimes reducing the propagation factor to an effective inverse-fourth-power law. 



Also, consider that the max-gain vectors of your antennas are not always pointed at each other; while you can use an antenna-pointing device on the ground, your aircraft will pitch and roll, reducing the transmitting antenna's gain in your direction. 

The earth's atmosphere can affect your signal significantly as well, and it will do so differently each day, both in terms of how much and in terms of how.

For all of those factors, while you can predict roughly how they are going to affect your range, there's a lot of things about them in each particular location and at each particular time that you simply don't know. And since signal-modifying factors stack by multiplying, the discrepancy can get pretty big pretty fast.



Your receiver isn't ideal, either. It will probably start to corrupt the signal in various ways as you approach its sensitivity level. You're unlikely to ever see this, however, because long before it reaches that critical stat of your receiver, your precious signal will drown in...

Noise.

Noise is the worst enemy of anyone working with high-gain systems. It's the third law of thermodynamics personified. Thousands of manmade and natural radiation sources around the planet bombard everything around with random radio waves. Even if you exclude those, outer space is actually quite noisy as well. Your receiver itself generates noise internally; in fact, for most gear including your receiver sensitivity itself is defined by that internal noise level. Still, external noise tends to be orders of magnitude more powerful, and whatever the source, you don't want any of it.

The total strength of noise as received by your gear is called the noise floor, and that floor is lava. No matter how sensitive the receiver, the moment your signal level dips below the noise floor, it's gone: still out there, but you can't tell it apart from the noise to decode it properly anymore.



Depending on the nature of your signal, it can even become totally unintelligible before it reaches the noise floor, at several dB above it. Usually, the higher a signal's bandwidth (which is closely linked to data transmission rate), the sooner it's overcome by noise. Some advanced digital transmission modes can extract a message from well under the noise floor, but in order to do that they transmit several bytes per minute. 

Video is a notoriously high-bandwidth type of data, both in the internet and in radio. Analog video especially so, as it has zero compression. So it gets disrupted by noise rather easily. On the other hand, zero compression implies lots of redundancy in the data, and redundancy allows for error correction. Do you know what's one of the best signal processing and error correction machines in the world? The human brain! Even when a video signal is almost entirely eaten up by static, we can still see shapes in it. So for video, the intelligibility threshold seems to be just at the noise floor mark, give or take a couple dB.

You can fight noise in various ways. Usually, if most of it is coming from certain sources on the ground, just using a directional antenna helps by attenuating signals from unwanted directions. Sometimes, if the noise is just the regular background entropy kind, it doesn't. A good frequency selectivity of your receiver (i.e. its ability to ignore signals that aren´t the target frequency) also helps tremendously. 

An interesting way of fighting noise is signal-stacking, as done by receivers like RapidFire or True-D X: Instead of simply switching to the antenna with the highest signal, they use signals from both and merge them into one. Since the useful signal is the same and noise is random, the signal adds up while the noise mostly cancels out. Astrophotographers use the same technique to get stunning clear pictures of the sky, except that they have to stack hundreds of extremely noisy photos. The digital communication modes I mentioned earlier also work this way by sending multiple copies of the same transmission.



Video is still a high-bandwidth signal, however, and you've only got two copies of it to stack, so the gains from the likes of Rapidfire are far from dramatic, but it'll win you a couple of additional dB over the noise floor. Beware, though: such receivers depend on a special sync signal in the video to do the adding correctly, and when the noise eats that... You'll probably get a blank screen. 
That's a common caveat with any technology that does the error correction for you, by the way, including digital video: it gives a cleaner and more pleasant signal while it does, but will probably give up before you do. So this kind of error correction might not be the best for very long-range flights.

Final word

To appreciate the sheer expanse of outcomes that you might possibly encounter once you start pushing the range envelope, it's probably best to look at ham radio operators. 
On one end, they will casually use 50-watt transmitters to just talk locally within a range of no more than several tens of kilometers, and sometimes use kilowatts to punch through unfavorable conditions. On the other end, they can literally talk to the other side of the earth on fractions of a watt and bounce signals off of the Moon. They've been doing all of that crazy stuff for decades and had invented things that were thought impossible. 

And the reason for all of those achievements is lots and lots of experimentation. Without testing what works and what doesn't, a theory is useless. So, if you decide to jump down this rabbit hole, start to think like a ham. Make that estimate to the best of your ability, assemble what you think should work best, and then go out and fly it. See how it works in reality, and how it differs from your expectations. Make hypotheses. Go out on different days and in different places to see how the conditions change your outcome. Then change something in your system and see what happens. Write it down. Make your own theory.

And, most important of all,

Have fun!
",Calculating the range of an FPV drone,"It's been a long time since I studied Electronics and Communications Engineering, but if I recall correctly, it should be possible to calculate an estimate for the range of an FPV drone given the transmitter power, the antenna gains of the transmitter and the receiver, the frequency of operation, and the receiver sensitivity.  [I don't have the equation to hand, and my memory isn't what it was, but I'll add it when I find it]



Now, clearly there will be other external factors that might adversely affect the FPV range, so the calculation would only give a 'maximum' range under ideal conditions.  However, with that caveat, it seems to me that it would make sense to use this calculation as part of the design process to help determine the components that will be needed when building an FPV drone.

However, none of the tutorials that I have seen make that calculation, and the expected range is rarely even mentioned when they discuss selecting the components for a drone.  A fairly typical example would be  How to Build an FPV Drone.

"Assuming that you've spec'ed a good propeller-motor match and the heat isn't generated by a tiny motor being forced to drive a giant propeller, the heat generation is likely due to a physical issue with the drone, mistaken filter settings, or a tight PID tune.

First of all, it's a good idea to determine whether your motors are actually hot enough to matter. A good rule of thumb I've heard commonly thrown around is that if your motors are SO hot to the touch that you want to take your fingers off after a few seconds, then that's too hot. If you feel like you could keep them there forever, then it's probably not something that will ever be a problem.

Physical Causes

It's possible that you have a mechanical connection issue somewhere on your drone which is causing problems, like if one of the motor fastener screws is protruding into the motor casing and making contact with the windings like in this video from Joshua Bardwell which also goes through troubleshooting steps and how to rectify the issue.

Other physical causes can include locations on the drone where parts or wires (like motor phase wires) that are touching conductive things they shouldn't be. Giving your drone a look over to make sure any of these aren't the problem is worth a try.

Also, make sure that the hot motor is still balanced. If the motor has been damaged, that is almost certainly the cause of the elevated temperature of the motor.

Filtering Issues

If you ever went into the configurator for your flight controller firmware (e.g. Betaflight, Cleanflight, Raceflight, iNav, etc.) and disabled or restricted the default gyroscope filtering settings, it's possible that these are the culprits. Insufficient filtering on the noisy gyroscope signals can result in hot motors because the flight controller tries to respond to the noise it sees in the gyroscope data and not just the pilot's inputs. The inconsistent nature of the gyro noise means that motor commands would be constantly changing up and down, which can be a cause of hot motors.

If you ever tweaked the filtering settings to try and improve their latency, it's possible that any crashes you've since experienced have beat up the drone sufficiently that there is now extra noise that wasn't there before when you adjusted the filters, causing hot motors. In that case, I'd recommend raising the filter sensitivity. The Betaflight Configurator for >4.0 versions of Betaflight makes this super easy with a slider that you could push towards increased filtering.

PID Tuning Factors

As noted in this (admittedly old, for Betaflight &lt;2.x) Betaflight Tuning Guide, motors will start getting hot if your D-gains are too high. I would recommend checking all of the previous situations before pursuing this case because issues with the PID gains are often more subtle and difficult to track down, but a solution here would be to slowly back off on the D-gains in your PID controller until the motors cool down sufficiently.

The D term in the PID controller tries to look ahead into the future and consider if the controller is trying to reach the pilot's input commands quickly enough, attempting to slow the reaction time or speed it up as necessary to minimize overshoot. This system can be completely screwed up if excess noise enters, so checking the filtering settings to make sure nothing is wrong there first is a good idea.

"When flying in the UK you need to keep your aircraft within 500m horizontally of yourself, below 400ft above ground level and within visual line of sight. If you are able to satisfy these conditions, then you should be able to safely fly the aircraft from your home to the location, take the pictures, and return home.

If, however, you cannot meet these criteria then unfortunately you are unable to complete this flight safely during the lockdown.

Information on UK flying regulations, including distance rules, are available from the Drone Safe website - this is well worth a read, especially the ""Drone code"" page, and knowing this information will help when/if registering as a drone user.

You should also give thought to what you would do if you had an in-flight emergency - if your drone crashes or you have to land away from home, will you be able to recover it?

Edit: You mention in a comment to this question that you live in an apartment building; this complicates things a little more, specifically due to CAP 393 Article 95 which states


  95.—(1) The SUA operator must not cause or permit a small unmanned surveillance aircraft to be  flown  in  any  of  the  circumstances  described  in  paragraph  (2),  and  the  remote  pilot  of  a  small  unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly it in any of those circumstances, except in accordance with a permission issued by the CAA.
  (2) The circumstances referred to in paragraph (1) are—
   (a) over or within 150 metres of any congested area;
   (b) over or within 150 metres of an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons;
   (c) within 50 metres of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the control of the SUA operator or the remote pilot of the aircraft; or
   (d) subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), within 50 metres of any person.
  (3) Subject to paragraph (4), during take-off or landing, a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not be flown within 30 metres of any person.
  (4) Paragraphs  (2)(d)  and  (3)  do not  apply  to  the  remote  pilot  of  the  small  unmanned surveillance aircraft or a  person under the control of the remote pilot of the aircraft.
  (5)In  this  article,  “a small  unmanned surveillance aircraft”  means  a  small  unmanned aircraft which is  equipped to undertake any form of surveillance or data acquisition. (b)

"I'd watch out for several factors:
1. Weight
Drop any additional weight that you don't absolutely need for functioning.  This may mean downsizing to smaller motors, which obviously means that you have to balance weight vs. power; you may be able to get your flight time much longer but at the expense of speed.
2. Battery
Obviously the more juice you got, the longer you can go for.  Again, though it's going to be a balance between the weight of your battery... go for lighter technologies like LiPo.
Also, make sure you've got new batteries on your drone; as your batteries age, they'll lose juice and capacity.
3. Motors
If you really want to increase the flight time... go for lighter less powerful motors.  Of course, you won't be able to go as far, so that may not be a tradeoff you want to make.
4. Weather
Make sure you're flying your drone in dry weather... Condensation or water droplets will both add resistance to any moving parts and weight.  Also, when the weather is well below freezing you'll notice that your batteries will start performing less well, as well as having increased friction.
5. Maintenance
Keep all moving parts well greased!  As friction increases, the amount of battery power you use will increase in consequence.
Also, make sure all contacts remain solid.  Though it's not a big issue with newer drones, rust in the contacts / loose contacts will eat power.

"DShot is a protocol that flight controllers use for communicating with ESCs. It stands for 'Digital Shot'. It is a new digital communication protocol developed by Flyduino in collaboration with Betaflight as an alternative to Oneshot and Multishot.

Oneshot and Multishot (and standard PWM) all use analogue signals. The length of an electrical pulse determines the value being sent from the flight controller to the ESC. This can lead to problems with accuracy if there are slight differences between the speeds of the clock signals in the ESC and the flight controller (which is why ESC calibration is required with analogue protocols). Also, these signals have a fixed length range of 1 to 2 milliseconds, which means they can't be sent more often than once every 4 ms or so, or 250 times a second.

Digital signals can also be more resilient in the presence of electrical noise.



The number associated with the protocol indicates how much data is sent per second.  There are several speed options available:


DShot150 – 150,000 bits/Sec
DShot300 – 300,000 bits/Sec
DShot600 – 600,000 bits/Sec
DShot1200 – 1,200,000 bits/Sec

"Just about anything will block/interfere with radio signaling if there's enough of it in the path between the transmitter and receiver or in the immediate vicinity of them. (sometimes referrred to as the Fresnel Zone) However, these are some of the most notorious offenders:


Tight spaces with a lot of multipath interference
Concrete and brick structures
Bodies of water
Soil and earth
Large structures
Forests and large amounts of trees
Lots of human bodies
etc.


One could go on forever listing out different materials, but these are some of the more common items to encounter for FPV.

In general, the rule is to maintain as much line-of-sight as possible between the transmitter and receiver. This is true because obstacles will force the radio waves to take indirect paths, bouncing repeatedly off of stuff until it hits the receiver antenna. Multipath interference comes from this, because often many different (multi)paths will converge on the receiver at different times and cause interference with each other, distorting the image that your goggles/FPV receiver will pick up.

"TL;DR: From purely a range consideration the 90 degree mounting is the best because of the orientations your quad might see. You'll want to get the antennas as far away from the frame as you can so that the frame can never block at least on antenna from seeing your transmitter.

When you are considering ways to mount your antennas on a miniquad however there isn't one best way to mount them. Range, quad orientation and durability all play a part in what will work best for you. That said there are two things you should know to understand about antenna placement and why the 90 setup is recommended for range.


The reason for two antennas.


The XM+ antennas both have the same function. The receiver simply compares their signal strength and picks which one is best. This lets you place them in different orientations so that depending on your orientation on antenna or the other will have adequate signal.


The radiation pattern.


Generally the monopole antenna has it's best signal reception at a direction that's perpendicular to the antenna itself. Conversely it suffers from pretty bad reception in the top and bottom directions. This image shows the typical radiation pattern. Imagine the wire antenna standing straight up inside this donut. The red directions have good reception and the green are where it is bad.



Now, since you have two antennas you can see how rotating the second one by 90 degrees would cover the deadspots of the first antenna.



These two orientations make for good coverage in almost any orientation. However, it's not perfect, those donuts are pretty flat. Mounting both antennas in a more upright 'V' orientation could provide a lot more even coverage, but only if you don't plan on doing something like diving straight down.

With all that said, realize that those nice donut patterns can be blocked by your frame if they are placed in such a way that the frame can come inbetween you and the antenna. You can see how this would happen in Paul's example. Not to say that's a bad way to do it. I do it that way often. For typical park rages it still gives you that 90 degree orientation and will protect your antennas from prop strikes and crashes more effectively. For extended ranges though, one antenna sticking out the top and one out the back will give you the best range.
",How to mount XM+ receiver antennas?,"I like to use XM+ receivers on many drones as they seem to work well and are small/light. What is the best angle and position to mount the antennas of an XM+ receiver in order to get the best signal?

"Altering the location of the CG (center of gravity) also changes the CM(center of mass) because the force of gravity acts roughly on the CM. Normally, the motor arms are equally sized so that all motors have equal control authority and all contribute equally to providing thrust while in level flight when the CM is close to the center of the multirotor. Another way to say this is that multirotor frames are constructed so that the CG, CM, and CL (center of lift/thrust) are all as close as possible to one another.

However, this is no longer the case because now each of the motors now has a slightly different lever arm distance to the CM of the multirotor. Consequently, not all of the motors have the same control authority and some of the motors will have to remain at higher/lower throttle than others while in level flight.
This will manifest itself in diminished flight performance. If all motors are running at the same throttle, the multirotor will naturally begin rotating with the longer lever arm(s) going upward and the shorter one(s) going down. If the distance between the CG/CM and CL isn't too great so as to not make the multirotor immediately flip over after raising the throttle, the I term in the PID controller of your flight controller should be able to account for the discrepancy after takeoff. The ability to pitch/roll in different directions will be different due to the asymmetric thrust distribution around the CG/CM.
Even so, it isn't ever recommended to fly with a significant distance between the CG/CM and CL. All (half-decent) frames are designed to minimize the risk that component placement will move the three far from one another, but this is an important consideration for scratch-built frames.
In the example from the OP, a case where the CG/CM was moved from the center to a location right behind the front two motors, the effects would be quite severe indeed. It's difficult for me to come up with a practical setup to create such a situation, but this is a good example of a worst-case situation, with the CG/CM to CL distance being close to 2/3 the arm length. (depending on the angle between the arms on the frame)

"Yes, on both counts! That is an S-video (aka. Mini-DIN-4) connector, and you can use it to make a buddy box cable. The port carries a 4-channel CPPM signal that can be used by cheap USB adapters as a joystick HID input to your computer or for buddy box mode, which FlySky calls &quot;Trainer mode&quot;. I've made one for my own use, following the specifications laid out by the user gcartled on the RCGroups forum.
Making the Cable
It appears that there are sellers with listings for ready-made FlySky trainer cables, like this one on eBay, but I haven't tested them to confirm that they work. Note that @JohnRix in the comments has mentioned that the adapter he purchased for the i6 was incompatible with the i6x.
After obtaining a spare S-video cable (or creating your own from Mini-DIN-4 male terminations), chop it somewhere in the middle and reorder the connections for the 4 internal wires such that the pins 1 and 2 are connected to the opposite number on the other end of the cable. i.e.:

pin 1 → pin 2
pin 2 → pin 1
pin 3 → pin 3
pin 4 → pin 4
metal housing → metal housing


(cit.)
This creates a crossover cable that allows the CPPM signals from the &quot;slave&quot;/trainee transmitter to be received by the &quot;master&quot;/trainer transmitter.
Configuring the Trainer Transmitter to Enable &quot;Trainer Mode&quot;
In order to use trainer/trainee functionality, the appropriate settings must be configured on the trainer's transmitter so that it knows what switch will be used to toggle on/off control inputs from the trainee's transmitter. In this setup, the trainer's radio is the only one bound to the aircraft.
These instructions are confirmed functional for the FS-i6X transmitter, but it is likely to also work with the FS-i6 and other derivatives:

Turn on the transmitter.
Hold the OK key to open up the menu.
Scroll to System Setup and select with the OK key.
Scroll down to Trainer mode and select with the OK key.
Scroll using the OK key so that the horizontal arrow points to Mode and then use the UP key to change from Off to On.

If you want to disable buddy box functionality in the future, come back here and change the Mode back to Off.


Scroll using the OK key so that the horizontal arrow points to Switch and then use the UP and DOWN keys to select the switch that you'd like to use to enable/disable buddy box functionality.

(WARNING: you shouldn't have this switch bound to anything on your aircraft, as this could cause issues inflight when something is accidentally triggered in the process of enabling/disabling the biddy box)
Note the position of the switch you selected that changes the text Inactive to Active at the bottom of the screen. The Active position enables the buddy box and vice versa.


Hold the CANCEL key until you hear a beep to save the changes and then press CANCEL twice more to escape the menus all together.

Now, go and fly!

"The distance is dependent on the wavelength of the lowest frequency. You can calculate the wavelength $\lambda$ (m) from $\lambda = c \div f$, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum (ms-1) and $f$ is the frequency (Hz.) Taking the centre frequencies of the ISM bands we get:
2.4 GHz: $$\frac{299 792 458 }{ 2 450 000 000 } ≈ 0.12 = 12 cm$$
5.8 GHz: $$\frac{299 792 458 }{ 5 800 000 000 } ≈ 0.05 = 5 cm$$
(Quick 'sanity check' tip: 5.8 GHz is about twice 2.4 GHz, so we expect the wavelength to be about half; looks good.)
The smallest separation is usually recommended as a quarter of the longest wavelength, which for 2.4 GHz is only 3cm - quite manageable. That said, greater separation helps so put them as far apart as your frame practically allows.

I can't determine if this one is compatible with the gear I already own.

Because I already own the transmitter and the FPV goggles. And from what I understood the gear I got is decent enough, so I'd rather keep using.
plus I'm used to flying a sim with the Taranis so I'd rather keep it.
The Context, ignore if you don't care why I'm looking for such a plug &amp; play solution:
Last year, after watching a few guys flying their quads, I decided to buy one. Having quite some experience with building computers and being pushed by the other guys to custom build it, I ordered a bunch of component (chosen by them) and bought some second hand from said friends. I got started building the drone and it was a mess. I had done soldering work a few years before but never had it required such precision so I messed up and burnt parts of my first FC. Replaced it, managed to solder everything, only to realize halfway through the build that I couldn't for the life of me pair the Taranis to the receiver and have no way to check if the Taranis is at fault for cheap. I did a lot of research, re-soldered using different connections, changed the settings in betaflight ... in the end I changed the receiver. Still the same problem, spent an other half dozen hours on it.
I spare you a whole lot more problems and research online...
conclusion: after a good 25 hours spent trying to get this drone working I got so frustrated that I put everything in a box and left it there.
note: during the year this group dissolved itself and I now have no contact with anyone that knows anything about quads, so I couldn't get help in building/troubleshooting anything.
Now, I want to fly, but I'd rather not have to build, flash &amp; setup everything myself while going blind and with nobody to help me if need be. Thus, I'm looking for a ready-to-fly drone.

"I think what you are looking for is a servo. At least, that's what it's called in the hobby, officially it's a servomotor. Each unit consists of a motor, gears, a sensor to measure the position of the output shaft, and a comparator circuit. The electronics compares the requested angle to the actual angle, and drives the motor as required to minimise the difference.

They're commonly used to control the steering for RC cars and boats, or the control surfaces in RC planes. They are specified by their movement speed and torque. Better servos have ball bearings on output shaft, and you can get metal gears for tough applications.
You might want to look at the servos used for retractable landing gear on RC planes. These servos only have two positions, and are generally geared a bit lower for extra torque.
Servos generally run at 4-6v and are controlled by a pulse width modulated signal from an RC receiver. Alternately you can buy a 'servo tester' for about $5 to generate this signal, or it's easy to generate from an Arduino.

"This question is difficult to answer without a few specifics.

By ‘how long does a LiPo last’, if you mean when it’s on a quad, then usually around five minutes on a five inch quad.

If you mean how long before it degrades, then that depends on a lot of things:

How low do you run your batteries during flight? Lowering them to below around 3.3V can damage them and reduce the lifespan.

How quickly do you get your batteries to a storage charge? Leaving LiPos at anything other than 3.7-3.8V for extended periods can lead to damaging them.

Do you balance charge them? Some chargers have the option to either charge or balance charge LiPos, so it’s good to check.

Do you charge up your LiPos to 4.2V? Some racers charge regular LiPo batteries (not LiHV as far as I’m aware) to 4.35V, which gives higher short term performance but degraded the battery.

Over all, there are many aspects towards the lifespan of a LiPo, and in general if you treat them right, they will last longer.

Some signs that you may want to retire a battery are visible puffing, if you feel there is a reduction in performance, and if the internal resistance of the cells rises significantly from when they were new.

"What is headless mode?
Headless mode is a specialized flying mode that is common in store-bought drones. It eliminates the need for focusing on the drone’s orientation and enables a much easier Line of Sight flying experience. This can make drone flying easier especially for beginners still learning how to control the flight path of the drone.
Whilst it may be useful for beginners to learn flying using this mode, it wouldn’t be too recommended. You can then get used to this mode and then have trouble unlearning it and learning how to fly the drone properly.
The only thing is that when you launch the drone, the front of the drone must be facing away from you to launch properly.
How does it work and how is it different to normal mode?
When you take off with the drone pointing forward, algorithms within the drone’s microcontroller will ensure that any directional changes are compensated. The drone will take instructions based on your current orientation as opposed to normal mode where the drone moves in regards to the drone's orientation, no matter where you are regarding the drone.
For example, if you are in normal mode and the drone is facing toward you, and you press left, the drone will go right (as left in the way it’s facing means right in the way you are facing) whereas, if you are in headless mode, the drone will move left in the direction you are facing the drone.
This diagram illustrates how normal mode is different from headless mode:

How do I enable it?
This will vary from drone-to-drone so one specific answer cannot be given. If your drone has it built-in (which most do), there should be something in the instruction manual saying how to enable it. Most likely it’s a button that needs to be pressed on your controller.

"In this situation, I would approach the other flyer(s) to say hello and discuss this with them to prevent misunderstandings or differences of opinion - for example, if the other flyer is new they might want much larger separation than you think is enough, whereas if you are both experienced you might be happy flying in close quarters.

Also, it might make life easier if you stand close to each other; I've done this before (albeit with people I knew) and it is useful to regularly share information like ""I'm at 200 ft by the tree on the left"", ""Thanks, I'm at 50 ft moving across to the right"" - and of course warnings like ""Unleashed dog approaching!"" and ""Helicopter!""



If you are looking for official guidance, you could check CAP 393 Article 95:


  95.—(1) The SUA operator must not cause or permit a small unmanned surveillance aircraft to be  flown  in  any  of  the  circumstances  described  in  paragraph  (2),  and  the  remote  pilot  of  a  small  unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly it in any of those circumstances, except in accordance with a permission issued by the CAA.
  (2) The circumstances referred to in paragraph (1) are—
   (a) over or within 150 metres of any congested area;
   (b) over or within 150 metres of an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons;
   (c) within 50 metres of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the control of the SUA operator or the remote pilot of the aircraft; or
   (d) subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), within 50 metres of any person.
  (3) Subject to paragraph (4), during take-off or landing, a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not be flown within 30 metres of any person.
  (4) Paragraphs  (2)(d)  and  (3)  do not  apply  to  the  remote  pilot  of  the  small  unmanned surveillance aircraft or a  person under the control of the remote pilot of the aircraft.
  (5) In  this  article,  “a small  unmanned surveillance aircraft”  means  a  small  unmanned aircraft which is  equipped to undertake any form of surveillance or data acquisition. (b)


I am not aware of any specific rule for separation in relation to other drones, unless they were to be considered a vehicle for rule 95(2)(c) in the quote but elsewhere in CAP393 they use ""flying machine"" to refer to (any) aircraft.

However, as always, there is the 'catch-all' in Articles 94 and 241 should something go wrong:


  94.—(1) A person must not cause or permit any article or animal (whether or not attached to a parachute) to be dropped from a  small unmanned aircraft so as to endanger persons or property.
  (2) The  remote pilot of  a  small  unmanned aircraft  may  only  fly  the  aircraft  if  reasonably satisfied that the flight can safely be made.
  (3) The  remote  pilot of  a  small  unmanned aircraft  must  maintain  direct,  unaided visual contact with the aircraft sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft, persons, vehicles, vessels and structures for the purpose of avoiding collisions.

To sum up the answer to your question as simply as I understand it: older drones that are not able to broadcast their information will NOT be grounded, however they will be required to only fly within FRIAs (FAA Recognised Identification Areas).

Under the current proposal, after one year no new FRIAs may be registered, so as they disappear over time it may become more difficult to legally fly non-compliant aircraft.

I am not a legal expert - if anyone feels my understanding is incorrect then please do let me know.
",Would the FAA&#39;s proposed Remote ID really ground older drones?,"The FAA has proposed new rules regarding drones, particularly Remote ID

Remote ID would assist the FAA, law enforcement, and Federal security agencies when a UAS appears to be flying in an unsafe manner or where the drone is not allowed to fly.
The development of Remote ID builds on the framework established by the small UAS registration rule (PDF) and the LAANC capability to lay the foundation of an Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management System (UTM) that is scalable to the national airspace.

Criticism has been harsh

“Casual drone users would have to establish, maintain, and renew subscriptions just to fly occasionally in their backyards. School programs that use drones may decide the costs are just too high to continue. A gift of a drone on Christmas would saddle your recipient with endless monthly fees. And connecting all drones to the internet would create new cybersecurity vulnerabilities.”

And then there are the technical barriers to compliance. Schulman points out that “thousands of drones and radio-controlled aircraft currently on the market have no means for internet connection and would be grounded.”

"This question seems to be quite the debate in many places. However, the general consensus falls between 3.7 and 3.85v per cell. You can find a similar inquiry here: Storing at 3.7 or 3.85v and here: LiPo storage voltage

It seems that generally, the difference between storage charging to 3.7v, 3.8v, or 3.85v is negligible for most people. However, I would recommend 3.7-3.8v per cell. I store my LiPos at 3.8v per cell and all of my year-old LiPos perform almost like they are brand new.

The exact voltage you storage charge LiPos is important, but it is even more important that you just take good care of them and do storage charge them. It's better to storage charge LiPos to a close enough voltage than to not storage charge them at all.

Also try swapping the motor to a different arm. This will eliminate the ESC as the issue. If the problem follows the motor to the new arm, then the the issue is the motor, if it stays put then it's the ESC.

"TL;DR:
You probably need to get a new battery pack. Your current one is likely at the end of its life.

My guess is that your battery is just old and has reached the end of its useful lifetime. The fully-charged capacity, and by extension flight time, of all batteries decreases over time when charged and discharged repeatedly. This process is sped along by pulling large amounts of current from the battery like what is sometimes necessary for multirotor flight.
Your description of the slow charge rate after the battery reaches ~12V points to the battery being degraded. At 12V, a 3S battery pack is sitting at ~4.0V/cell. This means that the charger has likely entered the balance charging phase where it tries to equalize the voltage of all 3 cells in the pack and slowly bring them up to 4.2V/cell.
Well-worn batteries will take longer in the balance charging phase because the internal resistances of each cell in the pack (which generally increases during the battery's lifetime at different rates for each cell in the pack) are different, resulting in more energy and time that must be used to fully balance the pack.
Tips for Increasing the Lifetime of a LiPo Battery
Although you mentioned that you're not really on a tight budget, you're probably interested in how you can make your next battery packs last longer. Here are some of the more common things that cause wear:

Sustained and peak current draw:
It's generally an excellent idea to avoid drawing excessive amounts of current from a battery. Full throttle punches are fun and sound amazing, but do contribute to accelerating the degradation of the battery, so maybe don't do them as often. :)

Charging beyond 4.2V/cell:
LiPo batteries shouldn't be charged beyond their full capacity of 4.20V/cell. Aside from increasing the risk of spontaneous combustion, the increased cell voltage puts extra strain on the internals of the battery, which accelerates battery degradation. It's true that some specific variants of LiPo have higher full-capacity voltages, like LiHv with ~4.25V/cell, but the vast majority of LiPo cells shouldn't be charged beyond 4.20V/cell.

Not storing packs at ~1/2 capacity (~3.7-2.8V/cell) for extended periods of time:
Much like how over-charging LiPo batteries beyond their full charge level increases the internal strain on the pack, the same is true to a lesser extent for lower cell voltages over a long period of time. It's generally accepted that storing LiPo batteries at ~1/2 capacity, which translates to ~3.7-3.8V/cell, is safe and is a happy medium for minimizing battery degradation over a long period. If you plan on not flying your batteries for more than a few days, it's a good idea to run what's often called a &quot;storage charge program&quot; on your balance charger to charge/discharge your battery to ~3.7-3.8V/cell. Then recharge your batteries back to full as soon as is practical before flying.

Draining a pack too far:
For normal use, permanent damage is caused to the battery if any of the cells drop below 3.0V/cell. Although as I mentioned previously, multirotors demand a lot from our batteries, so it's important that we try to keep the average cell voltage above ~3.4-3.6V during flight. This is because LiPo battery cell voltages drop off quite quickly below ~3.6V/cell, and so it's important to keep some margin to prevent any of the cell voltages from momentarily dipping below 3.0V before we can get the chance to land safely.

"I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I just had the same problem as you and your solution didn't work unfortunately. What I instead had to do was connect a +5V wire from the regulator to the FC, along with the ground wire that you connected.
I wasn't really satisfied with only solving the problem; I wanted to know how the OSD could flicker without affecting the rest of the video at all, and I think I have figured something out.
In both our cases the underlying problem was that the ESC (where the FC and thus OSD chip got it's power from) introduced noise in the output from the built in 5V regulator, which in turn causes a ground loop (At least in your case. In my case it might just have been a deficient regulator). When arming and applying throttle, the motors draws more current which in turns generates stronger magnetic fields that messes with the other electrical signals. This explains why some people (including me) can experience even more flickering when the motors spin faster.
But why is only the OSD affected by this problem, and not the rest of the video?

I haven't found any sources about this, so the following is just my hypothesis based on the information I could find, and what I already knew.
If we take a PAL signal for example, and black and white to make it easier (NTSC and PAL are the two types of systems used for analog FPV video, both quite similar), it uses the voltage level to determine the luminance level of each pixel in each scan line, where 1 V is completely white, and 0.3 V is black[1]. 0 Volts is used as a so called sync pulse, and between each new scan line there is a sync pulse.

[2]
My suspicion is that because the OSD chip in the FC effectively receives a different signal than the camera sent (because of a difference in potential between the two grounds*), it can miss sync pulses, and the OSD will appear as slight noise in the final image instead. Another theory is of mine is that the OSD chip will just give up when it doesn't receive what it expects.
When the signal finally comes to the VTX the ground potential is the same as the cameras, and the signal will be correct again (possibly with some unnoticeable noise).
*For example: imagine that the camera sends out a signal of 0.6 V. If the potential of the OSD chips ground is 0.1 V lower than that of the camera, it will interpret the signal as being 0.6 - (-0.1) = 0.7 volts.

I want to make it clear that this is just my (relatively) qualified guess, and you would probably have to measure the signals and know how the OSD chip works to know exactly what is going on. I would love to test this some more but unfortunately I don't own an oscilloscope, and a multimeter isn't really up to the task. Also, i would love to be proven wrong.

"There isn't an easy solution, because this isn't a common thing to do.
The main issue is that real-time control for FPV requires very little lag. Wifi requires several layers of processing, on a computer where it has to compete with other processes for processor time. Your video needs to be encoded and compressed, and still work if some data is missing. Most digital video isn't real-time, and relies on a buffer to smooth out these delays - but you can't fly with images that are a few seconds old.
That said, it's pretty simple to stream video over wifi with a small computer like a Raspberry Pi, and there are lots of guides on how to do it. Similarly there are lots of ways to send other data over wifi - it's just networking, and there are lots of guides on how to use UDP or TCP/IP.
You probably can't use the same computer to actually fly the drone. Again it's a real-time system that needs to adjust the motors hundreds or thousands of times each second. I think you would be best to use a normal flight controller running iNav, and to send it control signals from the Pi, via S-Bus. Effectively the flight controller attempts to hover at a GPS position, and you send it a new position occasionally.
I've not actually done this myself, or even read about anyone doing it, but I suspect it has been done.

"Longer blades are more efficient, but it's only practical to a point. Blades have to withstand high RPM, be balanced, and be light. Also the linear velocity of the tip of the blade increases a ton if u have a long prop. At the same RPM, every rotation the tip travels 2pi*r meters, so more r means more distance in the same time.
This may not seem like an issue, however propellers really don't work very efficiently close to or above the speed of sound. Having the tips go supersonic can lead to compression and other issues.

"JR was one of the earliest manufacturers (if not first) to introduce the concept of modules on their radios.  In the old days of AM/FM radios, the transmitter is built to transmit on a particular frequency band (e.g. 2.4GHz, or more likely 36MHz in those days).  Then you could add the capability to work with a different frequency band by clipping a module into the back of your transmitter.  As long as your transmitter (or module) and receiver were both AM or FM they'd talk quite happily.

When 2.4GHz came along the market became more fragmented, and every manufacturer came out with their own protocols, so you not only had to transmit 2.4GHz, but also speak the right protocol.  This is why different brands of transmitter and receiver (e.g. Frsky/Taranis and Spektrum) can't be mixed interchangeably.  Modules can solve that problem by giving your transmitter the capability to talk different protocols even though they might all be 2.4GHz (e.g. the Jumper Multiprotocol module).

These days the two most common use for modules is either support for new protocols (e.g. the multi protocol module on the Jumper radios, or a DSM module on Frsky).  Or different bands, e.g. CrossFire which operates it's own protocol on the 900MHz band (for longer range).

The Frsky Taranis is probably the most popular radio today amongst quad pilots.  When Frsky first made their radio they either bought the molds or licensed the design (can't remember which, but it was a legit ""money changed hands"" transaction, not a rip off clone job) for their case from JR. Once you know this, it's not at all surprising that a Frsky Taranis and a specific model of JR (I'm not sure which) are virtually indistinguishable when you put the side by side. 

Since Frsky radios were made in the same moulds, it would be extremely unlikely for the Frsky module bay and JR bays not to be exactly the same size.  You'll sometimes also hear them called ""JR modules"", or ""JR module bay"" for this reason.  Whether the Frsky and JR modules are electrically compatible I don't know.  i.e. a genuine JR module would fit in a Frsky bay, but I don't know if they'd work and not be damaged.  I assume they would be electrically compatible, but I don't know of anyone who's tried it.

Other modern radios (e.g. the Jumper T16) have copied the design of the module bay so that popular modules (such as TBS CrossFire) also work on those radios.  TBS don't sell different Crossfire modules for FrSky and Jumper radios, so these must be compatible with each other.

I'm not aware of any modules that aren't transceivers (either different bands, or different protocols).  Hosting additional transceivers was the intended use of the module bay, I can't think of anything else I might want to install in the back of my transmitter that isn't a transceiver.  Depending on what the pins do, and the voltage and current a module can draw from the radio, in theory there's no reason another device could draw power from the radio via the module pay.
",What is the background of remote controller modules?,"I've seen that in many remote controllers you can plug in an external module under it.


Are there other purposes for these modules than just being transceivers?
Are the module bays offered by multiple brands, or is it just a single brand thing?
Are there different styles of modules that look similar but don't work interchangeably?

"Disclaimer: I don't know anything of the following for sure, so be careful. Be very, very careful.

The PID controller itself does not care whether it's a 5 or 10-inch quad. The PID gains, though, do care, and the Betaflight default preset numbers are for something around 5"" size. For instance, for a tiny whoop-size quad the gains must typically be raised 3x or more!

I'd imagine this means that for a larger quad the gains should be several times lower than the default, although I have no way of confirming this. In any case, having low PID gains doesn't promote dangerous behavior from the quad, so it's safe to start by cutting the default gains in half or even 3x and working from there. I'd also predict that a bigger quad, having more inertia in both the motors and the frame itself, will need larger feedforward gains to feel responsive than a typical 5"".

Another option would be to try and google some published PIDs for a similar-size quad, although that might be a dangerous proposition if you just copy them. 

In any case, start from a safe number (it's a 10 inch, so be safe. be very safe) and slowly work your way up. Analyzing the step response in BlackBox logs to gauge the direction in which you need to tune is probably a good idea as well. 

The other place you should look at is the filtering tab, as a larger quad naturally has lower characteristic frequencies. It's great that you run RPM filtering, but take a look at the regular lowpass filters as well, you might want to lower the cutoffs for them. You may want to look at your BlackBox logs here as well to decide.

Other than the radically-different gain numbers and possibly playing with the filters, though, the configuration shouldn't be all that different. Good luck, and stay safe.
",How to PID tune a 10&quot; drone?,"I have a 10"" inch drone that I have trouble tuning. On the default Betaflight PIDs it feels really unstable, and I have tried to raise P, I and D both together and one by one without noticing much difference. Some things I almost doubled even.

I should probably also add that I run Betaflight 4.1 with bidirectional dshot and RPM filtering.

"Performance is unlikely to be improved, in terms of speed or agility, or even load-bearing capacity, as they are heavier, slightly less efficient aerodynamically, and more expensive.

What you do get is a degree of fault-tolerance. 

With a quadcopter, losing one rotor means your drone will fall out of the sky. With an octocopter (or hexacopter, but an octocopter can lose more motors and still be able to fly) losing one rotor is not fatal - it will still fly, however, it will have a reduced control authority.

This makes them very desirable for carrying expensive loads - such as a £50,000 camera - you really don't want to drop that out of the sky if you have a fault.

"The simple answer is ""more width equals more torque"". 

More torque let's you drive a higher pitch or larger diameter prop effectively. Given the same size prop, it will drive it with more effectiveness. Added torque allows the prop to spin up or slow down faster, which ultimate results in a better flying quad because it can more quickly and accurately respond to your stick inputs.

In the miniquad community, this is the reason a lot of freestyle pilots trend toward wider motors on a 5"" prop compared to racers. It provides a higher level of smoothness because of how it reacts.

Another effect of more width is more efficiency especially with big crafts that are targeting flight time. You'll see lots of the big (15"" or larger) propeller quadcopters with very wide motors. For instance a 5010 stator size. High performance isn't usually the goal here so a wider stator allows them to drive the big prop without lots of excess weight and power that they don't need.

Oscar Liang also has a good concise explanation of different motor stator sizes here

This is an endurance quad I built years ago with the 5010 motors I mentioned. Just to give you an idea of the scale and the uses of a very wide motor.

"There’s a lot to unpack here, so I’m going to give a general kind of advice that should be helpful for anyone trying to get cleaner video:
Electrical Power
There are two main aspect to the image transmission: the camera and the VTX.
Whenever you have noise, the first step would be to increase power filtering as much as possible.
The easiest way to do this is to add a capacitor to the battery pads to filter out the voltage spikes.
If that doesn’t work, try powering your VTX from a BEC on your flight controller instead of VBAT (if that’s what you already have).
Also try powering your camera from a BEC on your VTX if it has one.
Then try adding a common ground between the camera and the VTX to avoid what is called a ground loop.
There are other sources of power noise, which could include oscillations that cause voltage spikes in the motors.
Antennas
The antenna you use also has a big impact on video.
The best way to ensure good video link quality is to have two circularly polarised antennas with the same polarisation, for example RHCP with RHCP and LHCP with LHCP.
You can also use a patch antenna to increase the reception of your goggles at the expense of the number of directions from which you can receive a signal.
VTX
Have you ever powered on your VTX without an antenna? This can sometimes cause the VTX to become damaged.
If you have a spare VTX, try using that and see if quality improves.
VTX Settings
If you’re flying in a wide area, you can try increasing your VTX power (as long as it is legal).
If you’re flying in a tight space like a bando, sometimes having a higher power output can actually make the video signal worse due to multipath interference. If you experience that, you may want to try lowering the power output.
Frequency
Make sure your goggles are on exactly the same frequency as your video transmitter.
People often use the auto-scan function on their goggles, however this is known to be inaccurate and often goes to a close channel, but not the exact one.
The wrong frequency will introduce static, but it is unlikely to create the lines you describe.
It is also possible that lines may be caused by RF interference from WiFi, power lines etc. You may be able to get around this by changing your frequency.
",Quality of transmitted image and electrical problems,"There is a question already regarding a flickering OSD, but I wonder how other image quality problems relate to electrical problems. What's the first thing one has to look for when the transmitted image is jumping or features vertical running lines or the quality of the image seemingly depends on throttle value? What are common wiring strategies to avoid these kinds of problems and what are their respective root cause?

What I usually do is power the VTX from BEC/ESC (or directly from battery if it is rated for it) and power the camera from the VTX 5V out and braid the wires, but I think there must be more to know about image transmission issues.

"Yes, voltage sag is perfectly normal and safe for the battery, so long as it remains above the recommended minimum voltage levels.

The C rating is important as the construction of a cell affects how quickly it can provide current. The internal surface area of the positive and negative terminals is related to the current it can provide - a larger surface area lowers the internal resistance and this causes less heating when discharging. This is why higher C packs are bulkier.
",Is voltage sag safe if the voltage isn&#39;t too low?,"I know that a liPo cell should never be below 3.0 volts, but can voltage sag during high throttle maneuvers damage the battery excessively even if the voltage it not below that level?

And if that is the case; should you try to limit how much the voltage sags by getting a battery with a higher C-rating, or will the difference be negligible if you go from, for example, 75 C to 100 C on a 1500 mAh battery.

"Your description of the dramatic voltage drop (from 5V to 0.5V) upon the connection between the flight controller (FC) and 4-in-1 ESC makes me think that the issue you're seeing is most likely due to a short or low resistance path to ground. There are other possible failure modes that could cause this, but a ground fault sounds most probable here.
Why?
When a ground fault is created in one of the components attached to the 5V power rail generated by the ESC's BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit), a substantial current greater than the BEC's rating for continuous power delivery flows. This is due to Ohm's law, $I = \frac{V}{R}$ which states that a large current (I) will flow if the circuit resistance (R) is tiny.
The usual mode of operation for power supplies when they experience surges in power demand is to drop their output voltage in an attempt to prevent catastrophic failures of themselves or downstream components by decreasing the power output. (Power $P = \frac{V}{I}$) This is a near-ubiquitous safety feature.
Confirming a Diagnosis of a Ground Fault
Since ground faults manifest themselves as low-resistance paths between the power rails, the way to test for the existence of one is to (use a multimeter) measure the resistance between the +5V and GND lines on the FC and the 4-in-1 ESC independently.
It would be best if you could fully disconnect all peripherals from the FC before measuring for a ground fault, as it is possible that the issue is with one of them and not the FC, but this can also be done once a problem with the ESC is eliminated to possibly avoid desoldering and resoldering the components back together.
NOTE: remember to take resistance measurements with no power attached to the device being measured!
If the measured resistance for the FC isn't high (the exact threshold differs between circuits, but the difference between a ground fault and a safe circuit is significant and should be noticeable), then there is a ground fault somewhere inside the FC. Likewise, if the measured resistance for the ESC isn't high, then there is a ground fault somewhere inside the FC. If both components have low resistance paths between the power rails, then they both have ground faults.
Resolution
You could either attempt to correct the ground fault in the affected component(s) or replace them. Sometimes the cause of the ground fault is some SMD (Surface Mount Device) component that is too small for you to comfortably work on or broken solder mask in the PCB, in which case fixing it may be more trouble than it's worth.
However, the only cost of trying to fix and not buy new is your time. And hey, you never know when a troubleshooting venture like this will teach you something new about electronics!
",4 in 1 ESC and FC won&#39;t turn on when connected together,"After crashing my drone recently, my ESC and flight controller won't turn on (the power led lights up on the FC, but nothing else works either it doesn't anymore, or I was wrong before) any more when they are connected together. When I disconnect the ribbon cable between the FC and the ESC, the ESC turns on as it should (Beeps when the battery is connected), and the FC turns on when I connect it to USB, and it seems to function correctly.

I have measured the connections going between the two, and all of them appears to be okay, except that 5 V from the ESC drops to about 0.5 V when the flight controller is connected. If I connect both the ribbon cable and a USB cable, the FC turns on and the video feed goes from showing black (no OSD) to show the actual video. The ESC still won't turn on though.

I noticed that the capacitor had come loose from one terminal, but it seems unlikely that that caused these problems. Unless it caused voltage spikes that damaged something?

Regarding your wire thickness, as you say it all depends on the expected current.

I have never heard of a standardized wifi drone control protocol.

"These components can be split into two functional groups, one for transmitting a picture and one for receiving it, which aren't connected to one another by wires. The Runcam camera and Eachine VTX are both parts of the transmitting section, while the receiver doesn't need to be soldered to anything else in the receiving part.
Required Soldered Connections:
You'll need to make the following wire connections between the different components: (splicing together the components' connector pigtails is recommended as opposed to trying to solder directly to the camera)

Battery+ → VTX 7-24V wire
Battery- → VTX GND wire (there are a total of two available, choose either one)
Battery+ or VTX +5V wire → Runcam 5-36V wire
Battery- or VTX GND wire → Runcam GND wire (in 5-pin camera connector, not the 2-pin camera controller connector)
Runcam Video wire → VTX VIDEO wire

Essentially, both the camera and VTX need to be connected to each other for the analog video signal (one wire) and each need to have connections to ground/GND and a positive voltage source within their requirements.
Battery Setup:
In this setup, the VTX is actually the component that constrains the kind of power sources/batteries you can use. It requires 7-24V to operate, which means you can use 2S-5S LiPo batteries with it. (or another battery pack within the same voltage range)
Most drone/RC LiPo batteries these days come with either an XT30 or XT60 connector, but can be purchased with other terminations. See this page for a list of the most common ones. Once you know what your battery's connector is called, you can purchase a set of connectors online and solder them to the VTX and camera as required.
It's unlikely you'll be able to match the connectors that come with the parts together. While the connectors are all off-the-shelf parts, their usage is unfortunately not really that standardized between manufacturers. You're probably better off just cutting the cable that came with the camera in half and soldering it together with the pigtail wires that come with the VTX.
Once this is done, you can hopefully power on the VTX, camera, and receiver without issues, (remember to screw on the VTX's antenna before powering up so you don't damage it!!!) set the VTX and receiver to the same channel, and view the picture on the connected Android phone/tablet.

But this causes issues because I can tip the rotor in different directions with my hand, and so it seems like it would wobble when turning, and the fit is definitely not secure.

This second result was achieved after inserting two washers between the nut and rotor, tightening down the nut, untightening and removing the washers, and the tightening the nut once more.

I removed the washers because while I had read that some people tighten their rotors with washers, the gap seemed too large for this to be the solution, so I assumed I was doing something incorrectly in the mounting. Where did I go wrong, and how should these rotors be mounted?

"Adding more motors will generally give you more power, meaning you can lift more. You will however need a bigger battery to get the same hover time, since more motors will use more power as well. So there is a trade off between being able to lift a lot, and flying for a longer time.
Another advantage of more motors is that you can maintain maneuverability even if you lose a motor. So if you are carrying some expensive equipment or doing something critical, six or even eight motors might be preferable.
I'm not aware of any simulators that can test this accurately, but you can use this online calculator to test different configurations. I assume that is close to what you want? Most of the options require a payment, but you can probably get an idea of what you want without that.

"As you point out, the Teensy 4.0 online documentation mentions that neither the digital GPIO nor analog I/O are 5v-tolerant pins. It appears that the ESCs in the kit you linked to only have a PWM signal input and no bi-directional communication bus (e.g. Bidirectional DSHOT), so the only voltage present on the PWM input line would be one that you create. (thus there is no real danger of the ESC putting 5v on the signal line, though the 5v BEC pin will still have it)
However, you may run into another issue when trying to issue commands to the ESC from the Teensy. Being a 3v3 logic-level device, its logic high may not be sufficient voltage to &quot;trigger&quot; the ESC, depending on how the ESC's software interprets incoming signals. You can address this with a &quot;level converter&quot; (essentially just a set of small BJT transistors to switch 5v lines with 3v3 ones and vice versa) like this one from Amazon.

"Most omnidirectional antennae have two factors that work well for them.

1) They have fairly symmetrical and uniform RF profiles. This means that you are less prone to sudden drop-outs in the video as you change the orientation of the antenna as it is less likely that you will line up well with an area of lower RF intensity.

2) They are often circularly polarised, as the mushroom is. This means that that the correct Rx / TX combination effectively cuts out interference from signals reflected from various obstructions, making for a more clean and reliable reception.

"While I'm far from knowledgeable enough to give you a chart like you requested, I can do a general overview of the methods commonly used in RC modelling for airframe fabrication.

I must begin with this: Almost all of these are applicable to an aircraft of about any size. It's even hard to tell which is better, they're all just different. So, without further ado, the list:


Extruded polymer foam. This is what most commercially manufactured models are made of. The manufacturing process involves CNC-machined molds, special extruding machinery, and a lot of money spent upfront. However, the models can be of any shape imaginable, are quite durable, light (although not the lightest) have excellent aerodynamics, and the unit cost is cheap once you get going. The load-bearing parts are usually reinforced/stiffened with carbon fiber inserts, although wooden reinforcements are not uncommon. There are several types of foam that can be used, each with different characteristics.
Hotwired polymer foam. This is the DIY method of making foam planes, although some commercially-available planes use it as well. It involves a resistive wire which is heated by a current and is used to cut a block of foam into the desired shape using a bow or other device that keeps the wire under tension. As with extruded foam planes, load-bearing sections are usually reinforced with carbon fiber for stiffness. The same types of foam can be used as with extrusion. The available shapes are limited by what can be achieved with straight cuts, although complex shapes can be created by gluing simpler sections together. See this video for an overview of the process. Sometimes (most of the time?) only the wing airfoil is wire-cut, while the rest of the airplane is fabricated using other methods. Planes made using this method are often covered with heatshrink film to add stiffness and durability.
Folded flat materials. Airplanes can be made from a variety of sheeted materials by cutting, creasing and folding them into shapes which are then glued together. The materials include (but are not limited to) foamboard (foam between two layers of paper/thin cardboard), depron (flat sheets of foam), corrugated cardboard or even paper. The very simplest models can even be made without folding, just by cutting the required outline out of a flat sheet, while the advanced builds feature smooth curved surfaces. While usually not especially sleek-looking, airplanes made using this method fly surprisingly well and are very durable! Most of this comes from the fact that they are also extremely light for their size, though. In any case, a foamboard (or cardboard, or depron) plane is very easy to build or fix and requires minimal tools (knife, ruler, glue) to do so. This type of construction is extremely popular in the RC community due to the simplicity and cheap price. The most prominent proponent of folded models is Flite Test, who publish free plans for all of their models. There are also countless plans for folded planes on various RC forums.
Wood and film. This is the ""oldschool"" method. It is very similar to the methods used for construction of early full-scale aircraft, and involves building a wooden ""skeleton"" for the plane out of precisely-cut thin pieces of wood (usually balsa) and covering it with a special heat-shrink film to form the surface of the airfoil. This method takes a lot of time and work, and involves cutting and gluing together hundreds of wooden parts. The method creates light, strong and stiff airframes, which can nonetheless be brittle if hit the wrong way in a crash and time-consuming to fix. While less common nowadays, this construction method remains moderately popular, with a great variety of plans available online.
Glass and carbon fiber composites. While carbon tubes, strips and sheets are used extensively together with all of the construction methods discussed above to add mechanical strength and stiffness in critical points to a weaker or more flexible material, some airframes are constructed entirely out of composites. This is arguably the most high-tech and definitely the most high-performance (if done properly) construction method of the ones discussed here. It is also the most expensive one, per unit, though it doesn't come anywhere near extruded foam in terms of upfront setup costs and thus is within reach of hobbyists who want to make only a small number of copies of their design. Creating a glass or carbon fiber airframe requires making a mold of the desired shape, carefully laying up the fiber, soaking (or impregnating) it with resin and curing under pressure, usually with a vacuum pump, to make sure that the absolute minimum of that resin actually stays in the part. Then comes sanding, polishing, and assembly of the parts. Carbon fiber, when properly done, is extremely strong yet light, and is used in high-performance thermal gliders and other planes which must withstand extreme forces while being as light as possible. While strong, such planes are often hard to fix when they do get broken (at least without compromising their original strength or lightness). Glass fiber, though somewhat outdated, is also still a popular choice for larger planes, as it is significantly less expensive and easier to fix. Sometimes DIY molded glass fiber reinforcements can be found on planes constructed from other materials, and usually made by laying the fiber directly on top of the fuselage, eliminating the need for a mold.

"No matter how quickly you slow down the propellers after an impact with the ground, much of the damage actually comes from the impact directly into the ground and the force from the mass of the quad, so the speed of the props shouldn’t make too much of a difference.

If you mean the slowing down the props after it’s on the ground would save them, it may prevent further damage to the props, however the current draw if the props get caught in something could easily fry an ESC so it is likely more economical to sacrifice the props.

I generally go by the rule that if I crash, disarm as fast as possible. This stops me from burning ESCs as I’m usually disarmed before I hit the ground, though this comes with the negative that i can’t recover after a crash because I’ve disarmed.

"It sounds like the balance lead for the first cell isn't connected somewhere. The wire may have come off inside the charger, or it could be the balance plug, the wire, or an external parallel board (if you're using one).

I'd open up the charger and test the voltage at the back of the balance plug, and see if you can spot any broken solder joints.
",Empty Cells on LiPo - Balance Charger or Battery Problem?,"I recently opened up a box of 5 year old 3S LiPos which I had in storage. When I hooked them up to my Turnigy Accucel 6 80w balance charger, they mostly measured total voltages around 11v~. However, upon connecting the balance leads, the charger is saying that all of the old batteries have only 2 out of 3 cells carrying voltage (and one was at only 1 of 3). Similarly, when I try to balance charge these batteries, I get a ""cell error"". It's possible the batteries are bad, but it seems weird for them all to be bad in exactly the same way.

For example, on one of the 3S batteries, voltage reported is:

0.00 6.07 3.87
0.00 0.00 0.00


This shouldn't even be possible, there's no way I have 6.07V in one cell.

I proceeded to test the voltage of these batteries directly with a multimeter (followed this guide) and I'm seeing voltages on all three cells. What's a little odd is on the one I tested, they all seem to report the exact same voltage (3.72V). Testing the main power lead directly, I get 11.16V (3.72V x 3).

It seems reasonable to assume there's something wrong with the balance charger, but I wanted a second opinion. I was able to use the balance charger to successfully charge some new 4S batteries, but I don't have any new 3S batteries handy. Is it possible I just have a problem with the circuitry for the 3S balance connection?

"To fly above ground effect, you need thrust equal to the weight of the aircraft (or slightly more, as you want to climb).

Ground effect doesn't hold aircraft down, it just makes it easier to fly when they are close to the ground. The exact amount varies quite widely depending on exactly how close the wing/rotor is to the ground. For a plane or helicopter it may only be 10% extra lift, but a vehicle designed to maximise ground effect (like a hovercraft) can fly with vastly less power than would be required to fly without ground effect.

Ground effect is particularly noticeable if you hover a model helicopter inverted over a smooth surface. As it descends towards the floor, it looks as if it lands in a big soft cushion - decelerating and bobbing around at about half to a third of rotor diameter. You can hover without the constant adjustments in collective pitch that are normally required, and need to drastically reduce thrust to go lower. When you're half an inch or less off the floor, it's probably only using 10-20% of the pitch required for normal hovering, and there's a self-levelling effect so it's much easier than it looks!
For a typical FPV quadcopter with 5"" props on top of the motors, you almost can't feel ground effect if you put the battery under the frame. With the battery on top you can feel a noticeable cushion and you can find a throttle setting that holds the quad off the ground but won't climb out of ground effect. I'd estimate that it's flying at about 80-90% of normal power. 

While the power may be reduced, it can be harder to hold a multi-rotor or helicopter in place when in ground effect. The bubble of higher pressure tries to escape out from underneath the aircraft, pushing it in the opposite direction.  

A general rule of thumb is that the reduction in power due to ground effect starts to be noticeable when the altitude is less than around half or a third of the wing span or rotor diameter. The 'air bubble' effect on position holding while hovering is noticeable one or two diameters above the ground. Both tail off gradually so there's no hard limit.

"Depending on your budget I would look at these two options:
Diatone Taycan: this is a cinewhoop style quad that is more than powerful enough to fly outside as well. It will not be as nimble as your typical freestyle quad but if that is not what you are looking for you can't go wrong with this one.
HGLRC Sector 132: This option will be cheaper as the Taycan but seems to offer good value for the money. By default there are prop guards that allow you to fly indoors (not ducts) and if you remove them, you can start freestyling outdoors.
Just based on the type of build, the Taycan should be more sturdy and last longer than the Sector 132. That being said, this is a hobby where you can destroy any type of quad if you start pushing your limits and try out more challenging moves.

"ESCs for these tiny motors are always built into a single board that also contains the flight controller (and often the receiver and video transmitter). I'm afraid you won't find them individually.

If you notice that the bell of a motor feels loose or the motor is excessively noisy or has a grinding sound, it is likely worn-out bearings. You can either replace the bearings or buy a new motor. 

Another thing that happens is the magnets can demagnetize over time if the motors get hot. A way to know if this has happened is to run the motor with no load. If the RPMs are unusually high, the magnets are likely losing their strength. In this case, you need a new motor.

"As ifconfig pointed out, the most common way to continue using a not entirely functional 4-in-1 is to solder a standalone ESC to substitute for the damaged one(s). Balance is not that much of an issue (that's what the I term is for), unless you're doing the highest performance flying, in which case you should just replace the whole thing. 

Also, in order to not lose current sensing on the new ESC, it can pay to solder your new ESC's power leads directly to the VBAT power traces after the shunt resistor on the 4-in-1 (they are usually exposed and sometimes even have metal rails soldered to them). If you don't want to bother or aren't that good at soldering, you can usually make do without rewiring the extra ESC, and just adjust the current sensor multiplier. This isn't going to give you as precise a reading, but it's an okay approximation for gauging general current usage and deciding when to land, just don't rely on it too much. Multiply the number by 3/4 (or less, depending on how many surviving ESCs you have on the same board) for a first estimate, and maybe later make a finer adjustment by measuring the true mAh used from the pack vs. used mAh indicated in the OSD.

There are two more interesting ways to make use of a damaged 4-in-1, however. 

The first one is similar to what ifconfig is suggesting, but instead of adding a standalone ESC, you add another 4-in-1 to the same stack, and wire it to the same flight controller (but to different motor pins, of course). For this you can even use another damaged ESC, as not all of the individual ESCs on the board may be used. This also gets rid of the balance problem if it bothers you somehow, and also lets you avoid clipping the wires of one of your motors shorter in order to accomodate the individual ESC. 

The same caveat applies about current sensors as with an individual ESC, and it's going to be harder to wire the two power rails together, so you're probably stuck with using just one of the current sensors and adjusting the multiplier.

The second, and more advanced, is to just replace the damaged component on your ESC. It is usually one (or several) of the power transistors (FETs) of the ESC, and those can be easily replaced if you know how to use a heat gun. You'll need the replacements however. Most FETs used in popular 4-in-1s can be ordered, so it's a question of identifying the part number.

"The reason why this is recommended for racers is likely due to the fact that during these high-throttle punches, the voltage of the battery sags from the load and so more current is pulled from the battery to increase the motor RPM.

Power is equal to VI when V is voltage and I is current, which can be rewritten (by substitution of Ohm's law V = IR in for V) as I^2 * R. This means that if more current is drawn to compensate for a voltage sag, the power consumed by the motors increases by a greater amount because the resistance of the circuit is constant. (for all intents and purposes) For example, in the hypothetical scenareo that twice the current is drawn, four times the power would be consumed. This results in quicker battery drain.

The 10% figure that you've heard isn't a hard line, but rather just a suggestion based on experience with miniquad hardware and its capabilities. This recommendation isn't just specific to racing; all quads would benefit from the efficency (energy extraction from the battery) boost from rarely using the top XX% of the throttle range. However, this is often more important in racing scenareos where it is often necessary to make the most of the energy in the battery pack you're using because you've selected the smallest and lightest one possible and need as much energy as you can get to complete the course in record time.

"There are several steps to cleaning the motor:
Clean the chassis and speed control
An air compressor can be used to blow off the dust and dirt that has accumulated on the chassis and speed control. It’s best to work with a clean car and workspace to prevent crud from getting into the motor. If necessary, use an old toothbrush to remove stubborn dirt deposits.
Inspect the wiring

Check the speed control for frayed wires and damaged insulation; these can lead to radio interference and, worse, short-circuiting, which can burn up the motor and speed control. Repair damaged wires with heat-shrink tubing or liquid electrical tape.

Remove the motor

You do not need to unsolder the motor’s power leads or unplug the sensor harness, but doing so will give you more freedom to work. After removing the motor, wipe it with a rag to remove dust and dirt.

Disassemble the motor
Take the motor apart (this is quite easy to do) then you can wipe the individual parts of the motor.
Clean the bearings

Remove the rear bearing from the motor for cleaning. The front bearing on Novak brushless motors is glued to the front endbell and cannot be removed; leave the front bearing in place, and give it a good dousing with motor spray.

(Steps adapted from this link)
How to take the motor apart: (added per OP's request)

IMPORTANT: Before disassembling the motor, if your item carries a warranty, opening and attempting your own repair, will void whatever warranty you have.

First, get to know the parts of your brushless motor:

(Image Source)
The parts needed/recommended for disassembly:

(Image Source)
Step 1:

The first step involves in removing the circlip (E-ring), followed by the collar ring from the rear shaft using the pliers. Be cautious when removing the circlip because it might spring out. If you do not have any spares, do not lose it or bend it out of shape.


(Image Source)
Step 2:

The second step is to pull and remove the rotor (the bell) from the stator (the body).


(Image Source)
Step 3:

Notice that there are two bearings attached to the rear end and front end of the stator. The next step is to remove the bearings from the stator. Sometimes, the bearings are easy to remove, and some have a tight fit. Remove one of the bearings using barbeque skewer or any wooden stick to plug out the bearing from the stator. Usually, the front end bearing is easier to remove.


(Image Source)



(Image Source)
Step 4:

After you have managed to remove one of the bearings, use a pin punch tool to push the other bearing out from the stator.


(Image Source)
Step 5:

Place the stator on the plastic wire spool / solder bobbin and carefully tap the pin punch tool using the hammer until the bearing drops out from the stator.


(Image Source)



(Image Source)
Step 6:

The next procedure is to remove the shaft from the rotor (the bell). Use the allen key to remove the set screw on the rotor.

Step 7:

The final step is to push the shaft out from the rotor using the similar pin punch tool technique implemented previously to remove the bearings.

"As far as I can tell, after doing some digging, There are a few things to consider when boosting a Caddx Vista to 1200mw. First, the Caddx Vista tends to get hotter that the DJI air unit, so heat is one thing to consider. If the drone is flying, there should be enough airflow to dissipate the heat, so 1200mw shouldn't cause any overheating issues. Just make sure the drone isn't sitting somewhere with the Vista on a high-power setting. 

Another thing that seems to happen when using a higher power setting (whether that be 1200mw or just 1000mw) is that the bit rate drops. Several people claim that when flying with 1000/1200mw, the bit rate drops and causes lower image quality.

",What are the available solutions for creating complex user-defined UAV behavior in autopilots?,"Most freely available autopilot-enabled flight control hardware and firmware for hobby/consumer-grade UAVs seem to have a rather fixed feature set.

There are sometimes specialized modes such as thermal soaring and terrain following.

I may have missed this, though.

To be clear, I'm looking for a way to write logic outside of the main flight control/autopilot package, either via some kind of scripting engine native to the autopilot or as a program running on a device parallel to the autopilot that can communicate to it and get the necessary flight information/send commands.

"I think this problem had two different reasons; two screws that held the flight controller were a loose, and there was likely a problem with the connections between the gimbals and mail board on the transmitter.
The screws that were loose were both on the same side, which caused the FC to &quot;lag behind&quot; the movement of the quad and thus giving false values to the PID-controller. At least that is my theory.
The problem with the transmitter was not as obvious, but I whan looking at the reciever tab in Betaflight Configurator, I noticed that the roll channel acted almost as if it was smoothed.

To clarify a bit: It felt like I was using rates that were much lower than they actually were.

"Among open-source options, Emuflight, INav &amp; Ardupilot (different focus) Butterflight (mostly defunct), Raceflight (mostly defunct).  There is still Cleanflight and Baseflight, which are the shared lineage for Betaflight, Emu, Butr, and others.
Of these, EMU has an EKF (Enhanced Kalman Filter) variant of filtering, and also in older releases captures a lot of the 'goodness' of BF 3.5.7 filtering with a few PID adjustments that some pilots prefer for feel - and is now where Project Mockingbird does custom whoop tune development.

FlightOne, especially FalcoX adds a lot of ease of use for OSD configuration, and on most setups the stock tune out of the box or selected from a short list of defaults will fly really well.  Require FL1 FC or FL1 license on specific F411 targets (at the moment) - FL1 makes great ESCs if you can get ahold of them.

KISS is also a closed source, with mostly one source of ongoing development, but provides impressively good flight performance as well.  Needs KISS FC to work, I do recommend other ESCs.

For closed source options, the biggest downside is cost and need to re-learn some of the approaches if you're familiar with Betaflight already.

The biggest feature-set of Betaflight lies in the RPM Filtering capability (which in my experience can make cheap builds outperform most people's expensive stuff), although for many users without a background that makes the tuning process very accessible, the 3.5.7 builds of BetaFlight will fly better in stock or near-stock tunes.

"They don't necessarily, however a given amount of power will be required to rotate a motor at a certain RPM with a given propeller.

kV, the voltage constant of a motor, is the maximum RPM it can turn at per volt of power supplied. Example:

A 4S (15V to make math easy) battery will turn a 2000kV motor at 30,000RPM (with no load, inefficiencies, etc)
a 6S (20V) battery will need a 1500kV motor to achieve the same RPM

In theory, the result is the same amount of power (watts) required to achieve the same RPM/power output/etc. A 4S 2000kV motor will draw say 20 amps, or 300 watts. To get the same power output, a 6S 1500kV motor will draw 15 amps (still 300 watts), and spin at the same RPM. Higher voltage but lower current generally results in less heat, because of ohm's law. Current creates energy loss over resistances (ESC components have internal (small) resistance, which is why they heat up, which is why they have a current rating in the first place).

A lot of Bardwell's videos go into the details of 4S vs 6S, but they work out to be pretty much the same. The reason larger models go with higher voltages (and lower kV to achieve the desired RPM) is because they are much higher wattage, and achieving that higher wattage strictly with higher current is unrealistic (Large scale planes would be drawing 500-600 amps at 3-4S voltages, dangerous and expensive).

To reference an earlier comment, the voltage ""rating"" of the motor is just the suggested voltage. The actual rating of the enamel coated wires would be much higher, but you will destroy components from drawing too much power under load if you went up to those voltages.

"The strength of an electromagnetic signal will attenuate (decrease in strength) over long distances between the receiver and the transmitter due to the inverse square law, but this phenomenon applies equally to all wavelengths/frequencies.

The main difference in transmission distance capability between long-range RC systems like TBS Crossfire and FrSky R9M (which use the 900 MHz ISM band) and run-of-the-mill RX systems that use the 2.4 GHz band is due to the diffraction (and reflection) of the signal by obstructions in and around the line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. This process is explained well in this Electronics.SE answer. Essentially, lower frequency (longer wavelength) signals are less susceptible to signal strength losses by reflection and diffraction because they require larger objects to affect the signal in the same way.

As the Electronics.SE answer points out, this becomes easier to conceptualize if you look at two different frequencies like 1 MHz (wavelength of 300 m) and 100 MHz (wavelength of only 3 m). If there's, for example, a house or other large object in the vicinity of the path between the transmitter and receiver, the 1 MHz signal with a wavelength of 300 m will find it a lot easier to avoid being disturbed and reflected than the 100 MHz signal with a wavelength of 3 m for the simple reason that it is just so much larger in comparison to the house.

At extremely long ranges (like over the horizon), other effects also come into play like the ability of lower frequency signals to more easily reflect off the curved surface of the earth and the ionosphere, but these kinds of transmission distances aren't an issue for RC aviation for more practical reasons. :)

2.4 GHz RC solutions are far more ubiquitous because the antennae required to transmit and receive signals at a frequency of 2.4 GHz are far smaller than those required for 900 MHz. This is due to the change in wavelength between the two frequencies and is evident in the size difference between 2.4 GHz receiver antennae and those for 900 MHz:

Futaba 2.4 GHz receiver and antenna: (The active section is silver/white in the picture)

"Assuming that you ignore all of the warning signs that your battery is low, while also assuming that you can completely deplete the voltage in your battery, the drone will ultimately reach a point where it is still providing power for the motors to spin the props, but the props won't provide enough lift to keep the drone in the air. 

The drone will start to descend slowly and will increase descent the longer time goes on.  If you are a few feet off the ground, it might look like a soft landing.  If you are a few hundred feet off the ground, it might be a hard crash.  There will also be a point where the voltage cannot provide enough power for the flight controller and receiver and other electronics on the drone, which will shut them down and at that point, if the drone is still able to fly, it will drop since motors will not be spinning at this point.

The last scenario is not likely to happen since the main electronics tend to run at very low voltages, so they will have power for a while after the motors stop spinning fast enough to provide lift to the drone.

The drone won't just give you a warning when the battery is low.  You, or the maker of the drone, need to set that up.  If it's already set up, then you should have all you need to avoid a low voltage scenario.

"Connecting the batteries in series or parallel brings two new issues with it that you need to consider before you start using them and they are both related to batteries that are not on the same charge level.

If you put two batteries of a different charge in parallel, the battery with the highest charge will charge the other one and very high currents can flow which can damage your batteries.
If you put two batteries of a different charge in series they will both discharge at the same rate during use and the battery with the lowest charge will discharge a lot deeper potentially causing a lot of damage.

So if you want to do this always take this into consideration:
Parallel connection: Make sure the batteries are at the same charge level.
Series connection: Make sure the batteries are at the same charge level AND of the same capacity.
So if you want the higher capacity and don't necessary need the higher voltage (in this case you don't): parallel connection is better and safer than in series.

"Power systems should be balanced. If you fit motors that can handle more power than the battery can provide, you're just adding unnecessary weight. That weight will reduce performance in all areas.
With electric power systems the battery is the source of the power, and everything else is little more than the transmission. If you want a 3 minute flight from a 4s1500mAh battery, that's an average of 60/3 * 3.7*4 * 1500/1000 = 444W, or 111W per motor. There will be higher burst loads but the motors have the mass to handle it. They'll heat up a little in the bursts and cool down in between.
If you switched to more aggressive motors or props you could increase performance in the bursts, at the cost of reduced flight time - and you might be pushing your battery too hard. If your battery is hot at the end of the flight, you're reducing its life.
If you push really large bursts through a small motor, there's a point where it will be less efficient (something to do with the maximum magnetic flux density of the stator, IIRC) so there is some benefit to larger motors but if your motors are cool at the end of a flight, you probably won't see any benefit from larger motors.

The cable to the receiver will be three wires joined together in a ribbon, similar to the cable on servos (and with the same plug)
The ESC also provides 5v to power the receiver and servos. All the positive and negative pins in the receiver are connected. The part of the ESC that does this is known as a BEC or 'battery eliminator circuit' because 'back in the day' you needed a separate 5v battery for the radio.
Servo cables have three wires, positive, negative and signal. Positive is in the middle so that plugging it in backwards doesn't cause short circuit. Servo plugs are pretty standard, although some have a little tab on one side to prevent them being reversed - but this requires that the receiver has a slot for the tab (and many don't, and the tabs get cut off).
Servo plugs are small and need a special crimp tool to make, so they are nearly always done for you - and they all use the same pins, so different brands are compatible.
You might also want plugs to connect the motor and ESC, either because the design routes the motor wires through the firewall, or so you can move components between models. 3.5mm bullet connectors are pretty standard here, with the male plugs on the motor (so you can safely power up an ESC without a motor).
If you shop carefully, you can probably find an ESC and motor with all the relevant plugs already attached but many only have the servo plug, either to reduce cost or to provide you with more choice. If it comes without plugs, or you need to change a plug, you will need to solder.
The Tiny Trainer is just about able to use the little red JST battery plugs that use the same pins as servo plugs, but it's right at the limit and old plugs tend to overheat, melt and short circuit. XT30 plugs would be a safer choice. XT60 plugs are much bigger than you need but a common standard for chargers and larger models. There are lots of other types of plugs these are the most common now.
Beware that the connectors such as the motor plugs or XT60 battery plugs require a larger soldering iron than the 20w irons that are usually sold for hobby electronics. Also, if you're soldering, you'll need some heat shrink tube to cover the joint. 5mm diameter fits XT60s and 3.5mm motor plugs. Remember to put the tube on the wire before you solder the joint, and slide it away from the heat or it'll shrink before you are ready.
If you are lucky enough to have a local hobby shop, they are usually very helpful in finding parts that will work together. Take a list of the recommended gear and they'll find equivalents, and may even do the soldering for a small fee.
When you're in the hobby shop, buy some spare props, some piano wire for the pushrods, control horns and swing keepers to make the attaching the push rods easier, and some Velcro strap to hold the battery in place. And a battery charger (with power supply). And some screws to hold the motor to the firewall.
",What would a basic fixed-wing electronic setup look like?,"I'm building an FT Tiny Trainer. Currently it's just a chuck glider, but now that I have tested it, I want to add electronics. At first, the plane would be a controlled glider, but then I'd probably add a motor. So far, I've figured out what transmitter/receiver I want.
However, I am clueless about motor/servos/battery. FliteTest have &quot;power packs&quot; on their store, but I don't live in America and the shipping would be horrendous. I also don't want to just buy the parts in these packs from other places - my local hobby shops wouldn't have the specific ones I need, and I'd rather avoid buying online altogether. Instead, I want to find what parts I need (servos, motor, etc) and then go down to my local hobby shop and buy them.
My question has two parts, but they link together into one answer.

The second half is: How are they linked together? What plugs into what?

Two months after I asked this, I went to my hobby shop and bought all of the components. I managed to avoid soldering (for now) by getting the guys at the shop to attach the connectors.

"A major consideration is weight reduction; if material can be removed without significantly reducing the strength of the item, this will result in an increased payload or flight duration. This is particularly evident in the motor arms of the product you linked, as the triangular shapes are renowned for their relative strength.
Another advantage of this is that it allows additional equipment to be attached easily, with cable ties or similar; in some cases I expect the cut-outs will be designed with this in mind - for example; a selection of parallel cut-outs can allow for a wider range of battery sizes to be securely attached to a frame.

"They are very different.
Brushed motors
Brushed motors are good for toy grade drones for a couple of reasons: they are cheaper and don’t require ESCs, which would add extra cost and complexity.
Brushless motors
However, in almost every way brushless motors are better: they produce much more power, are more efficient, produce more torque and, my favourite part, they don’t have physical brushes and so, unlike cheaper brushes motors which are only designed to run for a number of hours, brushless motors can take a lot of abuse and can last for years. Additionally, they are very water-resistant.
There are downsides: to a brushless motor - they require ESCs and, due to the torque, can do more damage in a crash.

"Airmode and idle up both seek to increase a control authority and stability during ultra-low throttle moves.
In normal flight, when the pilot commands the multirotor to pitch or roll (cyclic), the flight controller responds by increasing thrust on one side of the craft and decreasing thrust on the other side by the same amount proportional to the cyclic rate commanded. This symmetrical change in thrust allows for quicker rotation than would otherwise be possible if the flight controller only increased power on one side.
The trouble comes when a pilot tries to change the attitude of the multirotor when the throttle commanded by the pilot is near zero (min_throttle). The flight controller obviously can't decrease the speed of a motor below zero (aka. idle speed), so it has to do something to ensure it can achieve the cyclic rate the pilot wants. Without anything to fix this behavior, the flight controller would only respond with as much as it could without making any motors increase thrust more than the others can decrease thrust. This results in massively decreased control authority at low throttle because the flight controller can only provide minuscule adjustments to motor thrust.
This is where idle up and airmode come into play, although they solve the problem a bit differently.
Idle Up
Idle up is setting configurable in the RC transmitter which changes the throttle curve at the low end so that it the bottom-most throttle position doesn't actually correlate to the transmitter sending zero throttle to the multirotor. Instead, it would send some low value that you configure, usually below 10%.
This would allow the flight controller to speed up and slow down motors by the amount you configure for the increased idle speed, which is a lot better than what it could otherwise accomplish at low throttle.
Airmode
Most modern flight controller firmwares support airmode, including Cleanflight and Betaflight.
When enabled on the flight controller and the pilot commands a large rotation while at low throttle, the flight controller temporarily pretends that the pilot's throttle command is high enough for it to slow down motors to zero throttle and still achieve the cyclic rotation rate the pilot wants. When the pilot commands less cyclic rotation rate, the flight controller stops pretending that the throttle command is higher than it actually is.
For a graphical explanation of this functionality on paper, I recommend taking a look at Joshua Bardwell's video about airmode.
To see what this looks like visually during low-throttle maneuvers, I recommend watching Le Drib's video about idle up vs. airmode. (link starts at relelvant section)

"The difference is in how the gimbal position is sensed and reported to the processor in the transmitter. The two main types are potentiometer and hall effect gimbals, but in both types, the fundamental mechanism holding the gimbal and allowing it to rotate is the same.

Potentiometer (aka. pots)

Potentiometers are resistors which change their value depending on the location of the wiper along the resistive strip inside them. In a RC transmitter, the wiper is connected to each axis of the stick. The processor in the transmitter reads an analog voltage from the potentiometer and translates that to the axis' value.

 (cit.)

Hall Effect

A hall effect sensor also reports an analog voltage, but this time based on the strength of the magnetic field it senses. A magnet is attached to each axis of the gimbal and a hall effect sensor is placed on each side of the frame of the gimbal. The movement of the magnets either closer or further from the hall effect sensor registers as a changing value for the axis.

Comparison

Potentiometers are generally less precise than hall effect sensors and tend to drift over time, leading to a need to calibrate the center point of each axis every once in a while. This doesn't need to be done with hall effect gimbals.

"Rounded leading edges are better for subsonic aerofoils.

Props and wings have to work at a range of angles of attack. The airflow has to split to pass either side of the aerofoil, and a rounded leading edge allows the separation point to move smoothly. Sharp leading edges cause a lot of drag at extreme angles of attack when air has to flow across the sharp edge.

That said, the sharp edge on some props is just mould flash and can be sanded off with fine sand paper.

Sharp trailing edges are OK aerodynamically but easily damaged, and dings in thin plastic can cause drag, so there's a practical limit to the sharpness of a trailing edge.

"TL;DR:
Probably, but you'd likely be spending a lot of time locating a programming interface on the flight controller board and custom-compiling or custom-writing firmware to work on the special board configuration.
Some more expensive toy-grade drones may have accompanying smartphone apps that allow you to change some flight parameters, but very few of those exist for a variety of reasons.
In general, I wouldn't recommend trying to modify the firmware of cheap toy-grade drones... 😉 It's almost certainly a better use of your time and money to begin tinkering with DIY drone parts that are meant to be tweaked.

In the case of the OP's example toy drone, the Blade Inductrix FPV RTF, there is some limited good news. From looking at this image of the FC board, it can be discerned that the FC uses an off-the-shelf Atmel processor of some kind:

I've tried rotating and zooming the image to find what exact model the chip is, but the image is too coarse to read the finer print. The fact that it uses an Atmel processor means that you could probably use a UART/ISP programmer device to upload new code once you locate and solder thin wires to the appropriate legs of the LQFP package. However, you'd likely run into other challenges when trying to modify or change the existing firmware:

Attempting to de-compile the firmware on the FC to change PID constants or alike would be exceedingly difficult
The Atmel chip is likely 8-bit, which would require adaptation of open-source FC firmware like Betaflight to work (Betaflight is designed to work with STM32/ARM 32-bit processors)
The Atmel chip is almost certainly running at a slower clock speed and has less IPC capability than the chips used for DIY FPV drones and would require firmware with severely slimmed-down feature sets
The pinout of the FC board is entirely unknown; you'd have to manually trace out the circuit to find which pins on the processor lead to what parts of the drone, or locate a schematic
Critical peripherals like the IMU (accelerometers + gyroscopes), ESCs/H-bridges, RC RX, and FPV TX are likely non-standard components communicating with custom proprietary (or at least unknown) protocols that would require reverse-engineering
etc.

"Maybe!
Let's take a look at what parts from the RC car we might be able to reuse for an RC plane. You haven't shared any specific details about the RC car you're looking to salvage parts from or the RC plane you're trying to build, so I'm not able to make a specific analysis.
RC Transmitter and Receiver
One major concern is how many analog channels the RC car control system has. analog channels allow you to vary the control signal through its range of motion as opposed to having the channel just be on or off. AFAIK most RC cars only have two channels (throttle and steering) and you'll need 4-6 channels to control an RC plane (ailerons, elevator, rudder, throttle, any aux channels you may need). You probably won't be able to reuse the RC TX/RX if it doesn't have &gt;=4 analog channels.
The RC transmitter might also be less than ideal for RC aircraft control. If you have one of the pistol-grip type devices, like this one from Radiolink, you might find that operating the plane becomes cumbersome even if it has enough analog channels.

Most RC aircraft controllers are shaped quite differently for ergonomic reasons, like this one:

ESC
The major factor to consider here is the current rating of the RC car ESC. Depending on the size plane you plan to pair it with, you may need an ESC capable of supplying &gt;20-30 amps of current to the propeller's driving motor.
Assuming that the current rating for the ESC is adequate, the chances are good you'll be able to reuse the RC car ESC.
BLDC Motor
This is something you didn't ask about in your question, but I thought it would be good to mention anyway. It's possible you may be able to reuse the drive motor to power the propeller, although it's difficult to give a more specific answer without knowing more about the RC car and airplane.
As @JacobB notes:

Most RC cars use comparatively low voltage batteries (2-3s) and have a spur and pinion gear to create the necessary torque.
And because many RC cars use brushed motors (and the ones that are brushless have high Kv, like 4000 or 5000), having the motor attached directly to a propeller would likely result in either a severe lack of power and/or extremely inefficient performance.

Servos
Servos are rated for how much deflection they can provide (e.g. 45°, 90°, 180°, 360°, continuous/infinite rotation) and how much force/torque they can deliver. Again depending on the size of the aircraft you want to control, the servos you find in your RC car may be too small to control the aerodynamic surfaces of your plane.
The aerodynamic surfaces on a plane can experience decently strong forces in-flight, so it's important to make sure your servos are appropriately sized and can maintain control.

"There's a few factors that you're missing. The first is that the RC world is dominated by traditional line-of-sight control, and 2.4GHz provides more than enough range to fly a model plane to the limits of vision. There aren't many long range system because few people need them. Even for FPV, long distance flying means a long walk or losing your model when you crash.
The other is that control is very low band-width compared to video. A typical 2.4GHz protocol includes error detection and can reject a lot of packets and you won't notice so long as one or two get through every second - maybe even less when you're at extreme range and not manoeuvring hard. A video signal needs most of the data to get through to be flyable. Analog video has no error handling or rejection, and while digital systems do, there isn't enough spare bandwidth to ignore any data. Even a corrupt picture is better than black screen!
Good RC systems these days do include RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) in their telemetry, so you know when you're reaching the limits of your range - and models with GPS can be set to return-to-home automatically if they loose the RC connection.
Finally, it's entirely possible to use 72MHz on a quad, with a FC that takes individual inputs for each channel - however the range is no greater than on 2.4GHz, and there was rarely any interference rejection on the old analog radios, we used to use the glitches as an indication that we were flying too far away!
",Should VTX ever be lower freq./higher power than the control transmitter?,"I can find video transmitters from 5.8GHz down to 433MHz with the latter being ideal for longer range, but I don't see nearly as much diversity as far as control transmitters. Am i correct in saying that a lower frequency transmitter will almost always go much further than that of a higher frequency, with transmit power being secondary in affecting range? The extension of this would be that the control link would be lost far before the video if the video is TX'd on 433MHz and control on 2.4GHz. I assume that this would be dangerous since, for example, if video is gradually lost, you have a chance to return the craft to a location if better signal, but you don't have obvious warning signs for control being lost.
Edit - I know that there are 72MHz control transmitters, but i don't know of any way to use them on a quadcopter.

"The important points are:

The physical size. One of these is labelled 'BL3650', which probably means that the can is 36mm diameter and 50mm long. Of course, it doesn't have to be exactly the same size, just fit in the car.

Output shaft diameter - so it fits your gear.

Mounting bolt pattern, size and spacing.

The Kv, or speed constant, which sets how fast the motor will turn at a given voltage. This doesn't have to be exactly the same but should be within about 10%.


These are usually all specified when you buy a motor on its own, but when you buy a plug-in replacement they often don't bother to list them. If it's not listed, there's a fair chance that motors for the same size car will match the first 3 points, as cars used to use industry standard brushed motors.
If there's no Kv listed, you could compare the cars they're designed for. If the cars look like they drive at a similar speed, have similar sized wheels and gear ratios, the motors are probably a similar speed.

"The difference between outrunner and inrunner BLDC (brushless DC) motors is that an outrunner's rotor is outside the stator while an inrunner's rotor is inside the stator.

 (cit.)

In general, outrunners create more torque and rotate slower than inrunners, which usually have less torque and rotate significantly quicker. The two different designs are possible because it is relatively easy to conceptualize how to flip the order of the stator and rotor within the motor due to the fact that no mechanical commutation is necessary, unlike in a brushed motor.

Whichever side of the motor (outside or inside) that is the stator is far thicker than the other because the orientation of the coils on the stator contributes a lot of depth. Outrunners trade increased torque for decreased rotation rate because the electromotive force between the magnets and coils acts roughly at the air gap between them, which is further from the center of the motor in an outrunner, resulting in an increased moment arm and more torque. (remember that τ = F x r where τ is torque in Nm, F is the force, and r is the distance from the rotational axis)

This increased torque is critical because the BLDC motors have no gearboxes between them and the propellers, which require decent amounts of torque to spin. In other systems, motors could use gearboxes to trade speed for torque, but the requirements of multirotors to be as efficient and lightweight as possible don't allow for them to be installed.

"All LiPo batteries face a process called electrolyte decomposition. This means that all LiPo batteries will produce oxygen, some carbon dioxide, and some carbon monoxide through normal use. This process, however, is greatly sped up when certain things happen to a LiPo. 

These are the things that will cause noticeable ""puffiness"" in LiPo batteries:


Over-Discharge. Don't let a LiPo go below the minimum safe voltage (Example: if you fly your drone too long and the battery gets below ~3.3v per cell) and don't pull too much current from the LiPo. (Example: using a low C-rating LiPo, like 20c, on a high performance race drone.) Make sure you pay attention to battery voltage when flying and make sure you have suitable C-rating.
Overheat. Exposure to heat can cause battery puffiness. Make sure to let LiPo batteries cool off before charging and don't fly when it is too hot. Also, make sure to store LiPos in a cool location.
Overcharging. If a LiPo is charged higher than 4.2v per cell, it can cause puffiness. Make sure you use a good balance charger to avoid this.
Improper storage. Storing LiPos at full capacity is a major cause of puffiness. Make sure to storage charge LiPos before putting them away for any significant time. If you have a good charger, storage charge is one of the options. Also make sure to store LiPos in a cool/cold area.

"Myriad factors contribute to the current draw of a drone motor including supply voltage, motor kV, the propeller geometry (i.e. diameter, number of blades, pitch), ambient atmospheric conditions, etc.
One can make educated guesses and estimations of the current a motor will draw under known conditions, but the best and most accurate/reliable method is to test the desired setup and measure the current draw under the expected operating conditions. If you can, you should try this by assembling the motor and propeller on a thrust stand and powering the motor while measuring the current draw with an ammeter.

From the Banggood listing linked to in the OP:

The motor of interest here is the 600 kV variant, which appears to be rated for up to 6S voltage, but power draw is only displayed for 4S voltages. If we take the rough assumption that the motor's current draw will increase linearly with the supply voltage (also assuming all other conditions are unchanged), then we can estimate the current draw for the listed propellers running on a 6S batery:
$$\begin{align}
\text{New Current Draw} &amp;= \frac{\text{New Voltage}}{\text{Old Voltage}} \times \text{Old Current Draw}
\\ &amp;= \frac{6s}{4s} \times \text{Old Current Draw}
\\ &amp;= 1.5 \times \text{Old Current Draw}

NOTE: These calculations will be irrelevant if you're not using the same propellers as the ones cited in the experimental performance data.

"That's probably OK, but you should do a range test.
All transmitters have a mode that transmits a much lower power than normal, and if that is sufficient to control the model at 30 paces, full power will be enough to fly further than you can see.
From page 9 of the DX5e manual:


Face the model with the transmitter in your normal flying position. Pull and hold the trainer switch while toggling the HI/LO Rate Switch four times. The LEDs will flash and the alarm will sound indicating the system is in range check mode. note: The trainer switch must be held the entire time during the range check process; releasing the trainer switch will exit the range check mode.

You should  have    total   control of  the model   with    the trainer switch  pulled  at  30  paces   (90 feet/28 meters).



Now an Inductrix probably won't have the range of a normal receiver so don't worry if it's a little short, but you should range test every receiver you buy every time you install it in a different model. Ideally from a range of angles to make sure the antenna can't be hidden behind a large metal or carbon-fibre part.
Before doing a range test, it's important to either remove the props or ensure that the model will shut down if it loses signal, to prevent it flying away.
",How do I test if my DX5e antenna is still good?,"I have a second hand DX5e tx that I haven't really used a ton yet, just on a little Blade Inductrix, within my house. However, the upper plastic end is broken off and the actual antenna seems pretty beaten up. Is there a way to check the reliability of the antenna before I risk it on a more expensive/larger drone?

"Beta flight has helicopter modes (&quot;Heli 120&quot;, &quot;Heli 90&quot;, etc. depending on your swashplate layout), as does pretty much every other programmable flight controller software.
The outputs from the flight controller are the inputs for the ESCs, which have the same signal protocol as servos. The exception are the flight controllers with integrated ESCs, where the outputs actually drive the motors directly.
This also allows most flight controllers to be used in a fixed wing, where most of the outputs drive servos.

"Does not exist, a few reasons.

AMA lists most of their fields, but that information is spotty and I have almost been arrested trying to fly at listed AMA sites that are not valid.
FAA has this list, but they have openly admitted that infrastructure and management problems have led to this data being in decay and not very useful.  This problem was exposed as 107 was coming into law and many commercial pilots raised a stink because airports on flight maps were never (EVER) updated, this led to LAANC and the apps becoming more of an authority.
No one shares spots. There have been several apps that try to get people to share and they all went belly up real fast.

This information ALL exists in the FAA, but their data is horrible (I work with this info, total nightmare).  Most of the good fields are private and invite only in my world. We run a few spots and you will be shot dead if you fly there with out permission (not an exaggeration, I often carry when flying).
Airmap and Kittyhawk will have reasonably good current AMA type fields.  That data is the best for &quot;free&quot;.  You may want to check with Snowflake, but their data feed (last time I was involved) starts at $5k/year.
It should be noted that the FAAn NTSB, FBI, and other orgs all recognize the unstructured, uncoordinated, and non-unified nature of RC flight and use this to control airspace.  I mention this because there is considerable history on the record of the FAA trying to wipe all drone use from NAS and this is a declared strategy and we have seen it in action.

"I don't think that will be possible. The protocol for analogue radio was a 20ms packet, consisting of up to 9 pulses and a gap. So there were 10 things in a 20ms packet. The receiver would split each packet into 2ms blocks and send each block to a servo. Any pulse longer than 2ms would overlap the pulse for the next channel.
Obviously with digital radio, it's entirely possible to exceed this limit but I think it's unlikely that there will be an easy, built-in way to do it. Once you've set the end points as high as they'll go, I think that's all you can do.
You could use an Arduino to scale up the pulses you're getting from the receiver to the size you need for the servo. An Arduino Nano is a similar size and price to a servo, and easily able to handle that sort of task.
However I think you'd be better to look at why your servo needs such a long pulse. Presumably it worked OK before you modified it, so it should be able to work from a standard pulse. It's possible that you've damaged it during the modification, or that the resistance of your voltage divider is too different to the original potentiometer, or that you've connected it incorrectly.

"Airmode is a great feature if you race or fly freestyle. As you found out it spins up the motors at 0% throttle. You usually want this to be enabled since lowering the throttle to 0% would stop the motors and this results in a fast death roll of the quad.
But Airmode also helps during fast rolls when certain motors cannot spin faster or slower to get more consistent behaviour independent of the throttle position.
The default setting has airmode always actived. But you can disable the permanent airmode and enable it with a switch in the modes tab. I usually do my setup this way: One AUX channel controlls both angle mode and airmode in a way that DOWN  enables angle mode and UP enables airmode.
I take off and land in angle mode without active airmode. That way the props can stop and do not spin after arming the quad. At the same time this setup ensures that airmode is always active in acro mode.

"There are many different communication protocols used for radio controlled models and even for the same vendor the parts/versions are not always compatible. While most use the same chips to build their systems everybody uses a different protocol and so the different parts do not understand each other.
Most of the companies do not release official information how the protocols works and are not interested to make their products compatible with a competing vendor.
So if a drone claims to be DSM2 compatible there are two options: a genuine spektrum receiver is used or somebody found out how the protocol is working by reverse engineering the system.
Most cheap drones do not use genuine receivers since the product costs less than the receiver alone. The drone you linked does not state DSM2 compatiblity so I'd say the problem is that you have no compatible tx. But information on the product page is not sufficient to tell what they are using.
You could try to find out what protocol the drone uses and check if the multiprotocol project supports it: https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/Protocols_Details.md

"Short answer
The standard is that pulling the elevator stick backwards lifts the front of the quad, the same as an airplane (pull up). This is the same regardless of LOS/FPV/otherwise.
Longer answer
REalistically, whatever works for you is fine. Back in the days before electronic reversal, people would notoriously learn with the elevator backwards (this is fixed wing, so &quot;push up&quot;). This was either done because they thought this was correct (as you are thinking here), or because they couldn't reverse the mechanism and so had no choice. Some people still fly that way, however I would not feel comfortable handing someone the transmitter to one of my expensive machines if they were wary that their instinct might kick in and they push the machine nose first (this has happened to me, surprisingly with a military pilot who learned on real aircraft).
If it's more intuitive to you, and allows you to move forward in the hobby, then fine. However, it limits your ability to pick up someone else's machine and fly it. Same goes for &quot;mode 2&quot; transmitters which most of north america uses - their are arguments for and against any mode, but unless you have a compelling reason to switch, the disadvantages are negligible to comply with a majority-backed standard
",What is the standard setting for the Ele stick in FPV mode,"I've been flying quads for quite a while both line of sight and FPV. I started with Liftoff simulator FPV where I had the settings set the way that when I move the Ele stick backwards, the drone moves forward (inverted settings?). The inverted setting in FPV made more sense to me back then because the camera followed the stick.
Then I moved to line of sight flying and found the inverted stick counterintuitive. The observed drone moves in a different direction than the stick. So I learned to fly LOS in normal Ele setting.
Now I prefer normal Ele setting in LOS and inverted Ele setting in FPV and I'm wondering if  I should force myself to learn to fly in non-inverted Ele setting in FPV. I think the normal setting might give a better control over a drone if you imagine it's position in space, but that's just my assumption. On the other hand in this setting camera moves the other way than the Ele stick which feels kind of weird.

"The main thing the designers are trying to achieve is reducing tip losses by making the chord of the tip of the prop small relative to the rest of the blade. Tip losses are due to air moving around the tip from the high pressure area behind the blade to the low pressure area on the front.
Swept tips theoretically delay transonic effects as the tip approaches the speed of sound. Air speeds up as it flows around the curves of an aerofoil, and so shockwaves start to form before the whole blade reaches Mach 1. This is about 30,000rpm for a 7&quot; prop, so well about the RPM limits for glass-reinforced nylon prop. However carbon 'race' props can spin that fast. I guess that shaped developed for high-performance props have just been copied in cheaper props for marketing reasons.
The bulge (wide chord at about half span) in the last prop is because it's designed for an electric motor and doesn't have to deal with the forces that occur when an IC engine fires. The thick part of the blade is extra area away from the tip (reducing losses because more of the prop is now 'not the tip'). A prop for an IC engine would need a massive thick root to support the extra weight, but electric props don't need to be as strong, and saving weight is important.
Finally, the last prop would be a difficult shape to make from wood, where you want the grain of the wood to align with the tension.
A note about under-camber. This doesn't really do anything directly, but it's a result of picking a thin aerofoil with lots of camber. If you play with an aerofoil plotter you can see that at 2% camber and 12% thickness, the bottom is approximately flat. If you increase the camber or decrease the thickness, an under camber appears. Here again the difference is mostly because electric props don't need to be as strong as ICE props. The camber is there because the prop is optimised to work in one direction (as planes don't fly backwards) and thinner props are lighter and have less drag.
",Influence of propeller blade shape and tip shape on its behaviour?,"Newbie here, still learning how to fly and having to buy new propellers. Of the various properties to be chosen among, there are two that have me a bit baffled:

"The motor part number (Turnigy L2210C-1200) tells you two things: The 2210 is the physical size and the 1200 is the Kv rating. The Kv rating tells you the RPM (revolutions per minute) per volt applied.
The battery part number (Turnigy 5000mAh 2S1P 20C) tells you things about the battery. It is 2 cells in series and 1 parallel (2S1P). The 1P is a standard configuration. The 2 cells have a (nominal) voltage of 3.6v each, so a total of 7.2 volts. The 5000mAh says you can pull 5 amps for one hour. The 20C says you can drain it 20 times faster (at 100A) but only for a short time. This is useful for takeoffs and high speed maneuvers.
The motor specification has a minimum voltage of 7.2 volts and a maximum current of 15.8A. The ESC part number (Turnigy Plush-32 30A) is well above these requirements so everything should work together nicely.
Run Time
How long you can run the unit is not really a question that we can answer. It all depends on the drone that these things are going on. The size, weight and type of drone that you are making will determine the run time. Other factors like speed and the environment will affect the amount of time as well.
Depending on the above factors you can probably expect between 10 and 30 minutes of use. One of the stated motors running full speed would last about 20 minutes or less. Run times are exceeding difficult to calculate and actual usage will usually be less than the calculation.
With more information about the drone someone may be able to give you a better answer.

I noticed that while holding down the panic button (A button on the transmitter, channel 6), I appeared to have full control of the controls.

The plane holds the control surfaces at an angle when I hold the plane sideways, limits the throw and prevents me from applying any down elevator, indicating to me that it's in beginner mode (although this is my first plane with SAFE so I'm not certain). The SAFE only activates after I first increase the throttle - prior to that it behaves fully manually. This is extremely annoying as I consider myself a competent pilot and wish to be in full control of the aircraft.
I tried moving all of the switches on my transmitter but none changed the mode. I thought possibly the previous owner had a transmitter with more channels and bound the SAFE control to a channel which no longer exists, so I tried these instructions to bind it to channel 5 on my transmitter but it didn't work.

"Using the equations from this question
$$L = C_l \cdot A \cdot 0.5 \cdot r \cdot V^2$$
Where:

$L$ is lift force
$C_l$ is the lift coefficient
$A$ is the blade area (0.04 square meters)
$r$ is the air density (approximately 1 kg/m^3)
$V$ is the speed of the blades at about 70% of the radius

Taking the speed at $0.7r$ is only an approximation, as we should really integrate the lift over the length of the blade, to account for the tips moving faster than the root.
The required lift is 15N. (to lift 1.5kg) The maximum lift coefficient is 1.3 for a symmetrical aerofoil, according to this question.
That gives $15 = 1.3 \cdot 0.04 \cdot .5 \cdot 1 \cdot V^2$, or $V = 24m/s$
You don't specify the dimensions of your blades, only the area, so I'm going to guess that you have a 100cm diameter and 4cm chord to make the numbers easier. That is similar to a '500' size RC helicopter (which is about right for the 1.5kg weight too).
0.7 of the radius is 0.35m, and a circle of that radius has a circumference of 2.2m
24m/s divided by 2.2m is 11 revolutions per second, or 660rpm.
That seems low (normal head speed for a T-Rex 500 is 2500-3000rpm) but we're calculating the absolute lowest speed to hover, with the blades right on the edge of a stall, while this sort of heli is designed for aggressive aerobatics.
This approach also ignores losses at the blade tips and the non-lifting section near the hub and ignores the effect of downdraft on the body of the heli.

"Multirotors are inherently a very noisy environment for sensors like the gyroscope which try to measure the actual motion of the drone. Mechanical vibrations and oscillations are present all over, primarily generated by the motors but also by parts in the frame. These vibrations manifest themselves as fluctuations in the gyroscope values.

 (cit.)

Flight control firmware relies on a clean measure of how quickly the drone is moving in order to function properly, so they employ a number of techniques to ""filter"" the gyroscope signal and remove as much of the noise as possible. Unclean signals can result in more inflight oscillations and hot motors. Several different kinds of filters are used, often simultaneously, to accomplish this. (e.g. static &amp; dynamic notch filters, low/high pass filters, Kalman filters) The below image depicting the suite of filters employed by Betaflight helps get across how serious an issue this is, although it isn't quite accurate today. (the image was accurate in some 3.x versions)



RPM filtering (new in Betaflight 4.1) seeks to remove motor noise, one of the most prolific sources of vibrations on a multirotor. The frequency of motor vibrations are directly correlated with their rotation rate, so the Betaflight RPM filter takes input from the ESCs about motor speeds (using bidirectional DSHOT) and uses it to target a series of dynamic notch filters which selectively remove noise from the gyroscope values occurring at a specific frequency. There's a whole page on the Betaflight wiki about this.

Articles like this from Oscar Liang and this on the Betaflight wiki
provide instructions for how to set up and configure the RPM filter, as well as this video from Joshua Bardwell on the topic.
",What is RPM filtering in Betaflight?,"I've seen a lot of buzz lately about the supposed advantages of using the RPM filtering option introduced in Betaflight 4.1. What is it and how does it improve inflight smoothness?

"As is discussed in this Oscar Liang article, FPV hardware exists for all different kinds of frequency bands, stretching from 900 MHz to 5.8 GHz, with 5.8 GHz being the most popular today. People in our hobby have tried nearly everything under the sun. :)

Probably the most well-known tradeoff in RF is that between frequency and penetrating power. In general, higher frequency transmissions will not be able to travel as far and penetrate as many obstacles as lower frequencies.

This would make it sound like lower frequencies would always be better, but this is not the case. Especially in the case of FPV video, available bandwidth and interference issues become more of a concern than pure range.

With increased frequency comes higher bandwidth and reduced latency, which is to say that the 5.8 GHz band accessible to us can support more data throughput at a lower latency than the 2.4 GHz band. This is critical because video transmission requires several orders of magnitude more data to be sent than RC controls and telemetry do because it sends entire pictures instead of a few numbers per transmission.

The Troubles With 2.4 GHz FPV Radios

The need for more bandwidth in the 5.8 GHz range is further compounded by the fact that our analog FPV systems usually aren't frequency-hopping. In the old days of the RC hobby when airplanes were the only option, most RC transmitter/receiver systems had a fixed operating frequency. I have a couple of these transmitters, which actually have a slot where you need to insert a special crystal oscillator to select which frequency the transmitter uses!

This became a problem once people started coming together to fly and the RC hobby became more widespread. All of a sudden, people would begin turning on their transmitters at the flying field and their transmitter would talk over other people's transmitters using the same frequency, blasting them out of the sky and interrupting the controls to their plane. (does this sound familiar? XD) This issue was worsened by the fact that the 2.4 GHz band we are allowed to use doesn't allow for very many non-overlapping channels and because the 2.4 GHz band is used by many other different kinds of devices and appliances which can also step on RC transmitters' signals. 

The solution to this problem, which has been implemented in the vast majority of all 2.4 GHz RC systems, is to implement frequency-hopping. This feature allows the RC system to dynamically switch between frequencies on the fly as needed, without any input required from the pilot.

These same issues caused by transmitters stomping on each others' signals are also a massive issue in the 5.8 GHz band, but to a far lesser extent due to the vast array of different non-overlapping channels available for use.

"As @JacobB suggested in his comment, first check all the parts of your aircraft that connect directly to the battery can accept 3S or 4S voltages (usually the flight-controller and esc.) This may immediately constrain your choice.

Get the thrust per motor for your drone
Multiply this by the number of motors
Divide by two
Weigh the drone without the battery and subtract from number above

This will give you a target maximum weight for your battery. You can then choose the highest capacity battery that falls in this range.
More expensive batteries will give slightly higher mAh ratings at slightly lower weights - to work out what is good cost/flight time balance in your situation, you can estimate the flight time for a given mAh rating with the following formula:

I think the recommended motor size for the ZD550 is 3508 (like this motor) but that doesn't mean you can't use something different, like a 2814 motor, because a 2814 is fairly similar in stator volume to a 3508. This answer should help you figure out what motors you want. Torque is mostly related to motor size, so you shouldn't have to worry about not having enough torque with either a 3508 or 2814 motor. And these motors should easily be able to carry some extra weight with no problem.
As for Kv, the prop size greatly affects the recommended Kv. Here's a good explanation of Kv and how to choose the correct Kv. The ZD550 frame can fit 10''-15'' propellers, so I would recommend lower Kv (~600) for 15'' and higher Kv (~850) for 10''. Also, Kv will greatly depend on what battery you intend to use. Generally a higher voltage battery = lower Kv motor, and vice versa.
",Motor size and Kv advice for ZD550?,"I'm building my first drone out of the ZD550 frame. Most of the extra weight would be from a small gimbal like this (180g) and a gopro hero 4 (83g). What kv/size of motor would be ideal for this config, plus some extra? Some speed would also be nice :D I'm hearing around 600-900 kv, but I have no idea if that range is too vague. Also, shouldn't I be more concerned about torque? I think that's estimated through physical motor size.

"In the UK, the British Model Flying Association offer an Achievement Scheme which recognises a few levels of competence:


The Basic Proficiency Certificates provide a measure of competence for pilots operating fixed and rotary wing aircraft fitted with
stabilisation technologies.
An FPV extension is also available to holders of any Basic Proficiency or ‘A’ certificate.
The ‘A’ Certificate, which may be equated to a basic standard of safety and flying competence.
The ‘B’ Certificate, which is designed to recognise a more advanced pilot’s increased ability and knowledge, and demonstrates a high level
of safety.
The ‘C’ Certificate, Aerobatics.
The ‘C’ Certificate, Scale
The ‘C’ Certificate, Gas Turbine


As well as covering theory (air law/safety) questions, the flying skill required increases as the candidate progresses through the levels - from assisted flight, through holding level figure 8's and other manoeuvers, to being able to fly in aerobatic displays.

"Modern RC receivers that support PWM/servo output will also support other output modes, which is what the fourth row of pins are usually for.

The extra row of pins you notice on the FlySky FS-iA6B receiver is for extra features of the iBUS signal output. The regular three-high 6-channel PWM outputs are present too.

The FS-iA6B has three different major output modes:

PWM: Each channel (1-6) is output on its own servo channel
PPM: Each channel (I think either 1-8 or 1-10) is output sequentially on one servo channel in accordance with the CPPM (combined PPM) protocol

If enabled, CPPM is output on the PPM/CH1 servo channel


iBUS: Each channel is output over a serial UART connection

If enabled, serial iBUS is output on the PPM/CH1 servo channel
Special auxilary features of the iBUS protocol are available on the 4th row of pins, but these are rarely used. The iBUS signal channel provides all the features usually required fy RC aircraft.



Of the three, iBUS is preferred for use with modern hardware if its supported because of the error-resistant and precision qualities of digital signaling protocols over &quot;analog&quot; ones.

"I think it's a combination of the BEC and stiff controls.
1 amp BECs are often just linear regulators, effectively a transistor that acts like a variable resistor. It takes in battery voltage and turns some of the power into heat so that the remainder is 5v. If you were running a 2 cell battery, it would have to dissipate 7-5=2v but with a 3 cell battery it's 11-5=6v. That's three times as much, so it can only manage a third of the current.
2 servos are normally fine with that set up, but if the stiff control surfaces cause the servos to draw more power than normal they could cause the BEC output voltage to drop to the point where the receiver or ESC shuts down. Or maybe it overheats and there's a thermal cut off - I'm not really sure of the failure mode, but at least it didn't catch fire!
If you're curious, you could check to see how hot it gets, and measure the voltage at the receiver when the motor cuts. There are also servo power meters, or you could, HobbyKing seem to have discontinued theirs.
You may be able to solve the problem by freeing up the hinges and pushrods, but a better BEC is cheap and it's not a good idea to fly with a set up that you know could fail.
The better BECs are known as 'switching' because they switch the power on and off rapidly and then smooth the output, so there's much less power wasted as heat. Sometimes these are known as UBECs, because some early ones were sold under the name 'Ultimate-BEC'.
",My esc cuts the motor when I move control surfaces a lot,"I finally built my plane and started testing it on my workbench. If I moved the servos a lot (using my transmitter), the motor would cut out, the ESC would play a tone similar to when I first turn it on, and after 3-5 seconds the motor would restart. During the reset, the servos still responded. I flew the plane with issue as I knew the extreme control inputs I had given in testing wouldn't be needed in flight.
I think the problem is probably that my BEC is too small, but I'd just like your confirmation.
Details about my setup:

I am using a 3 cell battery
The ESC has a 1-amp BEC.
I am using a Spektrum AR410 receiver (although I don't think this is relevant)
I have 2x 6 gram servos on extensions.
Depending on which direction you rotate the control surfaces, they do need quite a bit of force.

"It depends on what you mean by &quot;fly&quot;
Raff d'Andrea's team at EPFL wrote a stunningly good paper on this subject, with practical demonstrations indoors and outdoors. The paper, Relaxed hover solutions for multicopters: application to algorithmic redundancy and novel vehicles,  can be found at https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/155683/2/ETH23137.pdf#page=108
They accomplish this feat of flight by relaxing the constraints on the vehicle. If the goal is to simply stay put in XYZ space, and allow as much banking, pitching, and yawing as required, then this can be done all the way down to one motor.
If, however, you would like your quadcopter to be able to lose a motor and retain full control over roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust, then it cannot be done.
Normal flight with all four motors
I'll pull from an answer at How does a quadcopter yaw?, only I'll work the example of what happens when we lose a motor.
Let's start with the driving equation:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\tau_x \\
\tau_y \\
\tau_z \\
F_z
\end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1^2 \\
\omega_2^2 \\
\omega_3^2 \\
\omega_4^2
\end{pmatrix} 
$$
What this does is it maps rotor speeds (squared) to torques about the roll, pitch, and yaw axes, as well as the net vertical thrust.
What we need to do for any desired torques and thrust is to solve for the required propeller RPM. So that means we need to multiply by the inverse of that 4x4 matrix:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \begin{pmatrix}
\tau_x \\
\tau_y \\
\tau_z \\
F_z
\end{pmatrix} =   \begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1^2 \\
\omega_2^2 \\
\omega_3^2 \\
\omega_4^2
\end{pmatrix} 
$$
For reasons we won't get into here, the inverse of that matrix exists and thus we can find the solution.
&quot;Normal&quot; flight with three motors
Let's eliminate a motor. It doesn't matter which one, so let's arbitrarily remove $\omega_4$.
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\tau_x \\
\tau_y \\
\tau_z \\
F_z
\end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; -1  \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1^2 \\
\omega_2^2 \\
\omega_3^2
\end{pmatrix} 
$$
Note that we still have the four reactions: roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust. But we only have three motors to control those four concepts, and we wind up with this 4x3 matrix. And we cannot invert a non-square matrix. So there is no ability to find three motor speeds which will independently control the four variables.
A different perspective
The takeaway from the above might not feel completely satisfactory, because it's not necessarily intuitive. So let's think about things in terms of trying to work out what happens when we try to stabilize the craft with three motors.
For the sake of argument, let's say that we are flying a + configuration where we lose the forward motor. If you look at the equations in How does a quadcopter yaw?, then you see that the reason a quadcopter can be stable in roll and pitch is that as one motor in the pair speeds up, the other slows down.
Let's allow for the remaining pitch motor to spin backwards and forwards so we can always produce a stabilizing pitching force. In this case, I think we can both agree that the average speed is going to be 0 (or close to 0). However, our roll forces remain unaffected, and so those two motors will have identical speeds, W. So what happens to yaw?
torque_z = 1*(W^2) - 1*(0^2) + 1*(W^2) - 1*(0^2) = 2W^2

So in other words, when we keep the quad from rolling and pitching, we get a really bad yaw moment!
And thus this is how Raff's team keeps their quad in the sky. They give up control of yaw.
",Why can&#39;t quadcopters handle failure of one rotor?,"Ardupilot can detect (and it logs) motor output mismatch. I think detecting in flight motor failure is possible with modern firmware and flight controllers.

"I think that puffing is generally a result of overheating, or over-discharging.
As you say, drones push their batteries hard. They can use a battery in 5 minutes and can draw very high current peaks during that flight. By comparison, a phone or laptop battery typically lasts several hours.
Similarly drones generally allow you to over-discharge. Discharging below about 15% starts to cause long-term damage, and discharging to 0% just once can kill a battery. However it's safer (and cheaper) to sacrifice some battery life rather than to have the whole drone fall out of the air - and when you have an FPV drone set up to fly for 5 minutes or less, an extra 30 seconds makes a big difference.
I believe the BMS (Battery Management System) in phones, laptops and even electric cars are designed to cut off at around 15%, for maximum battery life.
Also, DJI batteries have a built-in BMS that discharges them to 60% after 5 days.

Don't charge your batteries unless you're going to fly. The batteries are programmed to automatically discharge down to the storage level (about 60%) after left unused

Storing batteries fully charged also shortens their life, so this feature should extend their life. Normal RC batteries do not have this feature, and rely on the user to do it. Phones and laptops generally don't do this because they expect to be used daily and not left fully charged for days.
",Are drone batteries more prone to swelling than other li-ion batteries?,"I have lithium ion batteries in my cell phones, laptops, portable chargers, and all sorts of devices.

Are drone batteries more prone to puffing / swelling / whatever than other types of batteries?
Drone batteries are probably discharged at a much higher rate than cell phone or laptop batteries.  Maybe they're higher amperage too? Maybe those two things together make drone batteries more prone to swelling?
Maybe when other batteries say that they're at 100% they're really at 60% and they never actually let you charge the battery up fully to 100%?
In any of these cases, what about the Mini 2's batteries? The ones I have don't self discharge to 60% after 5 days, and I haven't seen any swelling either, so what gives?

"There are several options available for Self-Docking drones. Skydio, Icaros and Nightingale have some for security markets. There are some targeted at agriculture as well. However these may turn out to be very expensive (some number with 4 zeros behind it).
Most available drones have an RTL (return to launch) feature triggered by the user or a low battery condition.
Two way audio is probably not a feature on any expect Security type drones. You could add this, but the extra weight (speaker, mic, amp) would need to be accounted for in the payload capability.
The noise is also a consideration since most drones from 10 meters away are upwards of 70-80dB which is similar to traffic noise next to a highway. Some smaller units or hexacopters may be quieter.
It might be worth it to get a consumer grade unit and explore the possibility of customizing to fit your needs.
A note about batteries:

Higher power batteries give longer run time up to a point. Then weight becomes an issue.
The general recommendation is to have them at some reasonable temperature before use to prolong life. 'Reasonable' is anybodies guess.

Broadly, the regulations require that any drone flown in Ireland may not be operated:


if it will be a hazard to another aircraft in flight
over an assembly of 12 persons or more
farther than 300m from the person operating the drone
within 30m of any person, vessel or structure not under the control of the person operating the drone
within 5km of an aerodrome
in a ""negligent or reckless manner"" so as to ""endanger life or property of others""
more than 400ft (120m) above ground level
over urban areas
in civil or military-controlled airspace
in restricted areas (e.g. military installations, prisons, etc.)
unless the person operating the drone has permission from the landowner for take-off and landing.




Note that the situation in Ireland will change later this year (2020), when the new European Regulations on the rules and procedures for the operation of drones (or ""Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)”) come into force.

"tl;dr: In terms of radio performance, they're almost identical if you compare similar-gain models, so choose based on dimensions, durability, maintainability and other practical considerations. If you're buying, patch is usually better simply in terms of size and toughness. However, consider DIYing a helical; it's cheaper, a nice project to do, and makes a very good antenna. Only buy a premade helical if you wanna do very long range flights and don't want to bother with making one.

If you only consider the strictly RF differences between these antenna classes, they are rather subtle. These indeed are both directional antennae, and the directivity for both classes can be varied in a rather wide range depending on the particular variant of the antenna. A helical antenna would get longer as its directivity increases, while a patch would get wider. One thing that may or may not be significant is that helical antennae tend to have a very symmetrical radiation pattern, i.e. a very round beam, while the radiation pattern of patch antennae tends to flare out slightly more to certain sides. This can be significant if you're using highly-directional versions and need to point your antenna to keep your aircraft inside its cone; for a helical antenna the gain reduction would be the same no matter in which direction the antenna is misaligned, it would only depend on how much it's misaligned. For a patch antenna the direction contributes as well, though maybe subtly.

Otherwise, there's not much to say. While in theory a helical antenna is slightly more efficient, in practice each antenna's efficiency would depend more on the design and fabrication of the particular antenna than on its class. Speaking of fabrication, I must also point out here that since patch antennae are PCBs, and helical antennae are likely at least in part assembled by hand, I would expect the characteristics of patches to be a bit more consistent antenna to antenna within the same model/manufacturer. You probably wouldn't notice either way. 

The more significant characteristics are dimensions, endurance and ease of manufacture.
In the first two, patch antennae win by a long margin; they are both more compact and harder to damage in transportation or rough handling. For ease of manufacture... it depends. If you're looking at producing thousands of them, the patch also wins unequivocally, as it's just a PCB that can be automated and made very consistently and cheaply. If you need just one or two, however... The helical is far ahead. It's a very simple design that doesn't depend on things like copper thickness or the grade of material of the circuit board, its directivity can be easily set as needed by simply changing the number of turns and without recalculating anything, and it is very easy and cheap to manufacture at home using a minimum of parts and tools; the rarest of them is probably the coax connector and maybe the wire former (if you don't have plastic tubing of the right diameter or a 3D printer); the rest of the materials are probably already lying somewhere around your house.

So if I were to recommend, then:


If you're flying near yourself, don't want to worry about transporting/damaging it or want a premade antenna, go for a patch.
If you're willing to make one and/or you want to do very long range flights, AND you're okay with it being a bit bulky and less durable, helical is better.

",What is the difference between a patch and helical antenna?,"I have seen both patch and helical antenna when shopping for video receiver antennae.

"Theoretically, I don’t see why we couldn’t make current motors even smaller than they are today - we already have brushless motors with stators less than 10mm across (for example these 0802 motors), and we could change the format by using inrunner motors instead. However there are certain factors that we need to consider.

The first of these is that we can’t just have the motors - we also need the ESC boards. This is either done with a 4-in-1 ESC or 4 individual ESCs. This adds complexity, weight, size and heat buildup.

We must also consider whether or not these negatives outweigh the positives. This is up to personal opinion, and in some instances it may well be worth it, however with miniaturisation comes increases manufacturing complexity with smaller tolerances.

These are all important factors to consider: is it possible and is it worth it.

I believe it is possible, however finding enough demand may be a limiting factor.

I use a gimbal from your first link which is controlled by a stand alone Windows application using a Joystick. Same application indicates gimbal's attitude ans shows received video from a camera. It did require coding for the application. On the drone side it is all done using already existing software - Pixhawk4 flight controller, Raspberry-pi for Wi-Fi link and camera capture, Mavlink-router running on RPi to route messages to Pixhawk and gimbal.

"Technically speaking, the electrical functionality of all normally-open SPDT (single pole double throw) toggle switches are exactly the same; it's just a matter of the physical dimensions of the part. The important dimensions for matching RC TXs with toggle switches are the diameter and pitch of the threads cut into the cylindrical section, but they're unlikely to differ between radios.
 (cit.)
The kinds of SPDT toggle switches used in RC transmitters and like are so common and standardized that it's unlikely any manufacturer would go out and make their own instead of sourcing standard ones.

In regards to possible differences between FrSky Taranis QX7S and Taranis X9D switches, this RCGroups thread seems to indicate that they are interchangeable.
I don't have either product, so I can't speak from experience, but the primary plausible difference seems to be between an M6-0.75mm and an 1/4-40 (inch-TPI) thread on the switch. The replacement switches I've purchased for my own transmitters usually come with matching nuts, so I don't think the possible difference thread pitch is really a concern. M6 and 1/4 in diameters are pretty close in size, so I don't think that the diameter difference would pose much of an issue when sticking the new switch into the clearance hole in the transmitter housing.

"Use red or better. Blue and sub-red are explicitly designed to loosen with low to medium heat. (in the manual)
FWIW, thread lock is little more than an increasingly heat resistance paint, close in composition to latex paint (depending on the brand).  I have used latex paint and also nail polish in a pinch (an old trick from a car mechanic).
If you want a screw to stay, and are okay with possibly never getting it out again, there are a number of advanced and possibly no bueno tricks. All of these are from decades of mechanic work and caution is advised.

Toothpick:  Shred it, thin it out, stick it in and screw away and grind the fibers in.
Tooth pick with thread lock, glue, or paint.
Metal shavings, grind them in
Damage the correct end of the screw or thread so you get a fused connection (may never come loose &gt;&gt; aka &gt;&gt; danger zone).
In some cases, you can cover the screw with a proper cap to stop it from spinning and falling out, similar in theory to the use of a c-clip.  For example, drop solder on the top and let it &quot;cast&quot; into the head, then put electrical tape over it (not recommended, many reasons like motor may be off balance).
Copper braid or similar, just jam it up.
Re-tap and get a new screw

Your problem is most probably a combination of these factors:

heat
hot/cold expand and contract cycle
vibration
possible weakened threads (cut wide from friction).

The trick is context, experience, knowing the tools and materials, and not buying cheap stuff.
Now to the meat of the issue - BLDC motor, that is a broad designation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor), so you could be using an in- or out-runner. Big/low Kv versus smaller high Kv demands a different solution possibly.

"Often the really small/simple drones don't trim to completely stable, as their controllers are very basic and the 'step size' on the trim isn't fine enough. And, if you get them to trim, then they will usually drift again as the battery voltage changes - again, due to the simple design.
I usually just get it as close as possible, and accept there will be drift - its good object avoidance practice.
Finally, a tip - if such a small drone is going to crash, just stop the props ... this usually results in less (if any) damage to the drone or whatever it hits.
",How do I successfully stabilize or trim a TinyWhoop Nano?,"I'm a newbie to drone flying and decided to start with a TinyWhoop Nano RTF. I know just enough about model aircraft controllers from using them in robotics and animatronics that fine-tuning is necessary to get stable or centered actuators.
In the case of the Nano, I am not sure about the right procedure to trim out the rotors. My expectation was to get it to hover and then use the trim buttons to get it to stop drifting in a particular direction. It would usually drift and hit something before I could manage to figure out what direction needed to be trimmed. I finally put it in a very large open-top cardboard box to stop having to chase it all over the room.
I've gotten it to drift much less, but it still seems to be all over the place when I throttle up more. I've had problems with one of the props scraping the canopy ever so slightly, which is annoying thing to try to fix.
So I guess my question is twofold:

What's the specific method to trim a TinyWhoop Nano using the TBS controller that comes with the RTF version; and,
Is there a general process for trimming out any new quad, such as how much throttle to use and a clean environment in which to more carefully check it?

"It depends on the risk you are willing to take, but for such a small drone being flown indoors I'd give it a go1 and accept it may crash - after all, it has already done so once so it can't be made worse! The repair will, however, be a weak point in future crashes.
How well it flies will depend on how accurately you reposition the part, but you're likely to get 'close enough' (again, probably 'worth a try'.) I would also, once the glue has fully set, try to hold the drone only by the broken bit and give it a shake - if it can hold the whole weight, it should be OK when the weight is divided between the propellers.
For larger drones you should replace the part to manufacturer specs or get a professional to take a look.

"Short Answer
There are several different protocols that have different uses and different limitations. The ones mentioned that have a name like SER and description of UART are built into most controllers. Things like CAN and  USB are a bit more modern and USB replaces SER on modern computers. These last two may or may not be built into a controller.
Long Answer
The SER is an RS-232-like protocol that uses one wire for Transmit and one wire for Receive. It is one of the simplest protocols and has been around since about 1960. It is intended to connect two and only two devices together (semi-permanently) and has a lower speed than most other protocols. There is some configuration required on both devices to enable communication.
The USB protocol came out in the late 1990's to overcome some of the limitations of SER. It still has two wires but they are both used at the same time for transmit and receive. The protocol self configures so the user does not need to make any setting changes. The speed is much higher and up to 127 devices can talk on the same bus. This has replaced the SER on all modern computers and is the standard for most tables, phones, etc.
CAN also came out in the 1990's but was used almost exclusively for automotive purposes. It is somewhat similar to USB, but does not require a host computer to oversee communications. It can work at a higher voltage and is a little less susceptible to noise than USB. It also can have many devices sharing one bus.
UAS Usage
A controller is limited to (usually) 1-3 serial ports. This means it can only talk to a few things. The SER is generally used for things like Telemetry / Data collection.
The CAN is used for add-on sensors like GPS and safety devices that keep the Drone flying / moving.
The USB is used to connect the controller to the companion computer for things like software updates, data transfer, etc.
Each one has a particular use that leverages the strengths of the protocol.
","For a typical dual controller + companion computer UAS, is it normal to have UART only from controller, and USB only from companion computer?","When I'm reading the extension capability of 3DR Solo, I realise that its breakout board interface has some peculiar limitation.

"In essentially all cases I can think of, you should have no problem with switching the servo/signal connections around on your RC RX. In fact, they're usually designed with that in mind.
What likely happened is that you misidentified the physical channel order of the servo/signal channels and have them plugged in the wrong order. This is quite common, as two of the most popular default channel orders are AETR and EATR. In fact, the only difference between them is the order of the aileron (A) and elevator (E) channels!

"Antenna design is typically done to tune the transmission to a combination of specific wavelength frequency and polarity. In the case of whip antennas like those usually used on radio receivers, these are monopole antennas tuned to the 2.4ghz band (at least, the FrSky ones are. Some radios transmit on other frequencies).

By bending the antenna, you change it's ability to radiate on the proper frequency. Generally you will still get some energy on the desired frequency, but the signal will be worse because it is less efficient. It's worth noting that this only applies to the active element; in the case of the whip antennas, the black cases portion is simply feeding the short clear cased bit at the end. The only part that matters for signal strength is that bit at the end, assuming you don't damage the wire in the black cased portion.

"You'd likely be looking to run a firmware like iNav on your flight controller to enable the path-following features you need like altitude hold and mission/waypoint flying. This is really the most capable and readily available autonomous flight firmware for hobbyists.
The Naze32 FC board is based on the older and less capable STM32F103CBT6 processor (cit.), which hasn't been supported in iNav since the 1.7.2 release in July 2017 because the pace of feature development outstripped the computational power of the STM32F1xx processors.
Although you wouldn't be receiving feature/bugfix updates for iNav running on the Naze32, you would still have access to the features added prior to the 1.7.3 release that dropped support for F1 boards and almost certainly includes some sort of altitude hold and waypoint following capabilities, even if they're more rudimentary than what is available in the latest versions of the firmware.
You can install and configure iNav using the iNav Configurator and by reading the getting started documentation on the iNav wiki pages.

"From what I can tell, this occurrence sounds like something causes the flight controller to reset after a second or so, triggering it to reconnect with the ESCs as it initializes itself again.

The &quot;du-du-du beep-beep&quot; noises you point out are generated by the ESC (through the movement of the motors) to signify that they're receiving control inputs from the FC and are ready to go. More specifically, I believe that the &quot;du-du-du&quot; sounds (with ascending pitch) signal that the ESC is receiving signal pulses from the FC and the &quot;beep-beep&quot; sounds mean that the ESC is done with its own initialization process and ready to fly. (some ESCs also use the number of these pulses to indicate the number of cells in the battery they think they're connected to)
If the ESCs are detecting that the FC connects and then reconnects to them after a second or so, this likely means that something on the FC caused it to hard reset and reinitialize itself. This could be caused by anything from broken solder connections on the board to a voltage regulator that finally kicked the bucket. (or has begun to)
With respect to troubleshooting the issue and verifying that the issue is with the FC and not something else, diagnoses aren't very clear cut because the symptoms can vary from undetectable to glaring. Some dead giveaways are:

Something on the FC is getting abnormally hot
There are solder connections on the FC board which are visibly broken/intermittent
As you say, a particularly hard crash can kill/degrade FCs
Something just looks off with the FC during startup

As @Kralc helpfully mentions: (slightly paraphrased from original comment)

it can help to try unplugging parts to see if the problem changes or goes away. (Remember, it might also be a combination of parts that cause the issue, so it is good to keep notes of what you've tried) If the symptoms remain even with nothing else connected, it is more likely to be the FC.

Other symptoms are far more subtle and might not be reliably detectible by the eye. If you are able, I'd recommend trying to replace the FC if none of the above symptoms are present.

"It was the battery.
Bought a new battery, charged it, all 3 lights turned green, and motor/esc has no trouble going to full thrust. Lots of power now, so that should really help the plane fly.
Problem solved!
And on the bright side, I get to tear apart the broken 3s battery and see how to fix it or turn it into a 2s. I'll probably put a question on electrical engineering SE about that later.
",Why does motor not want to go above 2/3 thrust?,"This is related to my past ESC troubles. See link for some flight history.
I tried the recalibration as suggested by ifconfig, which sadly didn't work. But now the motor will not go above 2/3rds thrust(slight improvement), no matter the calibration range. I did do one calibration where I used full throttle as max and the center as none, and the ESC would stop working once I got above 2/3rds of the calibration range.
What it is not;

ESC overheating/overloading(it is cool to the touch and I even ran it in our deep freezer, same results)
broken ESC(I used a new ESC as well as an old one I fixed. Both have the same problem)

What I'm not sure about;

the receiver has been in some crashes, perhaps it got shaken around and is messing with the signals?
the transmitter is cheap so it might be messed up, but it was working fine before.
motor might be broken but I don't think so, it's not even scratched up.
battery(charger) might be to blame. The charger I have (also cheap) has 3 lights for the cells, and the cell 1 light never turns green(ive left it charging overnight, still red). I just thought the charger was broken, but maybe cell 1 isn't getting charged?

"I'll start by warning that you may have misconceptions that are leading you in the wrong direction. The reason that FPV screens built into transmitters are not more popular is that screens aren't bright enough to compete with sunlight. The primary function of goggles is to cut out bright reflections, so you can see the picture.
Also, transmitters are comfortable when held down at your waist, which would make the picture on these transmitters too small. You'd need something the size of a laptop or tablet computer screen to work well at arms length. The picture from an FPV camera is pretty low quality by modern TV standards, and needs all the help it can get.
The transmitters you link can't be flashed to run OpenTx. They just weren't designed to be modified like that. They may not even have enough flash memory or processing power, as OpenTx has vastly more features. Similarly Hubsan doesn't sell a stand-alone receiver for their transmitters.
You probably could buy an OpenTx radio and transplant the electronics into one of these cases, but I think you'd have to find something clever to make their TV format screens display information that was designed for a dot-matrix screen. You could look at the boards used for OSD (On Screen Display) but I imagine it would get very technical.
I think your best bet would be one of the many FPV monitors, mounted to the top of a normal transmitter - just be sure to stand in a shady spot.
",Can I re-flash the Hubsan fpv1 controller with built-in fpv screen?,"the only radio transmitters, also called remote controllers, that embed a fpv screen, for seeing what the drone sees, near the joysticks, instead of having to get obstructed vision by goggles,

"If you block the airflow into or out of a rotor, you reduce the lift it can generate (approximately) in proportion to the area you block. That means the motors will have to work harder, and your flight time will be reduced.
Work out what percentage of the total rotor area your camera will block. If it's more than about 20% you should probably look for a larger frame.
Obstructions above the rotors are less critical when hovering (as the rotors are sucking in stationary air from all sides) but in forward flight the airflow is more linear - and rotors don't like working in disturbed air so it's worse for high speed flight.

"Since you connected power to the SBUS pad it is possible that the inverter that sits between the SBUS pad and the UART pin on the microcontroller is fried.
To get around this, I would suggest connecting SBUS to another RX pad. However, since SBUS is an inverted protocol, you will first need to get the uninverted signal somehow. There are two ways to do this with the XM+ (other SBUS receivers have similar methods). The first option is to solder the wire that goes to the RX pad to the leg circled in red in the image below.

The other option is to build your own inverter using a transistor and two resistors.

The first option is probably the easiest if you feel confident enough to solder to that small pad, but it does come with an increased risk of damaging the receiver.

"As with any new technology, at first things are quite chaotic. Take my country for example, a few years ago, the regulating agency of flight introduced a scheduled drone flying program. This meant you had to make an appointment in advance with 60 days (!!!) and specify where and for how long you were flying. Also it was necessary to have your vehicle registered which at the time was a terrible process. Of course, people would still fly their vehicles and eventually this implementation has been removed and now people can fly freely.
Latest generation drones have a no-fly zone in their memory, so whenever you try to go in those areas they won't go. Flying over buildings in cities is quite challenging due to various factors I won't go into. Flying over forests while inside forests is also challenging. If you build a custom drone using a different transmission channel you can theoretically fly over building, forests and so on without any technical issues.
These rules are made for the future. As the technology will become more available for the general public, there needs to be an controlled environment so that anyone can fly their vehicle safely. Take aerial transportation for example: they have very specific routes and timeslots when each plane can fly. They most likely said the same thing as you about planes back in the 40's or 50's.
Also certain bans are against people that cannot breathe and think at the same time and would cause serious damage to their surroundings. This why I support the idea of pilot testing and registration. Pilots and decision-making people are expected to know what they are doing.
People in my country still fly these vehicles without any permits or registrations, but also the governing body doesn't care and the city police is clueless about required paperwork when flying a UAV.

"Sorry, but soldering to tiny pads is unavoidable when building a quad, especially with a tiny 2.5&quot; quad. (unless you buy one with the receiver already installed, and never need to replace anything)
I think that that receiver comes with solder pads and the option of adding a socket for that wire, or just soldering wires directly to the board. The web page for the receiver shows it both with and without a socket. However it has holes for fitting the socket, but the FC only has pads.
On a quad this small, plugs take up a significant amount of space, and there often just isn't room - or for enough slack wire to allow them to be disconnected. Also plugs can develop intermittent connections as they age (and as a result of crashes), so solder joints are generally preferred.
Get yourself a good soldering iron (they're a lot cheaper than they used to be) and a practice board (or just an old circuit board) and practice until you're confident. Or find someone who can do it for you.

"I would suggest two answers:
Answer 1: The pragmatic approach:
A good rule of thumb for estimating  power needs for RC applications is to use 100 watts per pound for sport flying, 150 for aggressive aerobatics, 200 watts per pound for 3D flying.
In our case with a 1,8 kg weight, that sound like about 4 pounds, I would suggest for sport flying at least a 400 watts system (Output power). To be more precise a 0.24 glow is providing about the equivalent of a 650 Watts brushless system.
I thrust Hacker brusless motor and I would suggest:
Engine: Hacker A30 10XL, 650 watts, Propeller 14×7 Battery 3S 2500mA, ESC 80 A (this systew will drain 50 Amps at full power, 7200 RPM at 80% efficiency). Please note that to get about 400 Watts output power you need a 650 Watts system due to the losses of the various components (see the graph for details).

If you want 'more power' , I would suggest Engine: Hacker A40 10S, 900 watts, Propeller 14×7 Battery 4S 3000mA, ESC 80 A (this systew will drain 50 Amps at full power).
Answer 2: the Aerospace engeneering approach:
Analyse the aerodinamical configuration of your aircraft using XFLR5 (https://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm), then make your math to calculate the required power for level fligh, climb and turn at desired G. Choose your Engine-propeller-ESC system using one of the simulators available online, I suggest this one: https://rcplanes.online/calc_motor.htm or this one: https://ecalc.ch/motorcalc.php?usahacker .
Please verify your system for SAFETY, appropriate configuration, Center of Gravity (it will change consitently so posiition the battery accordingly), electrical connections, battery charge, Max current for each throttle setting (measure it !) etc. Please test your modified configuration on the ground to get familiar with it. Take care of your LiPo batteries using proper SAFETY, storing, charging procedures and install an onboard battery monitor checker to monitor the health of the battery and land with a proper battery reservoir.

In this case, my old engine is an O.S. Max .25 (appr. 4 cc), plain bearing non-Schneurle, good for around 14,000 rpm with a 9dx6p (inches) Master Airscrew reinforced nylon propeller.

The primary workaround on traditional quadcopters/fixed wing aircraft is to rely heavily on multiple integrations of the accelerometer, and use the barometer as a heavily averaged baseline. This requires more sensors, but you effectively use the barometer to rule out drift in the accelerometer's readings. This is exceptionally complex if you can't predict the orientation of the can (a multirotor will be able to do this math with only one axis), but a vector sum of all axes should get you a close enough approximation
Airflow
As for airflow - you don't want direct airflow to the barometer, don't put it out in the wind. Common practice is to use a permeable foam covering the barometer - similar to how a microphone is wrapped in a very light foam to block pressure waves that will cause interference.
For the can - a similar setup might be ideal. Don't drill a single hole in a single side. You can end up with either high or low pressure depending on the orientation. I would recommend a set of holes on each axis, blocked with foam. This effectively gives you a vector sum, including slight vacuum and slight overpressure.
GPS
GPS provides altitude information. I'm not sure on the accuracy of it, but you can measure pretty consistently at 10hz, which is probably fast enough if you can trust the readings and don't have to average them
Of course, orientation and being in a metal can are issues with GPS
",Using BMP280 as an altimeter for CanSat,"Situation:
Me and my student team want to use a BMP280 air pressure sensor connected to an Arduino Nano to measure the altitude of a CanSat.

A CanSat is a coca cola can-shaped and can-sized aerial vehicle, which
can be released from a sounding-rocket or a plane-/quadcopter-type
drone, packed with scientific instruments to do predefined
measurements/operations.

In our case, this CanSat is dropped from 300m hight and has to perform an operation as close to 70m altitude as possible.
Questions:

How precisely (practically) can the BMP280 measure the altitude (given physical noise and internal tolerances of the chipset)

Where is the ideal spot to drill the measurement inlet(s) into our airframe, when the airframe is shaped like a can and is falling vertically without any drift to the 'sides', and where do we have to position the sensor in relation to the position(s) of this/these inlets?


We would really appreciate the oppinions and practical knowledge of experienced people and enthusiasts :)

"When looking for camera drones, there are several things to look out for:

GPS is a big one. It allows the quad to hold its position so you can line up the shot perfectly. It also allows auto-return functions and flight tracking.

A 3 axis gimbal is also important. You can get away with 2 axis, but three is much smoother. This allows you to angle the camera properly and holds it steady so you can get the perfect shot. It is also very useful for filming as it removes the actions of pitch and roll, and reduces yaw.

Large prop are helpful as a larger wheelbase generally means more stability.

Not that it needs saying, but brushless motors are a must.

And FPV feed to a phone or other monitor is essential to line up your shots, and also relays useful information about the state of the aircraft. 

For filming, you’ll want a neutral density or ND filter in bright conditions to make the footage smoother and add motion blur (not essential but can make footage look better).

Finally, you’d obviously want excellent battery life (at least 25 minutes) to give you time to set up and get the shot you want.

"I am a fan of &quot;More information is better&quot;. I believe that torque can be used to calculate system efficiency. I just do not know what those calculations are. I have seen one commercial thrust stand like your concept/design that includes one or two load cells that measure torque. I do not believe that measuring torque would be included in that thrust stand if there was no merit in it. Look at this similar thrust stand which also comes with data collection and reporting software. It is linked to a computer through a USB: RC Benchmark Thrust Stand It does not use a linear bearing. I like your concept very much.
I encourage you in your quest for a deeper understanding of the entire performance characteristics of your drone design. I would have a use for a sophisticated thrust stand like yours.
",How useful is knowing the torque generated by a motor prop combination?,"I'm designing a series of small drones for use in a swarm configuration in combination with terrestrial / marine / submarine robots.  As part of the process, I've designed a test rig to measure the thrust performance of various motor / propeller combinations.  The general layout of the rig is shown in the Sketchup diagram below:

 (click to enlarge)

The motor mount is attached to a plate, which is bolted to a MGN12C linear bearing block mounted on a 100mm rail. (If anyone is interested, the details of the MG series linear bearings can be downloaded here).  This particular bearing was just one I happened to have available.

At the other end of the plate, a load cell protrudes through a slot, and this is used to measure the thrust force generated by the motor / propeller combination.  The mount is designed to allow the load cell to be easily changed (I have quite a few 1kg, 3kg, 5kg, and 10kg load cells).  

The data, together with temperature and vibration measurements from an accelerometer, will be gathered using an Arduino (or possibly a Raspberry Pi if I decide to integrate the rig with other test gear).

The length of the plate means there is ample room to mount the ESC between the motor mount and the load cell.



It occurs to me that it would be fairly straightforward to modify the rig to allow the twisting force, or torque, generated by the motor / propeller combination to be measured.  Probably the simplest way with the parts I have available now would be a pair of load cells fitted between a modified motor mount and the plate attached to the linear bearing as shown here:

 (Click to enlarge)

Minimal modification to the electronics would be required to add this to the design, and I have more than enough load cells available to add this to the rig.



We had to re-design arms in a previous model when we found the forces generated by the motors caused them to deform while testing the unit on a static rig, which is why this modification appeals to me.  However, I wonder whether anyone else has any experience of using this kind of data in drone design.

So, how useful is it to know the torque generated by a motor prop combination when designing multi-rotor drones?

"Given that the drone camera is a cheap model from China, I think it's entirely possible that the camera modules is broken and could be outputting incorrectly terminated .avi files.
In earlier comments, you explain that no files are created when a known-good SD card is used to record video with the drone. My prior experience with camera modules for cheap Chinese-made RTF (ready-to-fly) drones has shown that there can be serious quality issues with the recorders. I used to have a Syma X5 model which I upgraded with the OEM camera module. The whole camera solution was shoddily made and implemented.
Based on the observations with the files created on the first SD card, one of which is unplayable but &gt;0 bytes in size and the others which are entirely empty, this seems likely. Zero-size or otherwise corrupted video files are a common symptom of an incorrectly-terminated video stream. The .avi file format supports many kinds of video streams (wiki), but the drone camera most likely uses some kind of MPEG codec with interframe compression, which is more susceptible to corruption or incorrect stream termination than a full-frame uncompressed stream.

"Like most things, it depends on how you treat it.

As far as I know, you should never need to worry about a brushless motor wearing out, especially for our purposes where we will likely demolish them before they have a chance to wear out.

You do have to watch out for the bearings and magnets, however.

With the bearings, like any mechanical component, they will eventually wear down, however this will likely not be for a long time. It is still a consideration, though.

You also have to watch out for the magnets.

Under normal circumstances, the magnets are fine to last a long time, however excessive heat can eventually demagnetise them, leading to reduced performance and eventually the motor not producing enough power for us to use.

Download LUA scripts you need, for VTX control in Betaflight its: https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-tx-lua-scripts/releases
Unzip it, you will have folders BF, SCRIPTS, SOUNDS
You need to copy these folders to the SD card root directory.  


To do this put you TX to bootloader mode and connect a USB cable to it and access the SD card
Or you can just take SD card out of TX and use card reader to connect it to the PC
If prompted during the install replace/merge existing on SD card files.  

Now put the SD Card back or disconnect the USD cable and power up the TX.
You need to go to SD Card page on OpenTX now. Depending on the version and the TX itself it can be in different places.
For example I have QX7 and OpenTX 2.3.5, I need to hold down MENU button and then hit PAGE once.
Go to BF folder and execute (by long pressing) bf.lua. Now use PAGE button to navigate to VTX page.




Additionally if you don't want to go to SD Card each time you can setup telemetry screen:  


Go to the Telemetry page of your model.  
Find a free screen (Screen 1, 2, etc.)  
Select ""Script"" type for it  
Then on the next column you select which script to display, select bf  


Now you can run this LUA script from the Home page of the model.  

Press ""PAGE"" button till the telemetry show up and then use ""PAGE"" to scroll to the screen you selected, like Screen 2, etc.  

The only thing is that if you run scripts from TELEMETRY screen, they will use MENU button to skip pages inside the script, instead of PAGE. Because PAGE  flips pages between telemetry screens.



If you have error ""Script syntax error: not enough memory"" you probably didn't check ""luac"" during the OpenTX install

"This can be caused by too much heat building up in the VTX causing the electronics to suffer. Try mounting the VTX to have more airflow around it or put a heat sink on it. Sometimes a VTX just can't handle its own output power.  

Another issue might be that electronic noise from the VTX is getting fed back into the video signal at the camera or FC connection point. Adding capacitors to various voltage rails sometimes can help.  

Still another issue could be that the VTX is drawing too much power from the regulator that is supplying it. Try connecting the VTX directly to Vbat if it can take the higher voltage.

"It really depends on the ESC. Different ESC's have different ratings.

Many ESCs would perform best under 85°C and some microcontrollers work better if under 70°C. But there are ESCs that can work just fine with hotter temperatures. For example, Castle Creations ESCs can handle a sustained 70-82°C and will have issues around 100°C but most ESCs will have lower tolerance levels and may have issues above 80°C. In general, the closer an ESC is to room temperature, the better it's longevity will be.

If an ESC gets too hot, several things could happen that would result in it burning out. Some components of the ESC could stop functioning.

So the best thing you can do is look at the temperature ratings for the specific ESCs you are looking at and measure the temperature of the ESC after a flight. If the ESC is too hot you can set a throttle limit or adjust power in some way.
